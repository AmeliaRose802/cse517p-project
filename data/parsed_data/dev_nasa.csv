"and, dave, you might want to check tv remote."
"okay, joe. just a second."
"dave, give me a call on your present activity."
"oh, just cleaning up the back of the rover, here, a little, joe."
okay.
"and, dave, we do not have our tv yet. you might want to check tv remote."
"okay, joe. f 06 23 44 26 ipp-eva it's sure hard to see the earth."
cycled it. you were in tv remote.
"okay, you might want to - -"
we're back again.
you might want to verify the aux circuit breaker in.
"that's verified, joe. the aux circuit breaker is in."
thank you.
"but you probably aren't getting it because - we haven't found the earth yet. looking into the sun, it's just tough in trying to aline this thing. 06 23 45 20 iamp-eva you want me to go out there and see if i can assist in any way, dave ?"
"no. i'm going to try it from the other side, now."
"dave, maybe the best idea is just to use the agc technique."
"yes, i will."
that's plenty good enough.
"okay. hang right there, jim, for a minute."
"okay. and you can use that background sound, too."
yes.
when you've locked on.
"oh, earth! where are you? can't get my visor. there, i think i might be able to find him."
"how are we doing, joe?"
"ha, ha."
why don't i come out and watch the egc meter.
"no, i got it."
good.
"okay, joe, you should be alined."
"okay, dave, thank you."
i'll wait till you give me a go because - make sure you've got what you need.
"dave, cycle the switch internal and external once for us, please."
all right.
internal. external.
and we got it.
good show.
thank you d.r.
"and, joe, let me verify that the position of the earth and the grid is the important thing and not the angle at which the grid intersects the local vertical. is that correct?"
"dave, that's more or less correct. i think we're satisfied with the alinement here. we just need some help on tilting our camera up to the level."
"okay, just a second."
"dave, we need some help bumping our camera up, please."
"okay, joe. work, camera!"
"okay, thank you. and i guess our only other request - -"
come on camera.
- - is to take the dust brush with you back to the lm.
"however, we may have also - -"
i can get one last pan here.
roger. and we may have overshot on the camera. we might - might have to have some help getting it back towards the horizontal.
"(laughter) okay. one last cogent on the mountain that's south of hadley. i can see some large outcrops on the upper slopes - on the upper l0 percent. and they really stand out and there's a talus do_nflow. as a matter of fact, it almost looks like we have some layering on the upper slopes - the upper l0 percent, apparently - -"
"okay, dave, we copy that. we need the camera fixed."
yes sir. going right there.
"roger, and we're interested in - -"
... 05 degrees.
roger. we're interested in moving on back towards the lm. ca_-x-ythe dust brush with you.
okay. how- how's the camera? is it okay?
back to lm.
okay.
"the camera all right now? that last time you called, the tilt-up was only up about l0 degrees."
"roger, dave. i think ed must have lost control."
"well, ed's been doing pretty good."
you're right. he has.
he has a pretty high batting average.
he surely does.
"dave and jim, we're ready for you to move the baggage up into falcon and climb in."
okay.
okay.
"as the space poet rhesling fictitious poet in robert heinlin's ""the green fields of earth"" would say, we're ready for you to come back again to the homes of men on the cool green hills of earth."
"thank you, joe. we're ready, too, but it's been great. fabulous place up here."
"dave, i'm going to start getting in."
good.
roger.

"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read?"
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read?"
"hello, houston; endeavour. loud and clear."
"roger. hear you likewise, loud and clear."
"endeavour, we'd like high gain, auto."
okay. it's in auto.
"endeavour, we need wide beam for 5 seconds and then narrow."
"endeavour, would you confirm that x-ray is on, please."
"endeavour, negative. it's - it's off right now, karl."
"roger. we'd like to have it on, please."
"roger. going on. and sorry about that, karl. i switched it one position thinking i had it in on, but it was really off."
righto.
"al, another bulletin from hadley rille. the crew is back at the lm and starting their closeout. just a few minutes ago_i saw them perform the philatelic wonder of the century."
"so, it's all out now, huh?"
roger.
"and, al, you'll be fascinated to know that galileo's theory of gravitation has been confirmed. dave just dropped a h_mmer and a feather, and they hit the ground simultaneously."
did you ask him what kind of a feather it was?
"a falcon feather; yes, indeed."
how about that.
"al, we're up to the time to turn pan camera mode, standby and power, on."
"okay, karl."
"hey, we got a few special words also on water dumps - i guess you got one coming up in about 3 hours. they're anxious, in the future, that we don't run the waste water below l0 percent, be- cause of possible malfunctions of the waste inlet valve, causing the suit exchanger to have oxygen breakthrough. so they'd appreciate your keeping a close eye on the - on waste dumps and - waste tank water quantity."
"okay, karl. will do."
"endeavour, pan camera power, off, now, please."
power is coming off.
"al, while you're eating up there, we've got the morning news. are you in a situation to listen?"
"okay; yes, ikarl. glad to hear it. ,"
"okay. it looks like we've avoided a steel strike down here. the steel workers and mauagement agreed to a one-dollar per hour day increase last night, boosting the straight time rate to $4.45 per hour. maybe we should take up that trade, huh? r rape108/4l"
sure sounds like it.
"the mercury dipped to 68 degrees yesterday, a ___ record low for the 1st of august in houston; we've had some real pleasant weather here. too bad that either you or i haven't been - had a chance to get outside to enjoy it, huh?"
"yes, wait until next week, and we'll take a vacation."
"you said it. representative edith green, democrat of oregon, said, ""students and parents have been misled into thinking that a college degree is the only road to success."" she advocated more vocational and technical training. on the sport scene, arnold palmer and jack nicklaus combined their talents to score an easy six-stroke victory in the national pga championship at ligonier, pa. they were 27 under par into 72 holes. the astros smothered montreal 8 to l, but are still in the second division, ll and a half games behind san francisco. and here is a_flash hot off the wire. it's only - it's only 200 years old, but very apropos of the leak that you sprang a couple of nights ago and also the big leak in the lm a couple of days ago. and the - the dispatch is as follows: the en- deavour, the original endeavour, sprang a leak off the great barrier reef at ll:o0 p.m. on ll june - on 11 june 1770. it was necessary for them to dump 40 tons of consumables to prevent sinking; then they sailed on with 40 feet of water in the hold. and this information comes to you courtesy of honeysuckle tracking station in australia."
"hey, that's very nice of honeysuckle to tell us that. and i guess you ought to know that when we spraug a leak the other night, we didn't notice that any water had escaped. but when i made the plane-chang e burn today, i found it, and it was sitting right in the middle of the after - of the heat shield."
(laughter) very good. how much water was there? can you estimate that?
had a great big puddle of water.
a pint?
"oh, i'd estimate maybe a pint. yes."

"al, here's a little more of an update on the opera- tion of the sim bay experiments. the gamma-ray, x-ray, and alpha-particle spectrometers are con- tinuing to collect good scientific data. i already told you about the - the x-ray data showing regional differences very clearly. i went downstairs and and looked at it myself, and it really is almost on a kilometer-by-kilometer basis you can see, when you go from a highland in - into a mare. very interesting. the laser altimeter, as i already told you, has shown a lot of interesting things about the altitudes on the moon. but i'm not sure whether you know it or not --but it's essen- tially belly up at the present time. we don't have much hope for it in the future. but the data that we did get out of it was very interesting and very good. and i guess that's about all i can say at the moment."
"roger, karl. th_nk you. that all sounds very interesting."
i'm not sure i told you previously - -
"and, karl, you say - that the laser altimeter is just about gone now, huh?"
"yes. i think most people have admitted that it's not - it's giving us useless data. it has given us useless data on the last couple of attempts to use it, and we have very little hope for it now."
"indicentally, the pan camera is deteriorat - deteriorating to some extend. that v over h prob- lem is getting - getting worse, not - it's - it's not completely bad yet, but we're getting a lower percentage of good frames, maybe 60 or 70 percent now."
"and in connection with this de - deterioration of the pan camera, there is some feeling that as time tape108/43 goes by it's getting poorer end poorer and that maybe we should occasionally pulse it on the self - test cycle to take just a - five frames on - on interesting regions as we go along in order to get the film used up before it really deteriorates to a greater degree. i guess we're asking for your opinion on that. do you have any feeling about that?"
"no, but it sounds like a good idea. it seems to me like, good or bad, it'd be a shame to leave some unused film in the camera."
"roger. well, we'll hang loose on that, and i think - i think really we ought to get a better evaluation down here as to how we - how to really use up that remaining film. people are thinking about it now."
right. i agree.
"al, when i talked about pulsing the self-test there, _ i - i didn't completely have the picture clear in my own mind. if the v over h sensor is giving us problems, this is one way to get around it, be- cause, if we take our five frames in self-test, we're essentially cutting the v over h sensor out of the circuit and taking a - a nominal image motion compensation there, which would be better for us. so it's possible that, when we wind up using that film, that we'll have somebody sitting down in the lower equipment bay probably after you're all three together again _ pulsing that switch every 30 seconds. 06 23 40 41 c_p roger, karl; understand. it sounds fine. transcript of communications between cc and i34resumed f_ apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"

"we do, but we don't - we're not - we don't have any rocks in it."
"okay; you have no weight to that. roger. and, jim, the- -"
but we shuffled the contents of - -
"the only thing we need to advise you before you go on here is to tape the caps on your long core stem, both ends of it, before you depress."
okay; we understand.
"and, ed, we shuffled - we took the contents out of bag 8 and consolidated into bag 7."
"okay. bag 8 went into bag 7. thank you. and be advised: we're going to delete your p22 to give you a little more time; we're a little bit pressed on lift-off time, now."
okay.
"hadley base, houston. observe you doing your pressure integrity check. we'd like your cuff gage read-out, please. 07 00 58 52 cdr-i_ okay. 3.7 to 3.6 in a minute."
"very good, thank you."
roger. f
"okay, houston. hadley base standing by for a go for depress."

"houston, we're into the launch prep now."
"okay; very good. and i have a couple of items on the stowage of this long core tube, when you'd like to talk about it."
"go ahead, ed."
"okay. first of all, we'd like to wrap it in the in - interim stowage shelf from your isa, and _ tape - tape that around it. and then we'd like to take two 24-inch pieces of your tiedown webbing, which is in your right-hand stowage compartment, and put that through the bslss sample bag floor fittings; two of them per fitting."
okay. understand.
and then just lay your core stem down on - in that along the plus-z 27 bulkhead. tie it down securely and then strap the bslss in place over it.
okay.
"and, falcon; houston. when you get ready to store all these bags, we have a few words for you."
"okay. we'll give you a call. 07 01 14 47 lmp-i_ and, houston, are you ready for the - battery reconfiguration?"
okay; let's have it.
okay.
"okay, falcon. we observe the batteries coming on, and i have lift-off time when you're ready."
"stand by. 07 01 16 lh lmp-lm okay, ed. i'm ready to copy the ir ascent pad. 07 o1 16 17 oc okay; i don't have an ascent pad for you, but i have the lift-off time. it 's ltl: 37:22.36."
okay. copied 171:37:22.36.
i think i heard that. let me read it back: 171:37:22.36. and i have some star changes for the ps?.
okay; go ahead.
"roger. for the p57 coming up right now, let's use star 5 and detent 3 and you should find it at a cursor of 182.2 and the spiral of 284.0. 07 01 l? 13 i_p-lm roger; i copied that."
"and, falcon, when you get around to it, how about an ed bat, check, please? 07 01 18 12 lmp-_ roger, ed. 37 on both."
thank you.
"and, ed, an e-memory dump coming down."
okay; we're ready. let her come.
on the way.
"okay. hadley base, houston. we got your e-mod. we're ready to give you an uplink if we can have po0 and data."
"all righty, poo and data. you got it."
"falcon, houston. looks like we need to do a verb 96. you're doing - going through an integration loop."
yes. i thought that po0 and data might get you in trouble. okay; how's that?
"okay; we'll try again. separate, simultaneous co_jnications link in use between cc and cm"
"al, we're ready to have gamma ray gainstep back to cent er."
okay; going shield on.
"and it looks like you're going to have your fun this rev by having a good look at aristarchus, huh?"
"yes, that's right, karl. i've looked at aristarchus a couple of times already in earthshine, and i'll tell you, even in earthshine, that thing is spec- tacular. i can see schroter's valley; it shows up very white, and the crater aristarchus with the rays extending to the west are all - they're all very, very visible."
roger.
and i'm just at the terminator now.

"we see you moving over to the antisolar point to take some gegenschein photos. it's about time we solved that problem, al. take some good ones. that nikon camera ought to do a good job for us."
"well, we are all set up here, karl; and, if the nikon will do it, we'll get them."
very good.
"did you see the seven rilles of aristarchus, al?"
"certainly did .... not much to relate at this time as far as aristarchus - descriptions - visual observations are concerned in earthshine. as a matter of fact, it was so close to the terminator that i wasn't really dark-adapted enough to see much except the very light-colored crater aristarchus and its ejecta pattern and a very light-colored schroter's valley and -which kind of surprised me. schroter's valley has about the same lightness as the interior of aristarchus itself. 07 o0 05 b9 cc roger. didn't see any red spots up there, huh?"
"no, i sure didn't."
"al, the time line on the surface is going very well now, and they're just about ready to repress."
"oh, very good."
"hey, as i look back over towards tsio - tsiolkovsky, i see your new orbit is taking you over the crater alden. do me a personal favor and sneak in a shot of it, if you can."
"okay. 07 00 16 lb cmp houston, endeavour."
"endeavour, go ahead."
"okay. you ready for me to turn the data systems, off?"
"roger, al. if you have secured the sim bay experi- ments, we're ready for the datum sic syst_2_, off."
"okay, we're secured now."
"okay, al; as you go around the corner, all of your systems are looking in good shape. have fun with the gegenschein photos."
"okay, karl; hope so, and see you around the other side."

"endeavour, houston standing by."
"houston, endeavour's on."
"okay, al. good morning."
"is it morning, ed?"
"yes, it's morning down here, al. al, we've got a couple of changes for you. we're going to delete the p22, because the lm crew needs a little extra time, and substitute a p24 from the command module for it. if you've already got your camera on the sextant, sorry about that. if not, delete it."
"okay. i've already got it on, but that's no problem."
"okay, we'll give you a p24 land mac - landmark track pad whenever you're ready. 07 01 07 05 c_ okay, go ahead."
"okay. your target's the lm. t-l, 169:34:08; t-2, 38:15; tca, 40:38; t-3, 41:06; south, 3 nautical miles; and your attitude will have changed a little, al. we're using roll, pitch, and yaw of 000, 350/231, and 000. noun 89, latitude, 26.107; longitude over 2, plus 01.828; altitude, minus 013.26; and, at 169:25 in your flight plan, change the r-2 of noun 78 to minus o8o.00."

"roger, ed; copy-"
169:15 is the time where that should be. i don't see it there.
"okay, ed. i have - i have that one in the flight plan now; at 169:15, r-2 is minus 068.00."
that's affirm; and we're substituting minus 080.00.

"falcon, the computer is yours."
roger; thank you.
"endeavour and falcon, houston. we're going to delete the vhf check at this pass just to give you a little more time."
roger.
that's fine. we just won't - bother with - the lmwith it.
"houston, falcon. do you have the torquing angles?"
"okay, you can torque."
roger; torque at 38.
"falcon, houston. how do you read?"
"go ahead, houston. 5 by."
roger. how are you coming with your stowage? we have these locations available - still-- if you're not too well stowed up yet.
"well, we were just mushing along with it by the checklist here, and why don't you go through what you have in mind? i'm sorry. we're pres- sing on. we'll take a listen to what you got here."
"okay. what we were expecting was bags 4 and 6 in the isa, bag 3 on the aft engine, - behind the aft engine, and 2 and 7 in the right and lefthand stowage compartment with 7 in the lefthand, 2 in the righthand."
"ed, let me tell you where we - where we have them."
okay.
we have - the aft engine cover is bag 3. the lefthand m_dsection is bag 2. the righthand - side is hag 7.
"and the one remaining bag, we figured we'd put in the isa."
"okay, jim. we seem to have bag - that would either be bag 4 or 6, and we seem to have both of them indicated for the isa."
"okay - we'll put - in other words, you'd like bags 4 and 6 in the isa. that would work out fine."
"that's great, and it sounds like the rest of it's as per plan. and be advised we're showing total weight of slightly in excess of 230 pounds which is a little over what we expected. however, by deleting a plane change, we're going to have plenty of fuel for it."
roger; thank you.
"falcon, houston."
"go ahead, ed."
"give us a little bit of idea of where you are, jim. we're starting to worry about time a little hit."
"we're just configuring circuit breakers, right now."
okay. one thing we do need. did you weigh your isa? and we need a weight on it_ please.
it's all weighed and stowed.
okay. have you got a weight that we can have?
stand by 1.
"ah, if it's too much trouble, ignore it, jim, but if you have it real handy, i'll take it."
we'll give you a weight here shortly.
okay; thank you.
"okay, houston; falcon."
"go ahead, falcon."
"okay. in the rendezvous radar self - test and a verb 63, i have no shaft variation - on the noun 72. the trunnion's going about a half a cycle per second, but the shaft seems to be at 220 - although the crosspointers are moving."
"okay, we copy that. stand by 1."

"yes, and it looks like it's moving in shaft; i can't really tell, but i - i - the shadow's moving and the crosspointers are moving."
okay. thank you.
"okay, houston, the designate seems to work okay. you ... - -"

okay ed. stand by 1.
"okay, ed; go with the - radar angles."
"roger; 186 and 277. and the reason for this, dave, is that the command module is a little bit more in an elliptic orbit than we're used to, and i'll have some more words about your tpi burn after while - after we look at it a little more."
"okay, fine."
"roger; his orbit's 64 by 54, about a 10-mile difference in perilune and apolune."

"endeavour, houston. we're ready to uplink you."
go ahead. you've got po0 and accept.
"what kind of range is radar giving you, dave?"
"and, falcon; houston. we will not up-link a state vector to you, your pgncs and ags are both good. and we will keep them independent."
"falcon, roger."
"endeavour, houston; the computer's yours."
"roger. ' 07 03 52 06 cc okay, falcon; houston. i have a mbfn tpi for you and some words. 07 03 52 16 i/_p-i_ go ahead. i'm ready to copy the tpi, ed."
"okay, it's an off-nominal tpi and angle. delta-v x, 66.3; delta-v y, plus 7.8; delta-v z, minus 31.2; total 73.7. tpf delta-v will be 26.0. you're going to be pointed _lmost along the line of sight for tpi. you can omit the roll maneuver for tpi, your choice. and you will undoubtedly break lock. 07 03 53 03 i24p-i24 okay, on the pad i have plus 66.3, plus 7.8, minus 31.2; and total for 73.7, and 26.0 for tpf."
"that's affirm. and the approach at tpf is going to be right along the local horizontal. 07 03 53 25 cdr-i_ okay, thanks for the information, houston. i think if radar's working good, and we get a good solution, we will probably stay heads up and go ahead and accept the breaklock."
"roger. roger. and, endeavour; houston. the same goes for you. your attitude, if you were to have to make the burn would be along the line of sight as well."
"endeavour, roger. 07 03 53 55 cdr-i_4 and, houston; falcon. i have a visual on the endeavour now. and the coas is exactly boresighted; the radar needles are boresighted, and the pngs needles are boresighted, and the ags needles are boresighted, so we're looking pretty good."
"very good, dave."
"and, falcon; houston. as far as we can tell, your ags is completely go. we see no reason for the master alarm yet. 07 ob 54 b3 cdr-i_ understand. 07 03 55 07 cdr-im okay, endeavour; falcon. i'm looking at about 94 miles 355 feet per second."
"oh, roger. i'm looking at 94 miles also. 07 03 55 17 cdr-i24 okay, good show. and the pngs state vector agrees with that."
"and, falcon; houston. you're go for an aps tpi. you have 180 feet available. 07 0b 55 48 cdr-lm oh, roger. understand. go for the aps tpi, thank you. 07 0b 56 38 cmp falcon, endeavour. you got your lights on, jim?"
okay.
"falcon, houston. 07 03 57 04 cdr-i_ houston, falcon. go. 07 0b 57 05 cc be advised your direct rendezvous tpi charts are no go because of this elliptical rendezvous. your midcourse charts are good. 07 03 57 19 cdr-i_4 okay. understand. the tpi charts are no go, and the midcourse charts are good."
roger. tracking light's on.
"i don't see your tracking lights. 07 0h 02 13 cdr-lm falcon, endeavour. i don't have your lights. 07 04 02 28 cdr-i_m okay."
"houston, falcon. what's your los time?"
"falcon, houston los in 12 minutes. 07 04 03 b1 cdr-lm roger; 12 minutes. okay. 07 04 03 37 cml yes. i got your lights now, dave."
okay. very good.
"okay, falcon; endeavour. i'm getting some large updates on you there, dave, on the first mark."
"okay. 07 04 04 49 _ that's right. yes, that's right. vhf's going okay. first optics is - is off. i bypassed two of them. i'll take the third."
"falcon, houston."
"houston, falcon. go."
"roger, we need to tweak up your pipas a little bit more, dave, before tpi."
"okay, fine. pencil's out; go ahead."
"address 1452, 05210; address 1456, 03170. and those are both verb 21 noun 01."
"okay, we copy. a verb 21 noun 01; 1452 should be 05210, and 1456 should be 03170."
good readback.
"okay, dave. the first update was the only large one. the rest of shem are all falling in."
"okay, very good. _"
"okay, houston, falcon. we're seeing a fairly large difference in z between the onboard solutions and the ground solutions. but, i guess that can be expected at the recycle."
"i'm checking it for you now, dave. your pgns and ags seem to agree pretty well."
roger. and i think we can expect a fairly large z at the recycle.
i'll give back some words on the msfn tpi in a minut e. 07 04 09 35 cdr-i_ roger.
"falcon, houston. we're going to watch it for a few more minutes and see how they converge with the other solution."
roger.
"okay, dave. i've got a recycle solution for you. roger. minus 69.4, minus 6.2, plus 12.0."
"endeavour, houston. i need omni alfa."
"omni alfa. t_-_ 07 04 12 15 cc and, falcon; houston."
"houston, falcon. go."
"roger, fido thinks you had a good solution, but not a great solution before. he's now saying the z component will be - should converge to about a minus 19. and if it does, your approach angle with be more nominal - rather than along the horizont al."
"okay, that sounds like we're all converging to the same spot. thank you."
"we agree, dave. 07 04 14 14 lmp-im okay, houston; falcon. our polar plot is showing us pretty nominal. i guess we'll probably stay with the nominal procedures on the tpi."
"roger, falcon. we have you a minute to los. your solutions look good in both computers. we'll see _ou on the other side. and be advised: we did _tto_our ii_ff, 6n_ _ can confirm you l_fted off."
"well, very good. that's nice to know, thank you much. save the tapes for us, will you."
"say again, please."
"save the tv tapes for us, will you please."
"will do, and you're 30 seconds from los, falcon. 07 04 15 04 cdr-i24 roger. see you around the corner."
"ro_ger, roger, dave."
"and, endeavour; houston. i have you 30 seconds from los."
"endeavour, roger. see you on the other side."
"okeydoke, al. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription 07 04 39 -- begin lunar rev 49"
"falcon, houston. standing by."
"roger, houston. falcon had a good tpi; it burned a small midcourse l, and a small midcourse 2. presently, we have a visual on the command module and all the solutions have been agreeing very well."
"okay. did you write down your solutions, dave?"
"yes, we got them all in."
okay. we'll ask you for them later. f 07 05 02 57 cdr-lm okay.
"houston, endeavour."
"hello, endeavour. standing by."
"okay, tv's up to ..."
"say again. 07 05 04 lb cc roger, copy. tv's on."
"endeavour, houston. we're not tracking your high gain, yet."
okay.
"we have your picture, endeavour."
roger.
"okay, i've got you visually there, falcon."
yes. you're looking good.
"you're very garbled, dave. say again."
"okay, i got you at 1.28 mile."
"okay, we're right with you."
"endeavour, houston. give us auto on the high gain, please. 07 05 08 40 cml on auto. 07 05 09 13 cdr-imm okay, i mile and 27 feet per second on the radar."
roger.
"endeavour, houston. do you have the falcon on your monitor?"
"no, i wasn't watching it, ed. stand by 1."
"okay, 3000 feet, braking down to 20."
"don't waste any time on it, al. 07 05 12 18 lmp-_ okay, 1500 feet,braking down to 10. 07 05 14 ll lmp-_ okay, 500, braking to 5."
...
... falcon ...
"okay, houston. we're station""keeping at about 120 feet or so."
"roger. dave, during the command module pitch- around, we'd like for you to take a look at the v over h sensor in the sim bay, if you can. do you know how to spot it?"
the which sensor?
"v over h. 07 05 16 17 i/_p-_ yes, it's - it's on the pan camera gadget."
"okay, i guess we're not - well, al's talking to us."
"okay, what we're looking for is to see if any- thing is in the way of the lens of that sensor. if you're not f_iliar, i can give you a page number in your lm data systems book. just take a look at it."
"okay, stand by 1."
"no, it's not - it's not on the lens, dave. it's right alongside the lens on the body of the cam- era - -"
"we've got a picture of it, al."
- - it tells us what speed to take the pictures at.
"okay, we'll get a picture of it."
okay. _ 07 05 17 20 cmp okay. i'll go ahead and do your piteharound.
"and, dave, give me - give me a call when you start. 07 05 17 45 cdr-i_ okay."
"houston, what page is that on in the lm systems book?"
okay. it's pa_e 43 in the lm systems bo - data book.
okay.
"okay. on the right-hand side, dave, you see that one little line that says, ""mapping and pan cameras n2 press systems assembly."" f 07 05 18 21 cdr-lm we haven't got it out yet. stand by."
okay.
"yes, i'll go the higher rate, dave."
"okay, here we go. 07 05 19 03 lmp-_ go ahead."
"hey, it looks good, you're going the right way."
"dave, while he's pitching, i'll tell you - should be about the middle of the sim bay by the mapping camera."
"very nice maneuver, endeavour."
"okay, houston. we don't see it labeled in here. where - is it labeled on the picture?"
"negative. as soon as you have the picture, i'll tell you where to look."
"okay, we got the picture; tell us where to look."
"okay, way over on the right-hand side, where it says, ""mapping and pan cameras n2 press system assembly."""
it's on the right picture.
the one with the covers open?
"that's affirm. between the end of that arrow and the lens, about halfway, is a little dot that represents the v over h assembly. now, the camera lens will be covered - rather it will be folded up so you will not be able to see it; however, that is the item you are looking for, represented by the small circle about halfway in between the end of the arrow and the lens of the camera."
"okay, i see a small circular object there just - just to the right of the handle, and i don't see anything covering it."
are you talking about the diagram or in the sim bay.
"no, in the sim bay. 07 05 22 b0 cc okay. that's what we wanted to know."
"yes, it's a little round, black - -"
"that's it - that's it. 07 05 22 h0 cdr-lm - - ... type of affair, right?"
"if you can snap a picture of it, we'd appreciate it."
"okay, we'll get one, ed. stand by."
"okay, we've got the picture, houston, and we'll proceed on with the docking."
"thank you, sir. 07 05 23 39 cml okay, i'll pitch back around now, davy."
okay.
"and, falcon; houston. do you have any comments on the sim bay, anything look out of the ordinary?"
"no, it looks very clean. the doors are all covered, and all the booms are retracted; and it looks neat and tidy."
thank you.
"okay, where'd you go ? 07 05 25 30 cdh-lm we should be right where we were. have you com- pleted your _ueuver?"
"roger. 07 05 25 34 cdr-i_m okay, we're in the same inertial attitude, i'll come back around to you ...."
there you are.
"okay, endeavour. would you handle stationkeeping, we're going to pitch and yaw now."
okay.
pitching down.
okay.
"okay .... endeavour, it's all yours."
"okay, houston. ready to get ... arm, on."
stand by. 07 05 30 26 cml roger. i'll ... turn on the logic when you're re ady.
"okay, bring it on. 07 05 b0 34 cmp logic i - logic 2. 07 05 b0 48 cc go for pyro arm."
roger. 07 05 35 52 cm_ ... barber pole. 07 05 35 54 cdr-i_m ...
roger. 07 05 35 58 cdr-ijm ...?
okay. you ready to come in?
all set.
hard dock.
"roger. roger. copy hard dock. and, falcon, if you'll give us 105 and 67, we should have your steerable . 07 05 36 41 _ roger. 105 and 67. 07 05 36 51 $r good show, endeavour. it's nice to be aboard again."
welcome home.
thank you.
"and falcon, houston. now that we have the steer- able back, when you get a moment, pull the ecs auto transfer, open, and then the glycol pump 1 open."
roger. ecs auto transfer is open - and i'll open _ the glycol pump 1 now.
roger. we want to get a little data down here.
"okay, do you want us to select 2, or just let it run?"
negative. just wait for 30 seconds.
"okay, we'll stand by for your call."
thank you.
"and, houston; falcon. do you have an update for us for the lm weight/csm weight?"
"roger. stand by. lm weight, 5444. 07 05 38 09 i_p roger. lm weight 5444."
and i don't have a csm weight at the moment. and you can close the glycol pump i first and then the auto transfer.
roger. closing glycol pump 1 now - auto transfer now.
"roger, and i thank you."
"go ahead. all right, i got it."
"and, endeavour; houston. a couple of changes to the command module - i_4/command module transfer list on stowage items, when you get a break."
"okay, houston. stand by 1."
"and, falcon, we'll take data and up-link you."
you've got it.
"okay, houston; endeavour. you might as well give me those updates now."
"okeydoke, endeavour. on page 2 - 283 -"
"okay, go. z"
"okay, al. about the middle of the i_mto command module transfer list, the second decom bag and the fourth decom bag - scratch."
understand. scratch second and fourth decom bags.
"that's affirm. and the - at the bottom, write ""collection bag (3) in a-9."""
"understand. add ""collection bag (3) in a-9."""
"roger. and they're going to give you a - a sec- tion of core stem, three sections long, you'll have to put that on the left-hand tray along a-1 and a-2, and secure it with - with either you i_ tiedown rope or your extra webbing in there."
"roger. i understand. the core tubes go along a-l, a-2, tied down on the tray."
that's affirm. you got it.
"dave, you want to verify that the dump valve's in auto?"
roger. standby 1.
verify.
"okay, i'll go ahead and start equalizing the pres- sure."
"okay, good."
"and, falcon; flight - or rather, falcon, houston. fido's on pins and needles for your tpi solution if you can get a moment to read it to us."
"roger, we'll do it right now."
"okay, houston. i assume that you got the recycle before we went around the corner there."
"that's affirm. 07 05 4b 47 cdr okay, on the final comp, i'll read pgns, ags and cmc, if you are ready to copy them, in that order, in local-vertical coordinates."
roger. ready.
"okay_ for the pgns: plus 70.3, plus 5.9, minus 17.7. for the ags: ""pius 70.4, plus 5.9, minus 19.1. the cmc: minus 69.1, minus 6.1, plus 16.1. we burned the pgns on time, and we had about a 4- foot-per-second overburn on the aps, which we trimmed out to 2/10ths."
copy.
"okay, the residuals were - for the pgns after the trim - were plus .2, plus .2, and minus .4."
copy. and assume midcourses were ...
"roger. we'll give you those, too."
"okay, and i'll give you the same answers for mid- course 1 if you're ready to copy, houston. -- 07 05 45 31 cc okay."
"okay, pgns was minus 1.1, o, and minus 1.1. ags was minus 1.5, o, and minus b.0. cs - csm, plus 1.5, minus .2, plus 1.9. and we burned the pgns solution to o.1 and .2. 07 05 46 ob cc thank you, dave, that's fine. appreciate it."
"okay, you want midcourse 2?"
"no, we'll take you pgns - we'll take all the rest of them; we'll get them later."
"okay, fine. it was pretty smooth all the way, every thing looked nice, and the data went in very well, and i thought it was a super rendezvous."
"very good. getting home's the main thing. 07 05 46 b2 cdr yes, but you know, these systems are just magnifi- cent. 07 05 46 b6 cc yes, they sure are, dave. okay, we suggest you press right along with your transfer and cleaning up."
roger. we're in work right now.
"and whenever jim's ready to do the targeting, we'll read him a pad on that."
"okay, stand by, we'll give you a call. 07 05 47 42 _ okay, ed. i'm ready to copy the impact pad."
"okay, understand you're ready for the lm impact pad, jim; is that correct? 07 05 47 56 _ yes, if that's what you have to pass."
"okay, it's a p30 pad. 179:06:22.50_ noun 81, minus 0121.9, plus 0056.0, plus 0148.8; o071.1 minus 0037.1, 0200.3; 1:27; 047, 174. the rest is na. and the lm weight is 5444."
"roger. readback for p30 pad. 179:06:22.50; minus 0121.9, plus 0056.0, plus 0148.8; o071.1, minus 0037.1, 0200.3; 1:27; 47, 174. and lm weight is 5444."
"good readback, jim."
"and, falcon; houston. the computer's yours."
roger.
"and we want to leave it in data, of course."
"okay, we'll leave it in data. it's all yours now."
"and, endeavour; houston. before you get los and get too busy with transfer, i need to give you a camera photo pad for the next pass."
"okay. go ahead, houston."
"okay, this is the one on that 174:50, al. t-start - for the map camera - t-start, 174:50:04; t-stop, 175:49:36. your image motion bp plus 4 at t-start, and bp at 175:30:00. and your pan camera photo pad, to be copied at 175:20. t-start, 175:34:32; t-stop is 36:52."
"roger, ed. understand mapping camera photo pad is t-start, 174:50:04; t,stop, 175:49:26. and at t- start, you want image motion to go barber pole plus 4."
that's affirm.
"and, at 175:30, understand you want image motion to go to barber pole."
"that's affirm, al. and the correct time for the t-stop on that was 175:49:36."
"understand, 49:36."
"and the pan camera photo pad is t-start, 175:35:42; t-stop, 175:36:52."
"roger. the t-start, 175:34:32; t-stop is good."
"understand, t-start is 175:34:32."
"that's a good readback now, al."
"yes, it's, pressurized, jim. can you read me? okay, tunnel's pressurized and i'm up in it now, checking the latching."
"hello, houston. the falcon is .back on its roost and going to sleep."
very good.
"she's all yours now, ed. we're going to go off coremand put her to bed."
"okay, one item, dave. you're not marking these bags before you hand them to al, are you?"
"the bags are all numbered. we've got the collec- tion bags in the cover bags with the proper numbers on them, and that was all we were planning to do."
"okay, you're not helping him with the stowage when you pass them in, are you? i would change your flight plan if you did; otherwise, i'll just give it to him."
"well, i guess the best thing would be to go ahead and give it to him, because we'll just pass them over then."
"okay, i've given them to him already. thank you. 07 05 58 4b cdr yes, that fine, he - he's got a much better handle on the stowage over there anyway than we do."
"endeavour, houston."
"houston, endeavour. go ahead."
"al, we observed when you were in p79, just before the docking, that you got a p00 d00. do you have any words on that?"
"no, i don't, ed."
"and, endeavour; houston. we're going to have to update your flight plan with a couple of items before you go around the corner, whenever you can get around to it."
"okay, ed, let's go ahead and do them now."
"roger. and, al, give us a verb 74 while i'm' talking to you."
"roger. verb 74. 07 06 0b 24 cc okay, the first flight plan update is the - at 174:12. 07 06 03 b7 cmp okay, go ahead. 07 06 0b b9 cc okay, where it says the ""mapping camera laser ex- periment covers, open,"" et cetera, et cetera - de- lete that."
roger. go ahead.
"and the second line after that, the '_ap camera trackj"" et cetera, et cetera; delete that, we're going to move those to 174:40."
"okay, understand."
"okay, down a little bit in the next group of words where it says ""laser altimeter, on"" at 174:17, we're going to scratch that."
"okay, scratch laser altimeter."
we're going to move that to 174:49.
roger. move to 174:49.
"okay, and at 175:49, going to add a - another laser altime'i'_, 0ff. 07 06 05 07 cn5 roger, understand. at 175:49, laser altimeters, off."
"okay, the next item is at i - stand by on that a minute. and at 175: 54, delete the laser altimeter, off. _ 07 06 05 37 cmp understand. at 175:58 sic, delete laser altimeter, off."
that's affirm.
okay.
"and at 176:02, the next page right after all those words, we want to add in the ""map camera"" - that's about 176:02 - ""map camera/laser experiment covers, close, talkback's barber pole, flash gray, then off."""
"looks like that item came down there about 4 min- utes later, al."
"roger that, i see it now."
"yes, i just now saw it, too. i presume they want it moved up there a few minutes. and at 178:02; oh, sorry about that - at 177:56, put in a ""logic pow_ (2), off. '"
"okay, i understand logic power, both of them, off, at 177:56."
"roger. next page, 178:02, ""laser altimeter, on,"" delete."
"delete ""laser altimeter, on,"" at 178:02."
"okay. and at 179:40, following page, delete ""laser altimeter, off"" - and about 179:41, delete those two lines, ""map camera/laser experiment covers"" and ""logic power (2), off."" delete those. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
"okay. delete the three lines at 179:40, ""laser altimeter,"" ""mapping camera covers,"" and ""logic power, off."" delete those three lines."
"okay. i think we got them all that time, al. thank you."
okay.
"and, endeavour, houston. if you can holler at dave and jim, remind them that - to get their radiation meters out of their pockets. we'd still like those readings we didn't get earlier."
"roger, houston. f 07 06 10 48 cc okay, endeavour, houston. can we have auto on the high gain? and request falcon to go to aft omni as he goes over the hill or after he's over the hill."
okay. you want falcon to go a_t o_i.
"yes, at los. and you're about 3 and a half min- utes from los now."
"okay, i'm in auto and they're going to go to aft omni at los."
"that's firm. and ask them when they do that to verify track mode, slew."
"and, endeavour, we're about 40 seconds from los; see you on the other side."
"okay, ed. thanks much. 07 06 37 -- begin lunar rev 50"
"apollo 15, houston. standing by."
"houston, 15. still in the midst of doing a little house cleaning."
"okay; kind of figured that, al."
"endeavour, houston. would you ask falcon to switch to forward omni?"
"roger, houston."
"and, al, do you want to verify - verify that you got your mapping camera started at 174:507"
"yes. roger, ed. was i minute late on that - on the mapping camera, but we got it started at i - at 174:51."
"okay, al. thank you."
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"roger, ed. one other thing, i didn't get the p52 put in."
"okay, i understand, no p52."
affirm.
"al, i'll keep track of your cameras for you and give you a warning on the stops and starts."
"okay; if you would, that would help."
"15, houston. give me -i_acq and narrow, please."
"okay,-reacq and narrow."
"15, houson. we're having a 10t of trouble with the i_ comm. apparently, we're right in - in the midst of the omni. let's try aft again, please."
"houston, i was talking with dave. say again."
"roger. let's try the ia_a_t omi again, please. 07 07 16'21 cc 15, houston."
"roger, houston. go ahead."
"how about the ga/_4a ray gain switch? snap it _ three times for us, please, al."
"okay, three times."
"apollo 15, houston."
"houston, 15."
"al, we're going to change your mapping camera procedures. i'm going to call them to you on time rather than read them to you now. so press on, and i'll give you a warning here in about 5 or 6 minutes."
"yes, that'd be fine, ed. just give me a couple minute warnings, so i can get over to the camera. as you probably know, the leb timer's not work- ing."
roger. i'll keep you posted on time; press on.
"okay. 07 07 2_ 56 cc apollo 15, houston."
"go ahead, houston."

"okay. 07 07 25 _6 cmp houston, 15. 07 07 25 _8 cc go ahead."
roger. that just happened about 15 seconds ago. you must have caught it just as it went to p00. and i don't think we're even out of the dead - band.
"very good. and, al - yes, stand by. we still got a couple of minutes yet. what i'm going to do is have you retract the mapping camera with it still running and then turn it off. we're running a little test on it. and i'll call back for you in a couple of minutes."
okay.
"apollo 15, houston. stand by to retract the mapping camera."
"okay, standing by."
mark. start retracting.
okay; it's retracting now.
"take about 4 minutes, al, and i'll call you after that."
okay.
"okay. apollo 15, houston. turn your mapping camera, off."
"okay, ed. mapping camera going off."
"roger. the laser altimeter, off. and the map camera/laser covers, closed."
"okay, laser altimeter's off."
and i'll have the pan camera t-start here in just about 2 minutes. i'll call you and give you 15 or 20 seconds warning. 07 07 32 28 c94p okay.
"15, houston. stand by for t-start on the pan camera."

yes.
"apollo 15, houston."
"houston, apollo 15. go."
"say, dave, beautiful job there today all the way around. hey, one quick question - how come you guys need plugs for those suits?"
"well, because, apparently, the lcg connection on the inside won't hold - an air seal, so we're getting them taken care of with these special - extra little blue plugs we got that are air tight on the inside."
at least that's our first guess of - of why we didn't get a good suit integrity check or didn't even get a good buildup in the suit pressure.
"roger. we - we had a complete misunderstanding on that, so that's the reason i asked the ques- tion, because we thought those plugs only were required when the lcg was not on. we're trying to crack that one for you down here, dave. there's something screwy here. tapell/6 07 09 ll hl cdr okay. well, we'll put these plugs in and run another pressure integrity check and see how it works. 07 09 11 h6 cc roger. · page 1225 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"

inside plugs.
roger.
"okay, houston, 15. we've got a good suit circuit now."

"okay, the lm/cm delta-p doesn't look exactly right to us. what do you think? 07 09 2b 49 cc stand by. 07 09 24 b2 cc 15, houston. we'd like to get another pound out of there. we're showing about 3.5 in there."
"okay. we had a suspicion that possibly the lm overhead dump valve was open, and it might be."
we don't think so down here.
"okay. well, we'll go to tunnel vent for a little longer, must just be slow then; we've been in it for probably about 15 minutes."
copy.
"15, what position are you in when you're reading that out, in vent or in delta-p? 07 09 25 b4 cdr delta-p. 07 09 25 b7 cc roger. 07 09 25 4b cdr it's up to about 2.b now, and i've been holding it in tunnel vent."
"15, we'll take that. it'd take too long to get it _ down, we believe. so let's press on with jett at that pressure."
"okay, well, the strange thing about it is that we had it up to about - oh 2.7 or 2.8 at one time and then went back to lm/cm delta-p, and for some reason it built back up in the _unnel. and, i guess the only conclusion we could come to was - from the lm, because the hatch is pretty simple and secure in here."
"dave, we think that the increase in the cabin pressure during the suit integrity check could have raised it frc_ - from your side."
"well, okay, that's - that's true."
"bye, dave; confusion reigns down here. 07 09 27 l_ cdr could you see any ch - well, i guess it sort of does up here, too. i wonder if you see any dif- ference in the - you can't read the t,_nnel, tho,_h, can you? 07 09 28 2_ cc and, 15; this is houston. we'd like to verify that you did get a good hatch integrity check back there a ways."
"yes, that's firm. we got a good hatch integrity check, but - i guess what i'm thinking is there's - you know, there could be something in the seal there. and perhaps the thing to do would be to repressurize the tunnel and pull the hatch down, and take a good close look at the seal and then stick it back in. it shouldn't take too long. 07 09 29 3b cc apollo 15, houston. that seems to be about the best conclusion we can come to down here, but we're - kind of like to go into a hold briefly. another indication is that we would - we are seeing the i2_cabin holding steady and not using any oxygen from the ascent tanks, which seems to say that we're not leaking into the tunuel from the lm. 07 09 bo 02 cdr okay, understand. 07 09 30 08 _ do we? 07 09 30 _4 cc 15, houston. we'd like to verify that the pressure _- equalization valve is closed. 07 09 30 5h cdr that's verified; it's closed and on the yellow strips."
roger.
"and, 15, we'd like to back out of your pyro arm situation right now."
"okay, houston, 15. pyro arm is safe, logic is off, and the pyro arm circuit breakers are pulled."
copy.
"15, can you give us a lm/cm delta-p reading at this time; please?"
"okay, right now it's 3.0."
"copy, 3.0."
"and, i've had the valve in tunnel vent for the last 5 minutes or so."
copy.
"apollo 15, houston. recommendation right now is to stop the - the lm tunnel vent, and then we will sit and monitor the cm/iam delta-p for a short while to see what happens to it. and, after that, we're still considering opening up the tunnel to check the seal. over."
"okay, we're in lm/cm delta-p right now, and it's reading about 3.1."
"copy, 3.1."
"15, we'd like to pull the b/d roll jets. 07 09 36 43 iamp roger. b/d roll jets coming off."
"and, 15, if one of you has a chance, would you put x-ray to standby, please?"
roger x-ray to standby.
"okay, houston; it's in standby."
thank you.
"15, houston. you give us a reading now on that?"
"okay, houston; stand by 1."
"it's just a little under 3.1, just a - just a hairline."
"roger; copy. and we're still looking at the possibility of opening the hatch. we're just trying to - right now, trying to understand the f situation before we open the hatch and destroy the configuration we're in."
"okay, we'll stand by."
"and, 15; houston. could we have another reading in l0 minutes?"
"well, it's reading right now just about the same that it was when i last called you."
"roger; copy. there's certainly enough uneasiness down here that we think we ought to proceed back through and open both the command module hatch and the i_ hatch, check the seals on both and the relief valves on both, proceed back through that doing - doing those checks, because there could be a very slight leak from the iamthat the telemeter guys -- would not see at - for this small volume in the tunnel. over."
"roger. we sort of think that's a good idea, too. we'll proceed. 07 09 47 b1 cc roger. keep us posted when convenient. 07 09 47 b6 cdr roger. will do."
"15, just in case you haven't got the idea, when i said check the seals, i mean clean them, too. 07 09 48 ob cdr roger. understand. we'll make sure they're good and clean."
"okay, houston; 15. both hatch seals are clean, and both hatches are now closed and locked. do you want to vent the tunnel again?"
"roger. go ahead, dave. thank you."
"and, 15, are you guys all still fully suited?"
roger. we did not break down the suits; we're still locked up.
roger.
and the lm overhead dump valve was verified in auto.

"okay, houston. we're 1.3 on - delta-p and coming - coming up."
copy.
"okay, houston; we're about 2.2. 07 l0 01 h6 cc copy."
"and, houston, do you want to go to 3 and let it stabilize there?"
"i guess we'll do per the checklist which is 3.5, right?"
"well, not really. our checklist says before jettison only,i_ tunnel vent valve, i/_tunnel vent at least l0 minutes, period."
okay. stand by.
"course that's after the hatch integrity check. if we want to go ahead and run through the full hatch integrity check, then we'd run up to 3.5 and then run another l0 minutes, i guess. 07 l0 02 h8 cc yes, that's the point, dave. we want to run a complete ha - hatch integrity check; in fact, we'll proba - we may ask you to run it longer than usual."
okay.
"obviously, what we're thinking about here is a bad _ hatch seal, so we're particularly interested in that."
"roger. 07 l0 0h 09 cc and, 15, a reminder. when you're on the back side, lm is still in 5-degree dead band, so play it cool with the c....a.n.d..module. 07 l0 oh 22 cdr roger. pase 1233. 07 10 05 58 c_ _ and, 15, what we'd like to see you do is leave %hat tunnel at 3.5 for the entire back'side pass, and we'll see what happens to that leak rate. that gives us a nice, long leak check on the hatch. and, we'll be satisfied with that delta-p for jett, if that's the way it works out on the other side."
"okay. and, i guess in that case, we'll probably break the suits down and then run another suit check before we see you around the corner. so -"
"okay, we'll buy that."
it's about time for dinner.
i knew there was a reason.
"roger. okay, we're about 3.2 now on the delta-p. we'll leave lm in vent."
roger. i understand; 3.2 and still venting.
roger.
"dave, stand by on taking your suits off; if you haven't taken them off already."
okay. we hadn't planned to take our suits off; we're just going to break off the helmets and gloves so we could get something to eat.
roger. but stand by on breaking the suits down; because it's a debate as to whether we want to do another suit integrity check.
okay.
"15, press on. you may - you are permitted to _ break the suits down, but do not do the suit integrity check until you come back around the other side; we can take a_other look at that tunnel. over."
roger; understand. we'll break them down and hold off until we see you on the other side.

"houston, apollo 15. go ahead."
roger. do you - roger. do you have any good word for us?
i'd say ln cm delta-p is off scale high.
roger. and how did the hatch integrity check go?
"well, we've just had it in tunnel vent all the - the way around the back side as i think you suggested."
"15, did you have a look at holding it in delta-p to see how the - see how it was holding on that?"
"no, we just left it in tunnel vent all the way around the back side. i - that's what we'd thought you'd said to do. we can check it now."
"15, why don't you bring it up to 3.5, and let us watch it for a while. i think we garbled some - and you watch it. i think we garbled something there."
"okay. our understanding was to let it go all the way, and then you get a good look out on this side. so we'll bring it up to 3.5."
"15, houston. two items; one, we want to make sure that you're aware that we cannot read the tunnel pressure, and so we're depending upon your read- outs of this delta-p to give us the confidence here in the hatch integrity. one other item that we do know, is that during all that period when the tunnel was vented, our 02 flow was off-scale low, which does give us some confidence in the integrity of the hatch. and, meanwhile, we're waiting for your ca on a 3.5 reading so we can begin a hatch integrity check. over."
roger.
mark. two minutes and 3.5 plus or minus 0.
roger. copy.
"and - and i think we had the same confidence, bob. we noticed the low 02 flow also. the only ques- tion we had was, why did the delta-p change?"
that's the same question that was bothering us.
"but, it's steady at 3.5, and has been now for about 2 and a half minutes."
copy.
"okay, 15. this is houston. we'd like to run that _. hatch integrity check to about 5 minutes total, because of what we suspect was the problem before. and, if it passes at that point, welll press on, per the flight plan, for following the normal steps. and you can plan, if we have time for it, we're looking for a jet at 179:30, at the present time. over."
"roger. 179:30, and we'll give you a call at the 5-minut e point."
thank you.
"okay, houston. there's 5 minutes at 3.5 and it looks solid. 07 ll ot 43 cc roger, dave. let's press on with a nominal time line."
roger.
"and, houston. are you happy with 3.5 or would you like to bleed it down a little more?"
"roger, dave. we're happy with the hatch integrity, and let's open the tunnel vent and bleed down to- wards _.0 at - for the nominal setup. and i guess it's on the decal there."
"roger. no, the decal says go for l0 minutes in lm tunnel vent."
"roger. and i guess that means after hatch integrity, which means beginning now."
"roger. step 7, and it's in work."
"15, houston. you're suit integrity check looks good as far as we can tell down here. 07 ll l? 48 c_p well, we had it for about 5 seconds there, and then the 02 flow went back up, so we'll hang on here and see if it comes back down. f_"
"roger. 07 11 21 _0 cmp okay, houston, 15. we got a good pressure integrity check. we're ready to press on. 07 11 21 _6 cc roger, we agree."
"and, 15, we're still aiming for 179:30 for jett. and be advised, of course, this means we're going to have to retarget p30 to 179:35. and, other than that, all attitudes will be the same. although, of course, since you'll be local vertical, your inertial attitudes for the burn will be slightly different than what you've seen."
"okay, understand. and your delta-p is off-scale high now."
roger. and you're 14 minutes past that time.
"houston, 15."
"go. - go ahead, 15."
"roger. understand. the retargeting on p30 - you want to target that for 179 plus 30 plus 00, and the same delta-vs as before?"
"negative, al. it's going to be 179 plus 35 plus 00 for the sep burn."
"sorry about that. i meant 179 plus 35. three zeros jett, huh?"
that's affirm.
"houston, 15."
"go. 15, go ahead."
roger. we're ready to turn the sequence arm on.
roger. you're go for turning them on.
"okay, and logic l, on; logic 2, on."
"and, 15, you're go for pyro arm."
roger.
"and, 15, we need direct rcs on, please."
okay. directs are on.
"and, 15, 3 minutes to je_i_, and we're wait - we're watching for pyro arm."
"okay. we're preceding through the pre-jett check- list at this time, and we'll get right to you. 07 ll b0 17 cmp and, it's away clean, houston. 07 ll bo 19 cc roger, copy. hope you let her go gently. she was a nice one."
"oh, she was at that."
"houston, 15. question on the separation maneuver. do you want us to burn the residuals in p41, or --- just make a 1-foot-per-second burn?"
"roger, dave, terry. burn them in p41, please."
roger.
"you understand that's burn the residuals, right?"
just - just making - just making sure.
"houston, p41 says 7/10ths forward."
"yes, 7/loths forward, 7/10ths up."
"roger, dave."
"and forward takes us right back to the lm. _-- 07 11 33 42 cc stand by, dave. we're looking into that, of course."
"okay, we got about a minute and 15 seconds or so."
roger.
"average g is on. -- 07 11 34 50 cc ah, hold the burn, dave."
"okay, we'll hold the burn."
"15, this is houston. we'd like to have visual reference relative to your position to the lm. we'd like you behind the lm. and, we'll give you a burn attitude for 5 minutes from now."
"roger. okay, i guess she's about 150 feet dead ahead."
"okay. copy, dave. thanks."
"and, dave. can you verify, were you behind, in local vertical, or body attitude coordinates?"
"well, give us a little while to figure that one out."
"roger. are you behind it in the orbit, or are you just - is it just sitting there in front of you as you look at it?"
"it's sitting in front of us when we sit there and look at it. 07 ll 38 41 c2_p bob, we're almost directly radially inward from the lm right now."
copy that.
"houston, our attitude is 150 degrees relative to the local horizontal."
"say that again, please, dave."
"roger. our attitude according to verb 83 down there is 150 degrees, relative to the local horizontal. which means we're - i guess, fairly close to local horizontal, at least within 30 degrees."
"stand by, _s. confusion still reigns, i think."
roger. understand.
"15, do you have an ordeal ball going at the moment?"
"sure do, and it's on the dsky; you can see it right down there."
thank you. tape 116/7
"roger, dave. we would like you to do a vfr burn, which means go - maneuver to a trailing position - and fire i foot per second retrograde. understand?"
that sounds like a good burn. roger. we'll do that.
"houston, 15. this ought to make for some interest- ing discussion, but i guess what you want us to do is point at him and burn aft to i foot per second; is that correct?"
"roger, dave. that's probably the best way to keep an eye on him."
"well, we're having a to_h time doing that, because he's right in the sun right now."
"but, houston, i think at this attitude of i foot _- per second aft will give us sufficient clearance. don 't you?"
"as long as you're trailing him, dave. i guess, right now, we can't give you any sound advice down here."
"okay, well, if we burn i foot per second on the local horizontal, which we are 81most on right now, i think that will put us in an orbit which re - remains clear from it."
"okay, houston. as far as trailing goes, right now as we look over the ground, we're leading him."
roger. that's our - -
we're about on a horizontal in front of him.
"roger. we need you behind him, dave. that - we were gradually coming to that conclusion. that was the only way you could have him in the sun. we need you behind him, and then a firing of retrograde."
"yes, that's going to take an awful lot. because --- we're a fair ways out now, and we'll have to maneuver quite a ways to get behind him. it'll take quite a while and a little bit of gas."
"roger, dave. understand that. stand by."
"okay, dave, how about 2 foot per second posigrade, as long as you're in front of him. understand? two foot per second posigrade."
"okay, so that'll be a minus x delta-v for 2 feet per second at our present attitude, right?"
"roger. that's affirm, dave."
okay. we're all on the same frequency. we'll do that.
"okay, houston. we put in 2 feet per second aft. and that was done just at local horizontal."
"roger, copy. thank you."
"and, 15; if you can anticipate, why don't you give me a call when you get yourself partially powered down from this. then we'll read you some flight plan updates, which are mostly just the deletion of activities so you can get to bed."
"okay, houston. appreciate that. thank you, and we'll call you back."
"15, houston. you got a moment for this update."
"just a minute, bob. 07 ll 56 06 i24p okay, bob. what changes do you have for us."
"okay. these will start out in the flight plan, here. and, after lm je%'2,we'd like you to proceed with the activities that run on the original flight plan from 177:30 through 178:01. so that last _ entry that we will be doing will be the line that says ""x-ray, on"" at the very top of that next page. after that - during that, though, we will delete at 177:53, the line that says ""mapping camera/laser experiment covers, open, talkbaek, barber pole, then, off, center."" it's the second line in the block at the bottom. you got that? 07 11 56 56 _ okay, understand. we'll delete that particular line, ""mapping camera/laser experiment, off,"" and we'll do all the activities up to - through 178 there, the mass spec x-ray, on."
"roger. and at the - on that same page, beginning at 178:20 to 178:30, we will scratch that particu- lar - that whole block of items. and going along with that, at 178:39, it says dac on, we will also scratch that. over."
"roger. understand. we will scratch the activities from 178:20 to 178:30. and, at 178:39, we'll scratch ""dac on"". how about the activity there at 178:317 we - guess we'll do that, huh?"
"roger. 178:31, that ""mass spec, multiple, low, discriminator, high: ion source, on"" will be done 30 minutes - three zero minutes after the mass spec experiment, on; ion source to standby, which is over there at 178:01. other words, we need a bo-minute delay between the top item on the left- hand column and the top item on the right-hand coll_."
"okay, we understand."
"okay, we'll delete the pan camera activities over on 179 hours. there's one at a hundred - 15, if you read - there's one item at 179:16, and another item at 179:21 that pertain to the pan camera. we will delete both of those. 07 11 59 02 i=mp okay, understand. delete the pan cameras at 179:18, and 179:21."
"roger. copy. and when you're ready to sleep, i - guess you can start with the systems checklist - presleep checklist at 179:31, there."
"okay, thank you, bob. 07 ll 59 2h cc and you noticed we didn't delete the eat period. 07 11 59 32 _ thar_k you."
"and - and, jim; do you guys want a tei-58 pad? 07 ll 59 52 _ okay. we'll take one."
okay. if you got - have you got the pad out?
"no, stand by."
give me a call.
okay.
"okay, jim. understand you have the pad. sps/g&n; 36363; plus 0.61, plus 0.93; 192:13:33.30; plus 2799.7, plus 0609.5, minus 0098.0; 181, ll2, 0.15. rest of the pad na. ullage: 4 jet, 12 seconds. over."
"understand. it's tei-84 sps/g&n; 36363; plus 0.61, plus 0.93; 192:13:33.30; plus 2799.7, plus 0609.5, minus 0098.0; 181, ll2, 015; 4 jets for 12 seconds."
"roger, jim. except it's tei-58. 07 12 o1 41 imp roger. it's 58."
"okay, jim. and, while we got you, - this is deke. i'd like to have you and dave, at least, take a seconal here before you go to sleep so you can really power down for the night. you g%vs need it. it's up to a1 whether he wants one or not."
"okay, thank you, deke. 07 12 02 06 ncc roger."
"15, houston; we have a correction to that update, if you'd get the flight plan back out please. 07 12 03 47 imp okay, go ahead."
"roger. that item 178:30, on the m-_s spec, the discriminator value there should be low. copy?"
"roger. understand, discriminator, low."
"thank you, jim."

"go ahead, 15."
"okay, we're just about getting bedded down here, bob. i wanted to check and clarify one thing with you before we did."
please do.
"okay, the flight plan updates that you gave to jim a little while - earlier included mass spec experiment, on and some switching with the dis- criminator and multiplier. now, as of yesterday, we had decided not to use the mass spec because of boom deploy problems. has somebody decided that we now should deploy the boom?"
"roger. my understanding is that we didn't want to do it before the plane change because we might have to jettison it and it's - now that we've got the plane change accomplished, we'll run it. and, if you have to jettison before tei, we'll do that. over. 07 lb 16 _9 cmp okay, i understand. i guess i didn't understand that yesterday; and, we'll go ahead and deploy it and get the mass - mass spec going now."
"roger, al. and one more thing; we'd like to make sure tonight that jim is on the ekg for the -- evening."
that's affirm. jim will stay on the biomed tonight.
"roger. and, one more thing, al, we would like to verify high gain antenna angles are pitch 25, yaw 185."
"right. that's what they're set on now, bob. 07 lb 17 28 cc okay. we had a long while picking you up. i guess we were a little worried, there."
"no, we just got our signals crossed in here. and, we had some different numbers on them before. so i got them. we're fixed up now."
"okay, and we'll be expecting you to be in vhf bistatic later on, right."
i guess - do you want us to go ahead and do that?
"yes, please, al."
okay.
"okay, one last little check is optics power is on. we'd like it off eventually. i expect you haven't gotten that far yet, al."
that's affirmative. we'll get it.
"okay, and otherwise you call us; we won't call you."
"okay, we'll call you. thank you, bob. good night."
good night.
"15, houston. over."
famous last words; go ahead.
"yes. how's that for broken promises. hey, r oso ? just came out of the woodwork and was worried because he doesn't have x-ray and g_mm, rays and all those on yet either. i'd assume you probably have - just haven't done any of that block, right?"
"yes. hey, bob, we're still trying to get cleaned up in here and get suits put away and all that sort of stuff. we'll get with it as soon as we can, but it's awfully cramped quarters and there's an awful lot of stuff to move around."
roger. we were afraid you'd get use to the luxury of all that space.
i kind of liked it here by myself.
this t_me i'll keep my promise.
okay. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription 07 14 29 -- begin lunar rev 54

"15, go ahead."
"is it time to get up yet, bob?"
"roger. we've got about 15 updates here for you, if you want to get ready in the sim bay."
thought we'd give you a crew status report and the onboard read-outs before we called it a night. i just w_nted to check and make sure we got every- thing turned on for you.
"roger. we'll get the guys looking at that - - f 07 14 55 50 cmp ... the mass spec out. okay, bob, we got the mass spec out, and i think we've cleaned up everything else for you for tonight, and i'll give you the readings here and then we'll call it a night."
"roger. we're listening, and i hope everybody else down here will be getting with me so we can give it to you at the end, if anybody wants anything. go ahead."
"okay. the prds, 25023, 23174, 08029."

"al, that should be bistatie vhf."
"that's correct, bob. the bistatie vhf radar test."
"and, can you think of anything else that needs to be done?"
"stand by, al."
okay.
"okay, three verifies for you, al. can you verify the gamma ray's out? the x-ray is ready? and we need a verify on jim for his ekg."
"okay, houston. he's not hooked up yet but will be shortly. and, we'll verify the gamma ray, out and on, and the x-ray, on."
thank you.
"and, al, we're working a state vector up-link for you. stand by a minute, and we'll get a decision on that."
"okay, rob, i guess we didn't have the gamma ray out, so it's going out now."
"roger. that's a verify, i guess."
and the x-ray is on.
thank you.
"okay, the x-ray is on. seems like we had quite a few loose ends tonight."
"and, al, how about a verify on x-ray covers, open?"
roger. that's verified. it's open.
thank you. we're still discussing the vector here.
okay.
"if you can give us p00 and accept, we'll have a load in about a minute. stand by, just accept - -"
okay.

do you want po0?
negative. accept only.
okay. i'll leave it p20.

"houston, 15. go ahead."
"roger. this isn't karl waking you up; but we don't show the mass spec experiment to on, and if the out - outgassing has been completed, we need the i0n source, on. over."
"okay. we've got it on, and it's been on for about 45 minutes now. and we now have multiplier, low, and discriminator, low."

"hello, houston; apollo 15."
"good morning, alfredo. this is houston."
"good morning, dr. joe. how are you?"
"couldn't be better, al. how's it going?"
"just fine, joe. you all talked out?"
"no, sir, just getting ready to start. and, pleased to have a chance to talk to you."
very- -
"i've got all kinds of things for you, al, when r you - -"
"very good, joe. glad to be tal_ing to you."
"okay, i've got all kinds of things for you, which i can start handing it up to you at your conven- ience, pretty much. we're going to change the flight plan around a little bit - primarily, lifting out things because of our getting a somewhat later start than normal, and a couple of other minor modifications. i also have a lot of news to read to you and some other good things you might be interested in. over."
"okay, joe. let's - why don't you give me a couple of minutes here to get some pens and the flight plan out and - and in about 5 or l0 minutes or so, i'll have the guys put the headsets on, and we'll all listen to the news. 08 00 46 bo cc al, out of curiosity, is everybody awake up there? 08 00 46 b7 cmp yes, man. 08 o0 46 b9 cc good morning, davy - - _ r"
"yes, joe, sure are. we're just in the middle of breakfast."
"hello, joe. how are you?"
"weli, i'm fine d.r.;-how are you today? 08 00 46 50 _ morning, joe."
"oh, we're in great shape. hey, you sure did a fine job for us down there, joe. jim and i'd like to really thank you. that was a superfine job of taking care of everything for us."
"i think the superfine job is the two of you; it was just most remarkable. everybody down here is still _:fl0ati_ng so high, they're havlng a hard time getting down to all that data you gave us. and, you'll be interested to know that - that we have sitting in front of us, a preliminary report from each eva of the geology of the area that i would say is more complete than our 90-day preliminary reports which -- were issued on some of our other landings. it's just most exciting."
"well, it's because you've got the real professional backroom there. those - those guys really know how to put - put it together. especially with the way they were coming up with the new ideas, while we were on the surface. that was really neat."
"and, dave, i do have to ask you one question. is there a three-unit segment of deep core stems some place in that command module? apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"joe, we wouldn't lose sight of that for all the tea in china. that's number i priority."
"yes, sir."
"oh, as a matter of fact, joe, we made a good thor- ough search of the lm before we let it go. we went from top to bottom to make sure we got everything, and i'm sure we got everything we brought up off the surface, and i'm pretty sure we did - did fairly well cleaning up the surface."
"okay, dave. good news; good news. al, if you're ready, i'll start hitting you with a few things we're interested in knowing from you right away. and then when we get those, i'll give you the gen- eral plan for the day. and i think, in some cases, we'll want to just talk you through some of the changes while you're m_king your front-side pass. there's no need to feed up all the data in detail to you at the beginning here. my first question: we need from you a configuration of panel 230, particularly - in fact, only really the mass spec switches, could you - call out the settings for the mass spec, experiment switch, ion source switch, multiplier switch, and discriminator switch, please."
"okay, joe, i'm right there. experiment is up and on. ion source is centered. the discriminator is low and the multiplier is low."
"okay, thank you. that's - that's what we'd guessed. and, al, i - i guess the first thing we want - we're going to want you to do today is to start to get ready to go plus-x forward, p20 option 5. we're _-- going to want you to retract the mass spec boom and close the x-ray and alpha particle cover."
"okay, joe. we'll do all that. how about putting it on a - on a time basis for me so i can write it in the flight plan. _ 08 o0 50 44 cc okay, real fine. you can start that right now at - just put it in at 192:52, i guess. and also, right after that, list fuel cell purge h20 dump and lioh canister change."
"okay, joe. understand. you want us to go ahead into plus-x p20 sim bay attitude, and pull in the mass spec and the gamm_ ray booms, and, i guess, turn off the mass - turn the mass spec to standby."
"al, let me hit you with that last statement again. we want you to retract the mass spectrometer boom, but not the gamma ray, and close the x-ray and alpha particle covers. retract mass spec boom and close two covers. over."
"okay, understand. you want us to pull in - to retract the mass spec boom and close the x-ray alpha covers, then do the fuel cell purge, the water dump and canister change."
that's affirm.
"okay, joe. i'll get that in work."
and one more item. you can start to charge bat b - at your convenience.
okay.
"okay, and looking downstream here, as soon as you get turned around, and these other good things done, we're going to ask you to open the x-ray and alpha particle covers. and for rev 60, the agenda calls for an eat period for you. and gamma ray, x-ray, and alpha particle data being taken during that time. sounds like you've got your eat period pretty well out of the way."
"yes, that's right, joe."
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, al."
"okay, joe. while we're maneuvered here to a plus-x forward, how about reading some news to us?"
"okay. sure will. let me - let me begin with just a note on that water dump. it'll take about 15 minutes to run, and they're interested in your dumping it to close to l0 percent onboard reading. over."
"roger, understand. probably the same as we've been doing before. we dump down to l0 percent, but not below l0 percent."
"that's correct. and i've got several things to read to you here. i have the official morning gold bugle zeitung report and - that comes from two rows behind me here. and i've also got a telegram for you, jim. and i have some history - a little bit of history that's been researched for you by the people at honeysuckle concerning a small problem with a leak on the endeavour about 200 years ago. and i'll start with whatever you'd like to hear first."
"okay, joe. go ahead."
"okay, let me just start with the morning's news. the weather report in houston-galveston area calls -- for showers and thundershowers through wednesday. today's temperatures will be in the lower 70s and upper 80s. 08 00 58 2_ cc the united states will support communist china's a_mission to the united nations this fall, secre- tary of state william rogers announced. the u.s. will also fight against expelling the nationalist chinese government on taiwan. u.s. steel, the in- dustry pace setter announced a price hike averaging 8 percent on virtually all its products and several other companies followed suit, as an aftermath of a new 3-year labor contract. trainmen won pay in- creases of nearly a dollar and a half an hour spread over a 42 months in a nationwide contract settle- ment, and called off their crippling strike against l0 railroads. the union yielded on the railroad's demands for some work-rule changes, yet to be worked - out. among those viewing apollo 15 activities, monday, in the mocr, was artist robert mccall, de- signer of the commemorative stamp for apollo 15. and just an edited note here: he was also making sketches of the scenes down here as he saw them and he would turn them out almost as fast as the photog- rapher would take pictures. that was most interest- / lng. turning to the sporting news, don wilson / pitched a two-hitter and jesus alou drove home the / winning run and then made a game-saving catch as i the houston astros downed the chicago cubs, 2 to 1. f_ and, apparently, rain is slowing up the oilers s preparations for the giants. the oilers - giant exhibition game is scheduled for monday night in the astrodome. and i've got the monday's baseball scoreboard - which i'll run through quickly for you baseball fans. in the american league: boston 7, baltimore 4; new york 7, cleveland 0; oakland 2, kansas city l; chicago 7, minnesota 5; detroit ll, washington 7; california 3, milwaukee 1. read back."

"roger, joe. copied all these off."
"roger. okay. in the national league: philadel- phia 4, atlanta 0; cincinnati 4, new york 2; st. louis 3, san diego 1; and los angeles 5, san fran- cisco 4. and lee trevino added another thousand bills to his bank roll, monday, by taking first place with the number - with a 7 under par, 65, in the columbus invitational pro-am. jack nicklaus and arnie palmer teamed last weekend to close in on trevino in professional golf's money-winning race, though. nicklaus and palmer won $20 thousand each when they won the national team championship at - i guess, ligonier, pennsylvania. trevino leads for the year with a total of nearly $200 thousand."
"and, i'll go over now to - jim, a special telegram for you which reads, essentially: mother, dad, and your brother charles are proud of you. we were thinking of our trip together on top of mount whitney and we are with you in spirit on the moon. love, mother, dad, and your crew. and i might add, that there - an occasional piece of mail for all of you that is starting - is starting to come in to the manned spacecraft center, here. in fact, i think a truck pulled up there yesterday to deliver some of the first."
"i'm going to go on, if you're still listening, to read some history that was sent to us by the honey- suckle people. and the subject is ""a leak on the endeavour at 62 hundred get."" following the above incident and the wonder from the apollo 15 crew whether captain cook's endeavour had ever sprung a leak, the staff at honeysuckle creek tracking station has searched the records and come up with ___ the following incident, which may be of interest. information has been extracted from an old news- paper article and an entry in captain cook's log book. ""it was ll p.m. on june ll, 1770, a clear moonlit night, when his majesty's ship, endeavour, under the command of captain james cook, sailed serenely under fully furled sail within the waters of the great barrier reef off australia's northeast coast. then disaster struck. the ship had got up- on the edge of a reef of coral rocks which lay to the northwest of sic having come in places sic run the ship 3 or 4 fathoms and in others about as m_ny feet."" (and i'm quoting james cook's diary here.) ""but about a hundred feet from her star- board side, she, laying with her head to the north- east, were 7, 8, and 10 fathoms."" with a grind and a roar, the endeavour rose in the bow, and came down hard. empty water. casks broke their lashings f and lay in a tangle with the rigging on the deck. the captain, clad only in drawers (which i guess is a constant wear garment) rushed on deck. he snmmoned all hands to the pumps, and ordered all unnecessary stores to be thrown overboard. such items as iron, and stone ballast from deep in the hole, casks, hoops, stays, oil jars, decayed store_, and then six cannons, which fired 4-point shot. (probably one cannon to fire long, one cannon to fire short and two to fire for effect.) these, in fact, are the cannons discovered in 1969, off the coast of northeastern australia by a team from the philadelphia academy of natural science. and, after restoration, one each was presented by the australian - to - by the australian government to the u.s., british, and to new zealand. the remain- ing three cannons are in australia. the original endeavour was finally freed from the reef by means _ of oakum and wool, wrapped in a sail, being sunk under the ship and plugged into the hole in hope that it would be sucked into the leak and would close the leak. the experiment was entirely suc- cessful and, i quote again, from cook's diary, ""in about a quarter of an hour to our great surprise, the ship was pumped dry and upon letting the pumps stand she was found to make very little water."" - subsequently, the endeavour arrived at the austra- lian mainland (the landing place is now called cooktown, by the way), and after two months the damage had been repaired and the ship returned to england. and that's the end of your history lesson for today. over."
"that's quite an analogy, isn't it?"
"quite an analogy, dave. certainly is. back to reality. al, i have a csm consumables update for you if you're interested in that. and let's see - the other item on my desk - well, i'll get to it a little later. i'll be standing by for your go ahead on the csm consl_mable update."
"okay, stand by, joe .... 08 o1 07 b6 cmp houston, 15. i'm ready to copy the consumables, joe."
"okay, alfredo. get 191 plus 25; rcs total, 47; quad a: 50, 47, 46, 47; h2 tank l: 56, 5b, 42; 02 tank l: 64, 67, 54."
"roger, understand, joe. at 191:25, rcs total, 47; quad a: 50, 47, 46, 47; h2 is 56, 5b, 42; 02 is 64, 67, 54."
"copy, al. and i'll be right back."
"okay, joe. 08 o1 09 b7 cc endeavour, this is houston again."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, al. let me lay some more words on you con- cerning your flight plan, when you're - you're ready to talk about that."
"roger, joe. go ahead."
"okay. you'll be in the configuration plus-x for- ward, and will be taking g_mma ray, x-ray, and alpha particle data, data during rev 60. we want you to do at 19b plus 45, a p52 option 3. and we're going to add a map and pan camera pass sometime during rev 60. and i'll be coming at you with the necessary data for that. also -"
"roger, joe; understand."
"okay, al. now i guess a - a word about biomed configuration, today. in order to get some very interesting base-line data, medical data on you, al - and, jim, for your eva coming up later - we're requesting that the two of you give us that biomed data today. i think, dave, you were scheduled for it, but i guess we'd prefer jim on the line with a1 to get base-line data for later. now, al, let - let me run through in just some blocks here the next revs as we see them, and the approximate activ- ities. and then i'll come up with specific data concerning those revs later on, perhaps actually during the revs. on rev 61, we're going to have the uv - -"
... that.
"okay. on rev 61 will be uv photography of the lunar mare. we're coming up on, i guess, an hour of light flash experiments, and it's pretty much dealer's choice between dave and jim, who - which- ever one of you would like to do that. rev 62 will be a crew exercise period, science photos, and science visuals. and we'll be taking the mapping camera and laser altimeter data during rev 62. and it will end with terminator photos. on rev 63, more m_pping camera, laser altimeter, and a burst of the pan camera. uv photos and terminator photos again. rev 64 will be eat period, boom photos, lioh canister change; and that brings us to about 204 hours, and it'll be time to go to bed again. over."
"okay, joe. understand in the flight plan that the object is going to be to get us back to the printed flight plan as much as possible. 08 01 lb 18 cc that's exactly right, al. and you'll be coming on to it kind of as the day progresses. we're just going to pick up a few quick items that we've missed over the past 2 hours and mainly just lift - lift out other sections, as i understand it. but you'll be back on the flight plan shortly. 08 o1 13 40 cnp okay, joe. fine. thank you."
roger. and - -
"and, joe, let me request that jim be - - 08 o1 lb 48 cc go ahead, dave. 08 o1 lb 51 cdr i'd like to say that i'd like to have jim without his sensors on today. that b, 4 days in a row is pretty tough with those things on. i think prob- ably, if you get him tonight, you could probably get your data, don't you think?"
"stand - stand by, dave, and i'll - let me double check."
"say, as a matter of fact, joe, why don't you give jim and a1 both a break today on the sensors, and i'll stick mine on, because i've had them off since we got back yesterday. and then if you want us _ have some particular data-gathering periods, why don't we take a look at that starting tonight, huh?"
"okay, dave. that sounds good."
"okay. and concerning the light flash things - jim and i both saw light flashes while we were on the surface, as a matter of fact."
"okay, copy that, dave. that's remarkable."
"good ship endeavour, this is houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. on our down-link data, we see indications of high gain antenna yaw fluctuations. wonder if you could glance over at your onboard indication and see if you see it there as well. and, also we're standing by for crew status reports, when you're ready to give it. 08 o1 21 b1 cdr no, we - we see no oscillations up here, joe. 08 01 21 b4 cc okay, thank you. 08 o1 22 b8 cc al, this is houston. with a tei-62 pad, when you're ready for that. we also have a question. how did the mass spec boom retraction go? and we've got a switch setting for your mass spec when you're ready."
"okay. jim will be ready to copy a tei pad here in a minute. and mass spec boom retracted without a /_ hitch this time, joe. sorry i didn't get the time on it, but it was very close to the nominal time, and apparently it didn't hang up this time."
"okay, fine, al. thank you. we'd like the - i guess the m_ss spec placed on standby, please. and that's the experiment switch."
"okay, mass spec on standby. yes, that's verified on standby, joe."
thank you.

"go ahead, al."
"joe, looking ahead a little bit in the flight plan, i see we've got gegenschein coming up on this rev. and i guess my question is do you want me to change the film in the - in the camera now? in other words, have we missed any picturetaking with the - the - the nikon that maybe we want to pick up with that mag before i offload that mag?"
"al, i'll have an answer for you in just a minute on that. in the meantime, could you reverify that the covers on the x-ray and alpha particle are open, and we're getting some problems on that, and i guess the best thing to do would be - to just go to your checklist, page 1-33, and do that cover, open, couple of steps - which is listed ""n_mber l, cover, open"" - -"
"okay, now, joe. you're right. i don't know - i don't know where we got - got our wires crossed, but the covers were closed and they're now open."
"okay, no problem. good."
"al, on your question on the gegenschein experiment, we want you to go ahead and change the mag to victor just per the flight plan."
"okay, joe. thank you."
"hello, al. this is houston."
"hello, houston. this is al."
"roger, babe. requesting you - give us a gainstep on the gamma experiment up three clicks, please. and, we're also wondering what mag you've taken of the nikon to put mag victor on. there's some confusion in our minds. i guess we thought victor was already on there. over."
"negative. mag u was on there before, joe, and i had just taken it off."

"okay, al, and you're now back on your flight plan except for the additional couple of pan camera bursts and a map camera pass that you already have copied down. and while i've got you on the line here, i'd like for you to think back yesterday, and i've got a question to ask concerning your suit f_ integrity check. we're trying to go through this and reconstruct exact/y what had happened. and i guess what we need is a - a comment about your third suit integrity check. and, that one was the one you did just after the first lm jett had been scrubbed and you went around the back side and did a suit integrity check, and we're wondering if you can re- call any of the details of that check for us. over."
"okay, understand you're concerned about the second suit integrity check we did. the third one was okay. the suits were - held integrity fine, and we had an 02 flow of about .6 to .7. so, i guess you're t-lking about the second one, huh?"
"daye, we're talking about the one you did before the lest one, whatever nigher you call that."
"yes, dick, that - that was the one we recycled quickly on board up here, and it was because we had one of the gloves that wasn't fastened on exactly right."
"roger, al. map camera and laser, off, please. 08 0b 35 02 cmp okay, map camera and laser, off. and, did you understand the comment on the suit integrity check?"
"fine, al. th,_w you. that helps us a lot."
okay.
"pan camera power, off, when convenient, please."
"okay, it's off."

mass spec discriminator to low.
"okay, thank you. and, did you get a volunteer for eye flash experiment?"
"yes, i think we have a volunteer for you."
okay.
"your volunteer's checking in here, joe."
"okay, jim. a quick word on it. everything per the flight plan. we are going to ask you to go ahead and give us your description real-time on the down link and your choice if you want to push to talk or go on to vox. and then, when you go around the corner, you can put it on the dse like you did before, in high bit rate. and al, we got a one-time-special good deal for you in the mean- time. we're coming up - you're going to be flying over the lm impact point shortly, where your trusty falcon augered into the moon, and we're going to ask for a short pan camera burst there. we'll come up with that photo pad to you in a minute. in the meantime, at your convenience, could you go to free, load noun 79 to .5 dead band, and - then go back, please."
"okay, we'll do that, joe. stand by. that ought to be good."
"and, endeavour, you will be interested to know that the impact of falcon was picked up on three beautiful seismometers on the moon - a really remarkable record. 08 05 00 53 _ which ones were they, joe?"
"apparently, they were the ones from apollo 12, apollo 14, and apollo 15. we haven't had reports from other seismometers yet. 08 05 01 09 _ that's very interesting. 08 05 01 14 cnp tell us, joe, did they get the lm impact close to where they wanted it?"
"roger. it went in to within about a degree. and in fact, as you know, it doesn't - the exact point isn't all that important. it - it went in just about where we wanted it, though. _"
"and al, as soon as you have noun 79 and you give us accept, we'll give you a state vector. over."
"okay, joe. you have it."
roger. we see it. thank you.
"okay, joe, i'm ready to start the - experiment."
"okay, jim, we're copying."
okay.
"endeavour, auto on high gain, please. 08 05 03 08 _ roger. auto."
"al, this is houston. you can go back into block. we still need a half a degree dead band. and you can delete two lines in your flight plan, one at 197:04 and one at 197:09, both the ""pan camera"" lines there, delete them. over."
"roger, joe. understand. delete the ""pan camera"" lines at 197:04 and 197:09."
"roger. you can block the ccmputer but we need a , half a degree dead band."
"roger, joe. i've loaded it a couple of times. let me check it again."
"okay, joe. i've got half a degree and - guess i'm having a hard time counting today."
"thank you, al. i'm not doing any better."
roger.
"joe, are you still there?"
"go ahead. 08 05 08 36 imp as long as i'm lying here waiting for a flash, i might cnmment that dave and i both observed the flashes while we were - on the surface. while we were in the bunks down there, we observed the flashes with the - oh, about the same frequency as we observed in orbit. one night there was about a 5-, 10-minute period there where i was awake, and i ran a little experiment by just turning over in the bunk. it seemed like the frequency was much less when i was lying on my stomach as opposed to lying on my back. it's just a note of interest. tape 127/_"
"okay, jim. that's a most interesting comment. and as you know, with about l0 minutes to go during the experiment today, we'll ask for you to turn over and be oriented with your face away from - the moon, and we might very well get the same sort of information this time. al, i've got a photo pad for you to copy when you're ready. and then, jim, you can just go ahead and switch to vox mode, if you don't want to push your push to talk while you transmit to us. your choice on that, though."

"okay, al. at this time, it's camera configuration for terminator photos that we missed a little earlier. and the lines should read ""cm4/el/250/ f vhbw, ivl, f/5.6 at 1/125th, infinity, six frames, mag romeo."" over."
"roger, joe. understand. terminator photo pad at 200 plus 20 is cm4/el/250/vhbw, and that's with the intervalometer, ivl, at f/5.6 1/125th, infinity, six frames an_mag r. 08 07 ll lb cc readback's correct, al. and, the next entry is at - 200 plus 25, which is open the map camera covers and extend the camera per page s 1-39. and, at that time, map camera, image motion to on. and then, coming up to the time 200 plus 27 plus 56, el on; and 200 plus 29 plus 36, el off. at the time 200 plus 30 plus 36, map camera, on; image motion, increase; talkback to barber pole, plus four steps; laser altimeter to on; pan camera mode to standby, power, on; stereo, exposure, normal. over. 08 07 lb 06 cmp roger, joe. at 200 plus 25 open mapping camera covers and extend the mapping camera. turn the image motion on at 275 - 200:27:56, el on, and at 29:36, el off. at 30:36 mapping camera, on; image motion to barber pole, plus four; and laser on. and then pan camera, standby, power, on; stereo, exposure, normal."
"that's correct al. and continuing on through a few more steps here, and i'll read them all, and then stand by for your readback. 200 plus 33 plus 29, pan camera, mode to operate. 200 plus 49 plus 32, pan camera to mono. 200 plus 54 plus 27, pan camera, stereo. 200 plus 59 plus 22; pan camera, mode; standby; pan camera, power to off, on msfn cue. and, moving right along, 201 plus 17 plus 00, pan camera, image motion, increase. i'm sorry, al. that was misread. that should be map camera, image motion to increase; talkback, barber pole. 201 plus 28 plus 21, el on. 201 plus 30 plus o1, el off. 201 plus 30 plus 21, map camera, off; laser altimeter, off. and the final one, 201 plus 32 plus 00, retract camera and close covers per the page in your checklist. over."

"okay, al. and read back to me four more lines, beginning with 200 plus 33 plus 29. you didn't go back quite far enough, and that - that one should read pan camera, mode to operate."
"oh, okay. 08 0y 17 25 cc and i'm standing by."

"okay, al. sounds real good. but doublecheck for me one line, which i may have goofed. it's the 201 plus 30 plus 21, map camera, off; laser altimeter; off."
"roger, joe. understand. at 201:30:21. that's 20 seconds after el, off, we get the mapping camera, off and the laser, off. · z"
"yes sir, that's affirmative. and, i guess - we're still waiting for an isa weight. other than that, we're doing real fine. _ 08 07 18 47 cmp okay, joe."
"houston, 15."
"go. go ahead, al. and, we're waiting for a image motion talkback to barber pole."
okay. dave's going to get the isa weight out for you and call you.
"okay. if he's able to weigh it right there, i'd like to know how he's going to do it. i assume he's got it written down, though."
he's got it written down. he just has to get it out.
houston. this is 15.
"go ahead, 15. 08 07 22 56 _ yes, joe. i have weight information on the isa. the isa total was 64 pounds, which includes bags 4 and 6, and 8 pounds return items. and the isa, by itself, without anything loaded in it, was 8 pounds. over."
"okay, jim, copied that. sounds like there might be a stone or two in there."
"yes. bags 4 and 6, for sure."
"thank you, jim."
"apollo 15. we'd like gamma ray shield, on, please."
"roger, dr. parker. shield, on."
"and, 15. time to start the terminator now."
roger.
"mapping camera, standby, please. 08 07 32 lb cdr roger. standby."
"laser altimeter, off, please."
"apollo 15, houston. if you have a chance, we'd like to t_lk to dave and jim about this lcg con- nector problem sometime. 08 07 b4 37 cdr okay, stand by."
"and auto on high gain, please."
auto.
"houston, 15. go. 08 07 b5 09 cc 15. two questions we'd like to ask. first one's specific, and that is, if you noticed anything about the connector between the lcg and the suit when you took it out in order to put the plugs in yesterday afternoon. was it already out? was it loose? was it not lock - locked? or what? and secondly, a general question building up from this. can you tell us anything - any insights you ac- quired in taking the suits off and looking at the connector or just, in general, about what this problem may have been caused by?"
"well, i guess - i guess our first indication was lack of a good integrity check. as a matter of fact, we couldn't get much more than about a pound in the suit. and the first - in thinking it over, we - we thought the only thing it could be would be those connectors, because that was the on - only semiopen port, even though it shouldn't - shouldn't be leaking. and, everybody checked their helmet and gloves and they appeared to be locked, so we broke open the helmet and gloves and jim reached in through my zipper and pulled out the lcg connector and stuck in the plug. and -- then we rezipped, or i did. jim rezipped me. and we tried another integrity check, and it _:_ worked okay. i guess beyond that - i don't have any explanation for it, other than the only pos- sibility is that the lcg connector was leaking, or that somebody's glove or helmet was leaking, be- cause the suits have been, as you know, very tight all the way through."
"roger. did jim notice when you - when jim took out your connector there, to put the plug in, did he notice it as being loose, unattached, or _ not lock-locked? did he have any - could he tell any of that just reaching in with his fingers?"
"bob, this is jim. the lock-lock was engaged on that water connector on dave's suit."
"okay, copy. and do we understand that dave's suit was the only one that did not pass the integrity check that first time around?"
"no. you can't isolate it. the whole suit circuit is the integrity check. it's spacecraft plus three suits. so, there's no way to tell."
"roger. but on - what i mean is that you did not put - did you put plugs in jim's suit, too, or just in dave's suit? 08 07 37 50 _ no, only - only in one suit. but we did go through the operation of taking off helmets and gloves, which also may have been the problem."
roger. copy that.
"in - in other words, there may have - even though we checked the lock-locks on the helmets and gloves, why, somebody could have had a cocked one and - and missed it. these - es - especially the - the surface equipment was - had an - an awful lot of lunar dust on it, and it was sort of hard to work. we're - we're going to get them cleaned up before the eva, but after three runs down there, why, the connectors were getting pretty tough to work, even though we did lubricate them."
"roger. copy. i don't think we have anything else, dave. we noticed you did seem to have some trouble getting a suit integrity check the second time around, also. is that right?"
yes. there was a glove that wasn't locked.
"okay, guess that was c_ the loop. thanks."
"i think the suit circuit's tight. i think that just might have been one of those things, because the last one we ran was real good. it - the flow dropped down to like, 6 or 7/10ths, i guess, and it would have stayed there all day long. i think we've got a good suit loop, but - i'm not worried about that at all. just a matter of getting all the connectors cleaned up so they all work well. and insuring that everybody gets a good lock-lock."
"roger, dave. we agree too. i - it seems to us that that sounds like it was just one of those situations we run a suit integrity check for."
roger. that's exactly right.
"and, 15; houston. you are go for los."
"thank you very much, houston. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription 08 08 12 -- begin lunar rev 63"
"endeavour, this is houston. over."
"hello, houston; this is endeavour."
"roger. we got the usual flight plan updates, if you'll get a flight plan out and copy them in, please. 08 08 46 37 cnp okay; stand by 1."
"okay; and if someone could give us high gain antenna to auto, we'd appreciate it."
go ahead with the update.
okay. first o_e is the uv photo plan - pad at 201:05 in the flight plan. the t-start for that will be 201:ll:19. over.
understand. uv t-start: 201:ll:19.
"roger. next, at 201:20, we will delete ""pcm cable."""
okay; got that.
"roger. at 202:30, it's discriminator, low, in that line on the mass spec."
"okay. discriminator, low, at 202:30."
"roger. at 203:21, we will delete ""laser altimeter, off."""
"understand. delete ""laser altimeter, off"" at 203:21, and let's hold up on the rest for now."
"and 15, 30 seconds to pan camera, mono."
"hey, go with the rest of the updates, bob."
"okay. at 203:23, we'll delete the '_apping camera track, retract, talkback barber pole, 4 minutes, gray then off (center )""; that whole line."
okay; that's deleted. next?
"and we want pan camera, mono, please."
it's there.
roger; sorry.
"okay; 203:27, we'll delete ""mapping camera/laser experiment covers, closed, talkback barber pole, gray, then off (center)""; et cetera. that whole line there. 203:27."
okay. next?
"okay; now we have here a little test the guys down here would like to run with the laser to see if we can zap it a little bit and rejuvenate it, perhaps. the first step is back on 201:30. we will delete the ""laser altimeter, off"" and '_apping cover/laser altimeter cover, close."" at 201 plus 30. over."
are you making an update to the update?
stand by here. stand by a minute.
okay; i didn't exactly find that one.
"yes, stand by. i got to check with oso."
"okay, 15. we got a clarification on that. the ""laser altimeter, off"" is at 201:30. the ""mapping camera/laser altimeter cover, close"" is called out at 201:32. and we want to delete both of those."
"stand by, bob. we're taking pictures. we'll come back to you."
"yes, give me a call."
"and 30 seconds to pan camera, stereo."
"okay, houston; 15. go ahead with some updates, if you've got them."
"okay, al. did you copy? what we're doing is we're changing that update, deleting the laser altimeter, off at 201:30. and then, we're also deleting at 201:32, the callout to ""close the mapping camera/ laser altimeter covers."" over."
"okay; i understand. at 201:30, you want the laser altimeter left on, and the mapping camera left out and the covers, open."
that's affirmative. okay; now after the mappino - -
is that what you want?
"that's affirmative. and now, after the mapping camera is off at 201:30, we want to cycle the laser switch off for i second, then on for 15 sec- onds, off for i second, on for 15 seconds, et cetera, for 20 cycles. and after 20 cycles, we will leave the laser altimeter, on, for mefn analysis. over. 08 08 57 08 cml okay; understand. you want at 201:30 - you want to cycle the laser altimeter, off for i second and on 15 seconds, for 20 seconds - for 20 cycles, and then leave it turned on."
that's roger. and we'll get back to you at that point.
okay.
"and that's all we have for right now, al."
roger.
"and, al, 30 seconds to pan camera, standby, power, off."
"and, 15, we verify the pan camera lens is stowed. when convenient, we 'd like battery b charge - battery bravo charge terminated."
"understand, b terminated."
"and, endeavour; houston. one more request, please."
"go ahead, bob."
"roger. since we don't have the pcm cable, we'd like to - for these uv photos - to have you give us a mark each time you press the shutter button, please, on the air-to-ground."
okay; if you'd like.
"houston, 15."
"go ahead. go ahead, 15."
"okay, bob. would you like me to hook up the pcm cable to it?"
"well, the word that i was given down here was that you couldn't reach with the pcm cable."
"no, we're taking - we're taking the pictures out of window 5, and that's where the scientific in- strument outlet is."
"stand by. 15, if you can do that, that's fine."
"okay; i'll tell you what, bob. i'll go ahead and hook up the pcm cable, and - and you tell me if you're getting a signal down there after i start taking pictures."
okay.
and the word you got on it was - was correct. it looks like window 5 is about the only window that can be used for the pcm cable.
roger.
"and, endeavour, we won't be able to see that pcm real time, but we 'll just assume that it's coming down if you've got the pcm cable hooked up."
"okay, bob. i got it hooked up."
thirty seconds to uv photos.
okay; thank you.
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, bob. when i took the - the shade out of window 5, window 5 still appears very clean."
copy.
"and, endeavour, two questions if you've got a chance, between now and terminator photo."
"say again on the terminator photos, bob."
"roger. do you have time for a couple of questions, between now and the start of the terminator photos? _ 08 09 19 34 cmp yes, sure. go ahead."
"roger. first, any comments on the mass spec boom retraction you did a half hour ago?"
"no, no comments on it. and - i guess we're back to the position we were in before, that the thing is sort of half barber pole. and when i go back out with it - fiddle with it a little bit, the barber pole goes full up and then comes down about half-way again."
okay; we copy.
and that's where it stands right now.
okay. second question - -
"i played with it for a while, and then got busy in other things. but i'll continue - i'll continue working on it."
"copy, al. second question, do you want me to con- tinue giving the - you these real-time marks on air - air-to-ground, just before and after various camera passes? tape1bo/6"
"yes, i like the reminder, bob."
okay; 30 seconds - -
"don't expect an answer, i'll probably be busy doing it."
hopefully. thirty seconds a good time?
roger.
"and, houston; 15."
"go ahead. 15, go ahead."
"okay; for your info, the mass spec took about - oh, maybe seven or eight cycles this time, before it came all the way in. and the same operation as before."
roger; copy. it took you seven or eight cycles to get it all the way in.
thirty seconds; the terminator photo start.
terminator photo stop.
"roger, bob."
"mapping camera, off. ·"
"and, endeavour; houston. be advised, we'd like _ accurate 15 seconds, on; i second, off. no more than 16 or 17 seconds, on."
roger; understand.
"and, 15. roger; thank you. unfortunately, like _ everything else, the laser didn't do much good. we'd like now, mapping camera to standby; laser alti_'i'er, off. then, we'll do the retract and door, close. over."
"okay_ bob. we'll go mapping camera, off and laser, off."
"we need mapping camera, standby, please."
"roger; standby, and image motion, off, and laser altimeter, off. and retracting the - retracting the camera, now."
copy.
"and, endeavour; houston. over."
go ahead.
"roger, al. if you could get us a film-budget status on the backside to give us when you come around, we'd appreciate it. and except for that, you' re go for los."
"all righty. thank you, sir. and we'll see if we can conjure one up for you. f-"

"houston, endeavour, go."
"roger, if you ... roger, if you guys give us an accept, we'll send you up a state vector and time up-link."
"roger, you've got it."
"copy. and if you fellows will give me a call in the middle of your eating there, when you've got time, we'll do some talking at you."
"okay, give us about 5 minutes here."
okay. f-
"and 15, its your computer. over. 08 l0 4b 23 cdr roger."
"houston, endeavour. we're ready to chitty-chat, if you like."
"okay. while you guys are eating your supper there, it might be _ good time to get a report on your food so far. how's it been going?"
"oh, i think we have consumed every meal as planned and we've made a pretty good cut into the pantry."
"you've made a pretty good cut into the pantry, you say? _- 08 l0 44 17 cdr roger. that extra little box over there with extra little goodies."
"okay, and can you gb_s give us any estimates on the water that you and jim consumed on the surface, say in the lm and on the eva, and any differences between this and what al's been consuming? tap_! 131/2 p_'_g'1:300 08 0 44 39 cdr not without sitting down and doing some thinking about it. we'll be glad to do that, if you like."
"roger. if that's not too much trouble, i guess we could start out by some estimate as to how much you guys were drinking in the lm and on the eva. was the drink bag adequate, or what?"
"oh, i think that is probably a good discussion for the debriefing after the flight."
"okay. sounds like you are at least eating and drinking a lot so far. we are anxious for you all to continue eating and drinking well, because of the eva yet to come."
"oh, okay. well, if that's your - your interest, yes, we - we consumed quite a bit of water on the surface, and we were quite satisfied with what we had. we had plenty. and we've been eating and drinking a lot up here. i think everybody is in fine shape and ready to take care of what is on - on the flight plan the rest of the way."
"sounds good. one other specific point we'd like to clear up, dave, which i guess was a little muddled this morning. did you and jim take a seconal last night or not?"
"no, there's been no medication taken by anybody on the flight."
"okay. however, i - we down here would like to recommend for all three of you to take one tonight just to make sure we get another good night's sleep."
i think that's unnecessary.
"well, that's our recommendation anyway. and can you tell us who plans to sensor up tonight, dave. -"
"okay. roger. i guess as per our agreement this morning, why - you'll get a cmp and an i24ptonight."
"roger; understand. and then we'll press on with the normal flight plan tomorrow. and, al, we'd like to have you - you wear the lightweight headset tonight, because then, we'd like to wake just a1 up on schedule so he can do us a p20 to - give us some plus-x time on the mass spec. and so we'd like to - arrange it that way, if 'its conven- ient with you guys."
"no, i don't think that's practical, bob. you can't have one person awake in here and the other two sleeping. it - just can't do it."
"okay; understand. and to avoid what we had last night with all those last minute calls again and again and again, why don't you guys give us a final call just before you're ready to go to sleep. we'll get a final status down here, and then we won't - we won't have to keep calling back tonight."
"oh, that's a good idea. all right. we'll do that."
it got a little embarrassing down here after a while.
"oh aw, that's okay. yesterday was a long day."
"roge_ that. and we got a tei 69 pad down here, when jim's ready to copy. and we're also ready to copy some torquing angles from that p52, if you got them. and we'd like you to leave your high gain antenna at plus 25 and 185 on yaw and in narrow and reacquire as you go around the corner this time."
"oh, okay. you want narrow, reacquire, and plus 25 and 185. we'll do that. if you're ready to copy, i've got the p52."
roger. i'll copy that now.
"okay. noun 05 was .01; noun 93 was plus.07, minus .47, minus .05. they were torqued out at 202:00:30."
"roger. copy .o1, plus .07, minus .47, minus .05, and 202:00:30."
roger. that's cricket.
"and, dave, we'd like optic, zero, at this time, piease."
"oh, yes, optic, zero. hey, by the way, i - i should have said .007. pardon me. i had n_f decimal point in the wrong spot."
understand .007. and was the - -
"just - just put a zero in front of all - the three torquing numbers. the - the platform is too good, and the numbers are so small, we - we're not even thinking in three digits anymore."
"okay. we got 007, 047, and 005. understand."
that's correct.
"okay, bob. i'm ready to copy the pad."
"okay, jim. it's tei 69, sps/g&n; plus 36245, plus 0.61, plus 0.92; 213:51:51.04; plus 2803.1, minus 0465.4, minus 0099.6; 179, 132, 353. the rest of the pad is na. ullage; four jets, 12 seconds. over."

"you've got a loud squeal there, jim, but i can probably read you."

"roger, jim; copy. good readback. and, endeavour, that's all we've got for you right now, until you give us a presleep call, except for standing by for a film budget report from al."
"houston, 15."
"go. go, 15."
"okay, bob. i got that film thing compiled for you, if you want to copy."
"copying. 08 10 52 32 cmp okay. i will read you frames expended, magazine ___ nectar 76, oscar 58, romeo 55, victor 12. and i haven't used anything out of s or - and l is running right now on the mass spec."

"okay, bobby. love to have you do that."
"and, endeavour; houston. we'd like pan camera, standby."
"okay, bob. roger on the standby."
"houston, the pan camera was on standby."
"say again, 15."

okay. coming down.
thank you.

"and, endeavour; houston. we ... at the los in about 2 minutes. everything looks in configura- tion for sleep. we'd like to verify the oxygen heaters are auto, auto, off. except for that, you are go for sleep and go for los."
"okay; understand. and we're fixing to give you the presleep checklist, there. and we had a little unscheduled maintenance on our friendly water valve again. so we'll be about l0 more minutes, but it's under control. same - same problem we had before."
roger. and understand it's under control.
"yes, it's just - just the same thing worked loose again, and we 're fixing it now."
"roger. we copy. you guys didn't strike a coral -- reef there, did you?"
"(laughter) no, i don't think so."

"roger. and, while you've got the flight plan there, the only update that concerns us for the next hour and a half - is to - over there at 21:54, delete mrnual - ""manually roll clockwise."" you got that one? 08 19 30 56 cml yes. roger."
"and everything after that, all the way down to 212 plus 20. and then we'll be in contact with you again for further updates."
"okay. understand. that block between 21:54 - or 2 - 211 plus 54 and 212 plus 20, that - that all goes as - as scheduled."
entire thing deleted. roger.
roger. then we'll be in p20 attitude and standing by for your word when we get contact again then.
"okay, al. the computer's yours."
roger. understand.
"al, would you do a verb 66 for us?"
roger. you got it.
"al, we need the  the tlm switch in block, please."
"roger, karl."
"15, if you'd like a quick consumables update, i can give it to you now or i could wait until the next rev. x"
"go s//ead, karl. if there's time, i'll copy it now."
"roger. the time is 211 plus 00; rcs total, _6; quads: alfa, 48; baker, 45; charlie, 44; delta, _6; hydrogen tanks: 49, 47, 39; oxygen tanks: 61, 64, 48."

"hi, houston; 15. loud and clear. how - us?"
"hi, dave. you're coming through loud and clear. how did our consumables update get to you, okay?"
okay. we got everything but the oxygen.
okay. want me to read those three up_
okay. go ahead.
"roger. oxygen tanks at that same time that i gave you originally were 61, 64, 48."
"okay, 61, 64, and 48. and i have a p52 for you and a crew status report."
fire away with them.
"okay. the p52: noun 05 was .01; noun 93 was plus .029, minus .025, plus .018; was torqued out at 211:52:00."
roger.
"and if you still have your pencil handy, why, the sleep came out to 7, 7 and a quarter, and 7. and the prds: 25026, 23182, and 08033. and go ahead with your updates."
"roger. okay. flight plan updates for the coming rev and -there's several of them here. and just to keep you feeling a little bit more optimistic, on the following revs, there are very few updates. okay. at 212:40, we want to delete map camera image motion, increase. at 2 - -"
"roger. got the deletion at 212:40. go. _-_ 08 20 30 59 cc roger. at 213 plus 24, we want to delete the gamma ray, boom, deploy. and at that - there are 3 - -"
213:24. have the deletion.
"roger. and just below that, the msfn verify len - lens tuck in and also the pan camera power, off, delete both of those."
roger. copy the next two deletions also. go.
"at 214 plus 02. we want to change that camera configuration to the 250-millimeter lens, 250. the f-stop should be 5.6; the exposure time should be i over 125."
"roger. 214:02. camera configuration: 250 milli- meter lens, f/5.6 at ll 22 ?. go."
"correct. at 214 plus 06, and mass spectrometer, ion source, off; experiment, standby. and at the same time, add logic power to deploy/retract."
"roger. at 214:06, mass spec, ion, off; experiment _ standby; logic power to deploy/retract. go."
"roger. at 214 plus ll, if ion source, off, 5 min- utes; mass spectrometer, boom, retract. 08 20 33 lb cc 15, we'd like high gain, auto."
"okay. at 214:11, if ion, off, for 5 minutes; mass spec, boom, retract. go."
"at 214 plus 12, we add mapping camera/laser, experiment covers, open; mapping camera, track extend; mapping camera, image motion, on."
"okay. 214:12, map/laser experiment, open; map track, extend; and image motion, on."
"roger. at 214 plus 16, we change the el on to _ t-stop minus 140 to t-start 140. simply change stop to start."
roger. stop to start. go.
"and at 214 plus 17, again change stop to start. and at that time, also, add laser altimeter, on."
"okay. 214:17, stop to start and laser altimeter, on. go."
"and at 214 plus 18, change mapping camera on off to mapping camer on on. in other words, change off to on; add parenthesis t-start. delete the next line, mapping camera - delete mapping camera, on to standby. and the third line, change mapping camera, image motion, off, to mapping camera, image motion, increase. barber pole plus four steps/on."
"okay. 214:18, map camera, image motion, increase; barber pole plus four steps/on."
"roger. and did you get the mapping camera - mapping camera, on, on t-start?"
"oh, roger. map camera, on,on t-start, and scratch the map camera, on to standby. _ 08 20 36 14 cc roger. that takes care of ali the - ail the updates required for the next rev."
roger. understand. thank you.
"15, this is houston. a couple of comments, and then a - one change in your g&c checklist. the comments are as follows. as you will note from the consumables update, we now have single-tank capabil- ity at the 40-amp level. and, concerning the mass spectrometer boom problem, it appears to us that this is temperature-associated problem. and the next time you retract the mass spectrometer boom, we suggest that you retract it only once for 4 minutes, and if it hasn't gone gray, just leave it there. there is no need to go in and out until it turns gray. that won't be a critical problem until we come closer to a burn. f"
okay-. i understand. just retract it for 4 minutes and leave it there. okay?
that's right. and has somebody got a g&c checklist there on page 9-4?
okay. stand by. we'll pull it out.
ail right. i've got page 9-4. go ahead.
"ail right. we'd like to correct one of the short -- burn constants, and it's in coll_mn d, row 5. the number should be changed from i - 01605 - it should be changed to 01614."
say again the location.
"it's column delta, row 5."
"okay. i've got it now. i'm sorry. i thought you said b, bravo. how about reading the number again, pleas e."
roger. the correct number is 01614.
okay. 01614 by 01605.
that's correct.
"and whenever somebody tells me he's ready to stop breakfast and copy a pad, i have tei-71 and also a mapping camera photo pad."
"all right. stand by l, please. probably be a couple minutes."
righto.
"okay, karl. i'm ready to copy the tei pad."
"roger, jim. good morning. tei-71, sps/g&n. the weight is not applicable. p trim: noun 48 is plus 0.64, plus 0.98; 217:49:18.04; plus 2838.6, minus 0581.0, minus 0027.7; 178, 129, 351; the rest is na. four jet ullage for 12 seconds. and that 's all."

"roger, j - roger, jim. and would you repeat the - the yaw trim."
"yaw trim was plus 0.98. , page 1315"
that's all correct. thank you. and the last bit of information i have down here is a mapping camera photo pad. at 214 plus - -
okay. go ahead.
"roger. it's at 214 plus 20 in your flight plan, and there is no slot for it. you'll just have to stick it in. mapping camera, start, 214:20:03; stop, 215:19:49. 08 20 46 43 _ copy 214:20:03 and 215:19:49."
that's correct.
"15, this is houston with just a passing comment to dave. we have lee silvers and jim head in the back room- available for any questions or comments concerning the lunar surface activities that you'd like to make. is there anything on your mind you'd like to discuss with them?"
"well, it shouldn't take more than about a couple of weeks, i guess, if we started now. i guess we got a lot to discuss with them. we've talked it over a little bit, and we've come to some con- clusions about rilles and mountains and those sort of things. and i - i guess, rather than get into the details now, we probably ought to wait until the debriefing. if they have any questions for us, we'd be happy to answer."
"okay. it's my understanding that they didn't - you - you gave them so much data they didn't really have any questions left. but stand by, i'll see if they - if they come up with some after you've invited them to. joe says, hey, they just might have - -"
okay.
- - something. so stand by.
"yes. that's right. i've never seen the day yet when those two didn't have some questions. _-_ 08 20 49 47 cc you opened yourself up there, dave."
"yes, that's good. we're ready."
"15, this is houston."
"go ahead, karl."
"lee and jim are sitting right beside me here; and their comment is they - they don't really want to ask very many questions and perturb the debriefing a week from now. but they do just have a couple. and the first one - the first one concerns a unique crater close to scarp that you described as having about a 40-meter diameter, with a very soft rim. and the texture of the material in it was - instead of being fine angular fragments, was more in the form of clods. they'd like to know a little bit more, if - if possible, about its location relative to scarp, and any other comments you can make about the unique - the particular uniqueness of this crater."
okay. stand by 1.
"okay, houston. i guess our answer to that is that we had interpreted that particular crater as being scarp. perhaps it wasn't. perhaps we were near scarp and that was a somewhat smaller crater. but, i guess, as we remember it, that was the one we had called scarp, and it was, i believe, the only crater we really sampled as we approached rim crater in the terrace there. and that particular crater had very soft rims - extremely soft, and all the frag- ments - the apparent fragments were very frangible. they just fell apart like dirt clods. and we did sample some, and we had a discussion i think at the time, and - and i guess we still don't exactly agree relative to the amount of glass that was present in the fragments. jim seems to think there was a fair amount, and i - i don't remember any in __ particular. but it was a fairly uniform crater. and all the debris around the crater - as i remem- ber, there was something like 20 percent or so of angular frags - all of it apparently would break apart very easy. and there were no solid fragments that we could see or distinguish. of course, every- thing is covered by dust. and we did sample some. and i guess that's about the size - the size of it. is there anything more specific you'd be interested in_"
"dave, this particular crater sounds more and more interesting to the people down here. and i guess _-_ the next question is what - was there anything about the crater, its shape or anything else, that would lead you to think it had a different origin than most of the other impact craters?"
"no, it - its depth-to-diameter ratio was about par for the - for the course up there. and it had a slightly raised rim, and the rim may have been somewhat higher than - than others. but i wouldn't be able to distinguish that specifically. it - it was a rather standard-appearing crater, until we walked up onto the rim, and it was extremely soft. and, of course, we only sampled one edge of the rim there. we didn't get any circumferential sampling on it. so it might have been a - a unique part. but it looked pretty uniform all the way around. _-_ 08 20 59 21 cc roger."
"and we did get the appropriate photographs plus a pan at that site, which, i think, when we go over during the debriefing - perhaps we can extract some more of what we saw. as you remember, at that particular time, we were pretty well hustling, and we didn't have a chance to do much looking at the maps as we got there."
they say that's great. thanks a lot.
okay. anything else?
"hey, dave. you've done a lovely job. you just don't know how we're jumping up and down, down here."
"well, that's because i happened to have had a very good professor."
"a whole bunch of them, dave."
"that's right. as a matter of fact, so many of them, it's just hard to - hard to remember it all. but we sure appreciate all you all did for us in getting us ready for this thing. and i'll tell you, i think jim and i both felt quite comfortable when we got there, about looking around and - and seeing things. i just wish we had had more time, because, believe me, there is an awful lot to be seen and done up there."
yes. we think you defined the first site to be revisited on the moon.
"well, as we go around in lunar orbit here, i can look down - and i could just spend weeks and weeks looking. and i can pick out any number of superb sites down there which would take you several weeks to analyze on the surface. there is just so much here. to coin a phrase, it's mind boggling."
"beautiful, dave. thank you so much."
"yes, sir. and i hope someday we eau get you all up here too. i - i think we really need to have some good professional geologists up here. as a matter of fact, good professional scientists of all disciplines, not only in lunar orbit, but right on the surface, because you all would just really have a field day, where - with your back- grounds and what you know. there's just so much to be gained up here."
"great, dave. thanks a lot."

"stand by 1, karl."
"okay, houston; 15. we're ready for the news."
"roger, 15. the flight of apollo 15 is still front- page news around the world. even yesterday's rela- tively quiet activities were noted by most news media. the rail strike with the united transpor- tation union has ended, and 10 railroads that were out of operation for 18 days are back on the tracks. growers in california were hardest hit by the strike, losing an estimated 45 million dollars in sales and related industries. president nixon has asked congress not to allow the use of federal funds to pay for busing school children. the administration _'_ also announced that it is appealing a bench mark court ruling against massive busing in the public - in the public schools of austin, texas. treasury secretary john b. connally is attempting to stop a rumored increase in bank interest rates. connally said he is distressed to hear reports that bank prime lending rates are to be raised again. rates were increased only last month. new york stock exchange prices fell yesterday in the second largest decline of the year, with the dow jones industrial average dropping almost 15 points. analysts say that the decline may have been caused by the rumored increase in interest rates. you got up too early to hear much news of last night's baseball games, but we can report that the astros lost to the cubs 5 to nothing. they did better monday night, when they beat the cubs 2 to 1. the weather report from the houston area is one word: soggy. rain has fallen -_ off and on for more than 24 hours, and there was a long steady rain most of yesterday afternoon. going to be a lot of grass cutting to do when you get back down here, guys."
"oh, yes; but we sure got nice sunny weather up here."
"no clouds up there, huh? that's amazing."
no. it's just clear as crystal.
"thinking about all that sunshine up there rem_nds me that we're in a bind down here about your expo- -_ sure to uv, and we recommend that, on the several times on the next couple of orbits when you're re- quested to take the - the lexan cover off of win- dow 5, that you alternate handling that photography to keep under the legal doses."
ail right; we'll do that.
"15, houston. the doctors down here with their - with their electrocardiograms see that the cmp - or at least they think the cmp - is on the - the biomed apparatus; and, according to the flight plan, they'd like to have the lmp on."
"okay. we thought we'd give you both, since you were sort of interested in that yesterday."
okay; that would be great.
"15, houston. we have a couple of camera pads when you have time to copy."
"okay; stand by a couple of minutes, will you please, karl?"
roger.
"okay, karl. i'll copy those pads for you."
"roger. they're in the flight plan at 216. the first one is the solar corona photo pad. t-start is 216:03:55. down below, the mapping camera photo pad: start, 216:18:30, stop 217:18:15."
"copied 216:03:55, 216:18:30, and 217:18:5 - 15."
that's correct.
"15, houston. if you'll give us accept, we'll send up a new state vector."
roger.
"15, houston; the computer is yours."
roger.
"hey, al. i've sort of got an itch to hear what the aristarchus region looks like in daylight. you got any comments?"
"well, i'll tell you, karl; we've all been setting here kind of looking at aristarchus a little bit in awe. it looks like probably the most volcanic area that i've seen anywhere on the surface. and certainly it's just very covered with rilles, very - quite deep rilles, too, some of them. schroter's valley, for instance, is a magnificent big rille, which looks like it's worked - been worked twice; of course, the large rille and then a smaller rille inside."
what about the source of schroter's valley? ._ 08 23 19 56 cmp several cones - say again?
what about the source of schroter's valley. does it look volcanic?
"well, that whole area in there looks volcanic. yes. and that certainly comes from - from up on the plateau, there. i would guess that the cobra head is the source for schroter's valley. the elevation is - is a little subtle from this - from this vantage point, but i - i guess that would be my guess. and as far as where the - think we've found something interesting anyway about the - the ends of the rilles, particularly around the schroter's valley area. it looks quite distinctly like the rilles - the - the mouths of the rilles - or the deltas have been covered with rising maria - mare materials - from the lower - from the - from the lower elevation. almost as if there was a - a - a rille with a deltalike deposit at one time, but then the mare - the elevation of the mare - or the height of the mare came up into the rille far enough to - to cover all that delta area. so all you see now is what would look like a - a - a river into a lake whose elevation has increased."
"ah, ha! very interesting thought."
"15, this is houston. i'm turning you over to joe, now. i'll see you on the way home tomorrow."
"okay, karl. talk to you tomorrow. thanks for coming out so early for us."
"it was a pleasure, believe me."
"good morning, yankee clipper; this is houston."
"good morning, endeavour; this is houston."
"good morning, houston; this is endeavour. how are you today?"
"just fine, dave."
the devil in the backup commander made me do the other.
"well, we're not surprised."
seems like that other fellow is hung up on that other flight for some reason or another.
"endeavour, this is houston. we're about 4 minutes from los. you look to be in good shape to go around the corner."
"roger. thank you, houston. apollo 15 air-_d-ground voice transcription 08 23 56 -- begin lunar rev 71"
"hello, endeavour, this is houston requesting reacq and narrow on the high gain."

"hello, houston; 15."
"hello, 15; this is houston."
"okay, joe, we're reading you. and we were in reacq and narrow and couldn't seem to pick you up, so we're back in manual and medium, now."
"okay, al; we copy that. thank you. while we're thinking about that one, we've got a couple of _ requests for you here. we'd like for you to turn on your rcs propellant, secondary. we're expecting a crossover in the d and c quads during the shape ullage, and we can, i guess, use those on now. and i've got some small changes to your flight plan when you are ready to copy."
"okay, joe, i'm ready to copy the changes in the flight plan."
"okay, jim. i assume you're reading me loud and clear. you're still a little bit - have a little noise in the background. if you have your flight plan in front of you, the first entry is at 217 plus 17. and it is an addition: ""retract map camera."" the next one is at 217 plus 21. addi- tion: ""close map camera and laser experiment covers."" the third is at 217 plus 58; delete _- those two lines: ""02 heaters, three, auto; 02 heaters i and 2, off."" those are two deletions. another deletion - -"
"okay. let me read that back to you, joe."
"okay, fine, jim."
"you have 217:17, retract the mapping camera. at 217:21, close map camera and laser covers. and then the deletion at 217:58 of the 02 heaters, three and 02 heaters i and 2."
"that's correct, jim. and the next change is - it's a deletion at 218:02, and that is delete the ""pcm cable"" line, there. and down a couple of inches, at 218:08, an addition: ""map camera and laser experiment covers to open, and extend map camera."" read back."
"okay. i understand to delete the pcm cable at 218:02, and then at 218:08 map camera and laser covers open, and extend mapping camera."
"the readback is correct and the next - next change is at 219:07; and once again delete the ""pcm cable"" line. and at 219:17 add, ""laser altimeter, off; close map camera and laser experiment covers."" and delete map camera extension. and the last addi- tion, that is to say the last change, is at 220 plus 05, delete the ""pcm cable"" line. over."
"okay. i copied 220:05 delete the pcm cable, and go on back to page 4 before we deleted the pcm cable there at 219:07. and at 219:17, a new item, laser altimeter, off. close mapping camera and laser experiment covers, and then delete the next line - the ""map camera track to extend."""
"sounds good, jim, and that's all i have for the moment. we do want a verification that all four propellant secondaries are opened on your rcs, please."

okay. thank you.

"hello, endeavour. this is houston with photog- raphy pads, and a tei-73 pad, when you're ready."
"okay, joe. i'm ready to copy the photo pads."
"okay, jim. i've got a map camera photo pad, a pan camera pad, and a terminator photo pad for you. and before i start, just a word of ex- planation. because of your change of trajectory from what we considered a nominal one, we've got some details to add to the pad that involve image- motion setting changes and exposure changes. and i'll read those in detail, in a moment. i just wanted to give you a word of explanation on it. the first pad is the map camera photo pad copied at 217 plus 10; and at 217 plus 10 it is t-start: 218 plus 16 plus 59; t-stop: 219 plus 16 plus 44. over. 09 00 53 0t imp roger. copy. 218:16:59; 219:16:44."
"that's correct, jim. and if you'll turn.the page now, i want you to delete two lines, one at 218 plus 35 and that is, ""map camera image motion - increase, talkbaek barber pole, on."" delete that, and delete the line at 218 plus 55, which read, ""map camera image motion - increase, talkback barber pole plus four steps"" et cetera. and, in- stead, put in the instructions: at t-start- it should be barber pole plus four. at 218 plus 39 plus 00, barber pole plus three; and at 218:49 plus 00;barber pole plus four. read back, please. _-_ 09 00 54 4g _ okay, the instructions are that at t-start, it should be barber pole plus 4; at 218 plus 39 plus 00, barber pole plus three; at 218 plus 49 plus 00, barber pole plus four."
"that's correct, jim. and those are your image- motion settings, and you're to delete the other two image-motion instructions in the flight plan. one at 218:35 and the other at 218:55, and i know you got that. the second - - 09 00 55 29 _ yes, i made those two deletions."
"okay, the second is the terminator photo pad to copy at 218 plus 07. and it is t-start: 218 plus 15 plus 19. over."
218:15:19.
"roger. and finally, the pan camera photo pad. copy at 218 plus 39. t-start: 218 plus 52 plus 55. t-stop: 219 plus 16 plus 44. and delete the two pen camera exposure lines. the first one at 218 plus 57. delete that. and the second one at 219 plus 03. delete that. and in- stead, use these exposure instructions. at 219 plus 00 plus 13, decrease. at 219 plus 00 plus 50, normal. at 219 plus 06 plus 35, decrease. at 219 plus 07 plus 28, normal. read back, please."
"okay. i understand the instructions on the pen camera. exposure at 219 plus o0 plus 13, it's decrease; 219 plus 00 plus 50, it's normal; 219 plus 06 plus 35, it's decrease; 219 plus 07 plus 28, it goes back to normal."
"that's right, jim. and give me the t-start, and t-stop times, please."
"okay, t-start was 218:52:55; end 219:16:44."
"sounds fine, end i'm holding a tei-73 pad when you're ready for that."
"stand by l, joe. 09 o1 o0 01 i_ okay, joe. i'm ready here for the tei pad."
"roger, jim. it's tei-?3, sps/g&n: 36188; plus 0.63, plus 0.98; 221, 47, 42.81; plus 2883.3, minus 0661.3, minus 0195.5; 179, /28, 350. all the rest is na. ullage, four jets, 12 seconds. other: the pad assumes no shape _neuver, and it assumes the lift-off refs_at. over."

"okay, jim. right on. th_k you. _ 09 o1 04 09 cc endeavour, this is houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"roger, jim. just for your own thinking, we'd like to advise you that we have reviewed the cue card f-k1 for the plane-change burn that a1 copied, and its update is still valid for your shape burn later on. we're in the process of going over your eps thrusting procedures on g5-1 in the checklist, and we see very - only very minor changes that we'll be coming up to you with regarding your burn later on today, so i think things are pretty well in hand down here. over."
"okay, we copy. thank you, joe. 09 o1 05 lb cc another item regarding that, fao wants me to urge you again just to follow the flight plan items _-_ regarding sim bay operation before and _er these burns coming up, and we'll get no - we'll get into no problems at all. over. 09 o1 05 b5 cmp roger. understand. 09 o1 28 5b cc endeavour, this is houston. we have no problems at all as you come up on 5 minutes before los. al, we do have a question for you, if this is a good time to ask it. over."
"yes; go ahead, joe."
"roger. alfredo, we're sitting down here wondering if, perhaps, at sometime over the past few days you've gotten a visual c_ the mass spectrometer boom and unit, and if so, has it been possible at all to determine which direction the mass spec might be twisting as you move through the orbit over the mock? over. 09 o1 29 b7 cmp yes. i have seen that, joe, and i've - haven't watched a great deal of twisting and, as a matter of fact, i was rather surprised that there wasn't more twist than what i observed. i may not have picked up the maximum deflection, but i only ob- served about a - maybe a 5- or 10-degree rotation on the end of the boom; and, as i recall, as i was looking at it from inside the spacecraft, the rotation was counterclockwise."
"okay, al. that's interesting information. we don't necessarily expect it to have rotated more, but just wondering if you had some good visual data for us, and that's excellent. another com- ment, and it's more in the way of a reminder; during your eva, we're going to ask you to look very closely at the v over h sensor, and the symptoms we've had concerning that sensor down here is as though it has a small crack in the lens, or perhaps there's foreign contamination of some kind down in the barrel. and we're going to ask you to look particularly for either a crack or contamination in the barrel during the eva. just wanted to lay that one on you now, in case we forgot it later on. we'll most likely remind you of it later on."
"roger, joe. i understand that one."
"endeavour, we'd like a pro on the p20 now, please."
"okay, that's in work, joe."
roger; jim. thanks.
yes.

"roger, dave. looking downstream a little bit here, i know you'll be interested to know that both the shape burn and the satellite jett will be coming up very close to the nominal times in your flight plan. and we've got the photo pads here when you're ready to copy, and there are only a few lines. over."
"okay, joe; go ahead."
"roger. the first is a terminator photo pad to go in at 220 plus 05; and it reads t-start, 220 plus 13 _ plus 45. over. 09 02 26 21 _ roger, joe. t-start, 220:13:45."
"thank you, jim. and i've got a milestone for you to add here - a pan camera photo pad with a t-start of 220 plus 15 plus 25. and the instructions on that are: ""run the pan camera to film depletion."" and your indication is talkback barber pole. that's a lot of feet of film. and finally, an entry at 221 plus 59 - it's an addition which reads ""circuit breaker 02 tank 100 w heaters, three, main b, closed. over."
"okay; on the last one, it was 221:59, circuit breaker 02 heaters - 100 watt heaters, three, main b, closed. and then going back to the entry for a - f a t-start time of the pan camera of 220:15:25, and run the camera to film depletion, t-lkback barber pole."
"right on, jim. thank you."

"roger, jim. coming up on our tec partial gamma ray extension, and looking downstream towards that, we are requesting that you time the gamma ray boom extension, which you're going to do at 219 plus 19 - and we'll be standing by for that time. and also requesting - that you get on the biomed via the flight plan, please."
okay.
"and, endeavour, it's your computer."
"endeavour, please terminate battery bravo charge."
roger. battery bravo terminating.

"roger. a question on your pan camera. when you turned the power off, was it already barber pole or was it gray and then went to barber pole as you threw the switch? over."
it was already barber pole.
"okay, thank you. and we're standing by for a1 on the headset."
okay; let's - let us get all this sim _ay stuff cleaned up first.
roger.
"and, endeavour; this is houston. you're coming up on 8 minutes to los. and we'll just go over the tei procedures c_ the next rev. no hurry on that at all."

"okay, we copy that, endeavour. you can go ahead and power it down. we've run through to the last of the pan camera film."
roger.
"and, 15, we've powered up the drugstore to receive the film when you get home."

"okay, endeavour, i guess we're ready to start. i want to put one final note on the subsat launch. we'd like for you to reverify for us the talkbacks on the rcs after the launch."
okay. understand. check the rcs talkbacks after the launch. we 'll do that.
"okay, dave, and i guess you might cast an eye up at the - the few - fuei cell - talkbacks as well. over."
roger.
"endeavour, this is houston. ready to tag up with you on the tei procedures. and, dave, i guess we're standing by for your rec_mendation. do you want to read through the additions you now have in your p40 sps thrusting checklist, or do you want us to go through the changes we want you to have there? it looks pretty much exactly like your tli maneuver. there're just two changes; there're two differences from that, i guess. over. r_"
"okay, why don't you give us the two differences, and then we'll read it all back to you to make sure we've got it straight."
"okay, dave. that sounds like a good way. turn to page g/5-4. and right down at the bottom of the page - -"
5-4. go.
"roger. right at the bottom of the page after the two lines, ""sps fuel/oxidize pressure"" and ""pugs balanced,"" add the step ""cut-off minus 10 seconds, circuit breaker sps pilot valve, main a to open."""
"okay; bottom line on page 5-4. cut-off minus 10 seconds, ""circuit breaker sps pilot valve, main a, open."""
"that's correct. and turning over a page to 5-5, you have an addition underneath the normal step which reads, ""circuit breaker sps pitch i and yaw 1 to open."" your addition reads, ""circuit breaker .sps pilot valve, main b, open."" and we have still another step to add in there, which is, ""circuit breaker ems, two of them, main a and main b, to open."" and, also, we would like to delete, one step below that, the three lines ""map camera, on, to off,"" ""pan camera power to off,"" and ""sm/ac power to off."" over."
"okay; on page 5-5, beneath the addition of ""cb/sp -"
"- sps pilot valve, main b, open,"" add ""cb _s, two, open,"" and then delete the three lines on map camera, pan camera, and s_4/acpower below that."
"that's correct, dave, and we're standing by for the other additions you've made, now."
"okay, we'll go back to the beginning, here. okay; our initial configuration has the addition of both pilot valve circuit breakers open, and to verify that both eps group 5 circuit breakers are closed, and also on page 5-1, beneath the caution/warning test, e_cb _jnction, off, to verify, and the cb ems a and b both closed. that's w_at we have on 5-1."
okay; that's good. turn the page.
"okay, on 5-2, under ""tvc check and prep,"" second ·f'_' line, ""cb sps(10), closed."" that's ail on 5-2."
roger.
"page 5-b, at minus 2 minutes, ""cb sps pilot valve, main b, closed,"" instead of delta-3 - delta-v thrubt a and b, normal."""
that ts correct.
"okay. and on page 5-4, at 5 minutes prior to ignition, when we get - 5 seconds prior to ignition when we get the flashing 99, we delta-v thrust a and b to normal after the pro. and then, on down at ignition, if we have a flashing 97, the sps thrust fail, ""cb sps pilot valve a, closed."" and, if everything goes according to hoyle, why, at 5 seconds, we'll close the c - cb sps pilot valve mi - main a. and then, of course, the step you just answered - just added - at the bottom of the page, at cut-off minus l0 seconds, to close the pilot valve - or to open the pilot valve main a."
"okay, dave. that's right on the money."
"okay. and then on 5-5, we just discussed those two, which were a cb sps pilot valve, main b, open, and the ems circuit breakers, open."
"roger, dave. that sounds good to us."
okay; and i think we've practiced one of those once before. i think we'll be able to handle that.
"dave, just out of curiosity, we know you or a1 - -"
yes.
"- - marked up the cue card for the plane change maneuver, and we wonder if you're going to use that marked-up card for the shape burn. over."
"no, no. we won't. we'll use the checklist straight __ through on the rest of the burns."
"okay, dave. that's fine with us as we know you're aware it's a single bank b burn, which has been makred correctly onto that cue card."
"roger. yes, i guess all - all our burns in orbit are just a straight single bank b."
right on. thank you.
"and, coming out, we'll have all the ball valves open and all the eyeballs watching."
sounds like a good idea.
"and, houston; endeavour."
go ahead.
we were just getting the hoses set up here for the burn and noticed that there's a little bit of water ccming out of the - the blue hose in the suit loop. thought you might be interested.
"okay, dave. we copy that. thank you."
roger.
"not much. it's just, if you put your hand around the nozzle there, why, you can get some water on it."
"okay; we copy that. we think it's probably normal, but we'll look into it real closely. sounds to me like the endeavour has a few plumbers aboard as well as experts in other things."
"well, by the time this is over, i guess we will be plumbers."
"we'll all be plumbers, davy. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"endeavour, you're looking good. you're go for the shaping burn."
roger. go for the shape.
"okay, houston. endeavour with a burn status report."
"go ahead, endeavour."
"okay. burn was on time, and it was a 3-second burn. we had about 1.0 or 1.1 residual, and that was trimmed to 0.1, minus 0.2, minus 0.2. delta-v c was minus ll.0; fuel, 26.50; oxidizer, 26.25."
"roger, dave. we copy that. 09 05 22 _0 cdr and it has us in an orbit of 76.0 by 54.3. 09 05 22 _8 cc sounds just right. 09 05 22 5h cdr and very smooth burn."
"okay, dave. great. and you just gained about 2_0 more days for our subsatellite, something like that."
very good.
"endeavour, this is houston. you're looking good at ids minus 5. and i have a reminder on your water dump. we'd like you to monitor it down to l0 percent. and we'll see you on the other side. over."

"endeavour, we're requesting you go back to auto and do another verb 49, please. we see you've drifted off about a degree."
in work.
"okay, endeavour. we're recommending that you go back to free at launch minus i minute. 09 06 35 32 i_p okay; free at launch minus i minute."
"endeavour, we've got a new update for the last instructions. go free at launch, please."
roger; free at launch.
"3, 2, i-"
launch. we have a barber pole.
and a gray.
we confirm that.

"okay, dave; copied that. sounds great."
can you see much?
"oh, it looks like it might be oscillating maybe 10 degrees at the most. _-_"
"roger, dave; copy."
"and, endeavour, when you're ready, i've got a coming-home pad to read to you."
"stand by l, joe."
"okay, jim. and we would like accept, please, on the computer."
stand by 1.
"a very pretty satellite out there. we get about two flashes per rev off of each boom, and it seems to be rotating quite well. very stable."
"very good, dave. thank you."
"and, joe, i'm ready to copy that coming-home pad."

"right on, jim. thank you."
"good ship, endeavour, be advised that our tracking stations have acquired the satellite."
"oh, very good."
"apollo 15, houston. 09 07 01 07 _ go ahead."
"roger. jim, this is a comment for you. when i was reading the flight plan update to you, we noticed that you might be coming up on something not too clear in the flight plan, and it involves the long list of steps between 224 plus 00 and 224 plus about 15. and there are a n_,mher of steps in there that have to be accomplished before the t-start time on the map camera photo pad. it may be, you - you'll want to start on a few of them, i guess, a little early. over."
"okay, thank you, joe."
"endeavour, this is houston. we'll be requesting 0mni delta when you lose the up-link."
roger; omni delta .... to go.
"hello, endeavour; this is houston."
"houston, endeavour. go."
"roger, endeavour. i have three requests for you. the first, the optics is in the cmc mode, and we've noticed it drifting off. we'd like you to drive it manually back to a value less than l0 degrees in trunnion and then zero it. we're also waiting for a dap load and a p40. and i have a guaranteed last correction to your flight plan, when you're ready. 09 07 17 40 imp okay, number l, we've still got to m_ke the star check. we'll take care of that, and i hope - i _-_ hope you've already seen the dap load and the p40, but we'll take a look at it again for you."
"okay, joe. we - i'm ready to take that last change to the flight plan."
"okay, jim; stand by 1."
"okay, jimmy, this is an easy one. at 224 plus 14, we want you to delete the line that reads ""map camera image motion to on, talkback barber pole in 3 to 5 seconds, then gray."" delete that line, please. over."
"okay, that's an easy one. i'll delete that line that says ""map camera image motion, on, tal_back barber pole in 3 to 5 seconds, then gray."""
"roger, jim. thank you."
"hello, endeavour; this is houston."
"okay, houston, endeavour. go."
"roger. dave, al, and jim, be advised you're go for transearth injection. set your sails for home. we're predicting good weather, a strong tailwind, and we'll be waiting on the dock. over."
"okay. thank you very much, houston. we'll see you around the corner."
roger. we'll be watching. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"hello, houston. endeavour's on the way home with a burn status report for you."
roger. sounds good; striding by.
"roger. ignition was on time. burn time was 2 plus 21. no trim. our residuals were minus 0.2, plus 0.6, and plus 0.2. delta-v c was minus 16.7; fuel 2.35; oxidizer, 2.2; the unbalance was about minus 25. and what a smooth burn that one was."
"roger. sounds very good to us, dave."
just can't beat these rocket engines for traveling. _-_ 09 08 05 05 cc i should hope not.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"houston, 15. go."
"roger. two questions. one, we notice you have a/c roll jets selected. i guess we aren't sure whether you have b - a/c roll jets selected on dap, we aren't sure whether you have a/c or b/d selected on the panel."
"okay, i'll check it ... okay, a/c, you're selected."
"okay, and could we pry out of you guys any comments on the moon as you leave?"
"well, we're almost speechless looking at the thing. _ it's amazing. looks like we're going straight up. and we're leaving_ there's no doubt about that. and we're right on the terminator. it shows very distinctly all the topography - all the topographic highs and lows. and we can see some major rilles. and we noticed one large lava filling within a de- pression with domes very prominent within the lava fill. oh, it's just really pretty spectacular. we have one crater almost below us that has a flat floor with radial rilles and circumferential rilles extending from the central peaks. i think we saw that as we flew over."
roger; copy. sounds beautiful.
"it's really spectacular. the elevation - the topography on the ridge line is quite clear, and, of course, all the features near the terminator stand out quite well because of the shadows. and we're busily taking pictures so m_ybe we can bring some of it back for you to see."
be looking for it in 3 or 4 days.
"roger. it's really spectacular though, and there's no question that we're leaving. as a matter of fact, the first glimpse we got, it was quite obvious that we're on the way."
"that's a pretty good view after all those days of _ going around and around, isn't it, dave?"
"yes, boy."
"looks like we're going straight out, dick."
yes. reminiscing for me. thank you.
"although, i'll tell you, we never got to see half of what we passed over, i'm sure. there's just so much up there."
"well, i'll tell you, dave, i'm not so sure you guys didn't get at least your share, or maybe a little more. spectacular."
roger.
"well, i guess our orbital geologist up here just figured out which way we were. i guess we were sort of momentarily disoriented there, because south is up, and we're looking right up and down the terminator. so i guess we're upside down look- ing at new territory that we haven't seen during the flight."
"jim just said, ""gee, maybe i ought to look out my window."" and, by golly, out his window, he 's looking up - he's looking up to the north. as a matter of fact, out window number 5 now, you can get a full half - half-moon view. and you can see it all in one big gulp, and boy, what a gulp."
"we'll look at tycho, now, before too long."
that's a good point; we can't see it yet.
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, bob, i'm looking from humboldt straight south now, and, in fact, you can draw a line between humboldt and the - and a great ditch or scarp to the south. and there's quite a change in the light level or the intensity of the albedo in - between _-_ those two areas. and it looks like there's some - you know - very smooth fresh lava flows throughout that area. and, in fact, we noticed that while we were in orbit also, that in several of those areas around humboldt there, to the north of humboldt, and to the east of humboldt, that the flows in some of the craters there - (and they're quite distinct flows, you can see where they've lapped up against the sides, and you can also see where they've come - where they've spilled down over the sides, sort of reminiscent of the coso hills flow) - you can - we looked at these flows and realized that they looked fresh. and yet they had a lot more - the crater count was a lot higher on them than it was on the surrounding terrain. and this flow we're - kind of looking at now looks - it's a very large area, and it looks like it's just filled - seeped into some craters down there, some of the large craters. it looks much fresher in color. it hasn't - it doesn't look like it has been worked up as much. the craters that pit the lava flow are much sharper than they are, say farther to the east. but the count seems to be much higher; the crater count seems to be much higher, even here."
copy al. very interesting.
"and, houston; 15. as we leave and look back, why, i guess we still have the impression the moon is mostly gray. however, when you're up-sun, as we were just prior to tei- when you're looking up-sun, it does definitely take on a chocolate-brown color. _-_ we came around prior to tpi on the dayside - or tei on the dayside, looking backwards into the sun across schroter's valley, and that was a pretty spectacular sight. and it did start turning a chocolate brown, but now everything is a variation of gray, from very light to a gun-metal gray near the terminator."
"well, is that a unanimous vote in the spacecraft, dave ?"
roger. i got three ayes on that one.
"roger. we'll add that, and continue to keep the score."
good.
someday i'll get up there.
"hey, bob, we don't report to you the other kind."
someday i'll get up there and make my report.
i hope so.
"we can see a point on the terminator now where we mentioned we saw a lava filling and some domes in a depression which is not the circular craterlike depression; it's a big cavity. and now, i guess, as the sun angle has changed some, we can see where the lava has apparently spilled over a scarp into a deeper cavity, which is in - in shadow. and it's very clearly a filling of the cavity with two levels."
"roger, dave. we call that a polye, don't we?"
"well, i guess if we were in hawaii."
"you guys don't see any motion of that stuff, do you?"
stand by. we'll watch it.
"and, houston; 15. we got another unanimous vote up here. that was really a great trip."
"roger. i think that's unanimous on everyone, isn't it?"
roger.
"and, 15, if you'll give us accept, we'll up-link a refsmmat for desired orientation ptc."
roger. you've got it.
"and, 15, it's your computer again."
"roger, houston."
"and, apollo 15; houston. we'd like that verb 49 maneuver, so we can pick up high gain, please."
"roger. we just did it, bob."
thank you.
"hey, houston, take a look at the dsky. i think those are the numbers you gave us."
"roger, 15. those are the numbers. look good, thank you."
"and, 15; houston. we'd like gamma ray gainstep, on, up, three clicks. over."
"okay. gainstep, on, up, three clicks."
"apollo 15, houston."
"go ahead, bob."
"roger. we'd like to move that ""verb 49 maneuver to lunar surface photo attitude"" that you'll find at r -_ 225:30 in the flight plan. we'd like to move that up to 225:24. over."
"roger. understand; move the ""verb 49 maneuver"" to 225: 24."
roger.
"apollo 15, houston. 09 09 25 b1 cmp houston, 15. go."
roger. be advised we'll be monitoring your maneuver here in case you get in your gimbal lock. and the high gain angles in case you lose antenna lock in _-_ the new attitude will be pitch of minus 45 and yaw of 024. over.
roger. understand pitch minus 45 and yaw 024 if we lose it.
roger.
"and thanks for watching it for us, bobby."
"and, 15, if one of you has time, i have a few more flight plan updates for you."
"okay, houston. stand by 1. go ahead, bob."
"okay, the pitch and yaw angles for the p20 - p52 attitude at 226:00 is: pitch is minus 37; yaw of 322. -"
"understand at the p52 attitude, it's pitch minus 37, yaw 322."
"roger. at 226:15, we're changing that verb 49 maneuver attitude to the following coordinates: 327, 143, 055."
"roger. copy the change to the verb 49 maneuver that occurs at 226:15 to 327, 143, and 055."
"roger. and the high gain angles will be pitch 13, yaw 212. 09 09 27 58 cml roger. pitch 13, yaw 212."
roger. stand by.
"and, 15, we're observing yaw of 61 degrees right now."
"15, houston. we have 65 degrees yaw."
"roger, bob; we're watching."
"okay, three more flight plan updates, jim, if you're ready."
"go ahead, bob. _ 09 09 29 06 cc okay, at 226:22, on - it will be a line above the line that says ""x-ray, on."" the new line that will be added will be ""x-ray, off, for i second; then."" over."
"understand. the new line added above ""x-ray, on,"" and it'll read ""x-ray, off, i second; then."""
"roger, that's good. at 227:32, we'll add a line on top of the ""verb k8"" line that says ""x-ray, standby."""
"roger. understand. at 227:32, ""x-ray to standby."""
"roger. and at 227:57, on a line with the mass spec on it, we'll change that ""discriminator, high,"" to ""discriminator, low."""
"understand. ""discriminator, low"" instead of ""discriminator, high."""
now that completes the update for now.
"roger. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription _' 09 09 44 43 cdr houston, apollo 15."
"roger, 15. go."
roger. do you have any best guess on mcc-5 yet - whether or not we'll have one?
"standby. it's not going to be very large. 09 09 45 0b cdr well, the question is whether or not we have to prepare for it. and we have another request. we'd like to reschedule the uv photos presently scheduled for 239:10 to some other time, primarily because of the stowage in here. we've got most of the uv equipment already stowed beneath the rocks in prep for the eva, and - to go in and go out of the stowage container takes a fair amount of time. and we'd like to reschedule that if it's possible."
roger. assume you mean after the eva?
roger.
okay. stand by.
okay. this is a - this is a crowded fellow up here.
you guys shouldn't have brought so many rocks back.
"well, i guess every once in a while we wonder."
but we don't wonder very long.
"okay, dave. first of all, no problem, we can de- lay those uv photos until after the eva. second, ""'""'_ right now midcourse 5 looks like 2 feet per sec- ond, and we do want to do it. over."
"okay, thank you. that's a couple of quick answers; appreciate it. that - that will help us in our planning. _-_ 09 09 47 17 cc okay, that is only a preliminary estimate on that midcourse 5 though."
that's okay; that tells us the difference between simsand rcs kind of burns.
oh; roger.
"and, 15; houston. one more thing if it's convenient."
go ahead.
"go ahead, bob."
"okay. at your convenience, we'd like to verify or check the primary accumulator fill valve on until the primary accumulator quantity - that's for the glycol loop - is up to 50 to 55 percent. this is the result of a review of the eva checklist for tomorrow. it ass_-,es that this has already been checked and that w_'re at the 50 to 55 per- cent level so we'd like this check - you could do it tonight when you're getting ready for sleep or something."
"okay, we'll do it right now. that's planning abead."
copy.
"okay, houston. our prim accumulator quantity is now about at 51 percent."
roger. we copy; thank you. 09 09 50 _0 cmp and we filled it from about 45.
thnnk you.
"and if you have any other goodies you think we ought to check over, might as well do it this evening."
"roger, dave. that's the only goody we came upon -"
"stan - stand by. okay, 15. that's the only goody we've had from the review of the eva check- list for tomorrow. that - that's the only one we could find. an extra goody that we'd like this t evening sometime. if you fellows intend to use the vacuum cleaner - is for you to give us a - a cue when you turn it on, so we can check and '_ watch the currents. they saw a - l_ny on a ac bus - or an extra current load on an ac bus, and they think you were using the vacuum cleaner then. they'd like to verify that by watching it again when you use the vacuum cleaner."
"okay. well, we've been using it quite often on and off."
"okay. just sometime when you use it, if you give us a cue as you turn it on, that would help."
"okay, i - i guess we dccf't see any need for it this evening. and we could check it out if you'd like - -"
"no, no."
- - ... pretty well. the cabin's nice and clean and i -
"roger, dave. no, that's just a callout. the next time you happen to get around to feeling dirty and want to use the vacuum cleaner, give us a call if you would please."
okay. we'll do it.
"houston, 15. did you get the p52 numbers? 09 l0 l_ 20 cc roger. we have all your p52 numbers, al."
"al, we know that one of them wasn't five balls."
say again. _ 09 10 1_ 44 cc roger. we noticed one of those didn't have five balls on it. 09 lo l_ 50 cmp roger. did you get the torquing angles on both the p52s?

"okay, have at it."
"okay, step 1, we'd like to know - you - you can give us these afterwards, but the first step is to determine the status of the service module sector 1 ac 2 circuit breakers on panel 181. those are three circuit breakers. number 2 is to deter- mine the status of the pan camera mode switch. n,,mber 3, after these have been done, pan ca/_f_a mode, standby; power, on, t,1kback barber pole for 2 seconds, then gray, and then stereo. number _, pan camera mode, operate, t-l_back barber pole for -- 2 seconds, then gray. number 5, operate pan camera until msfn cues, or until beginning of the sleep period. and number 6, on msfn cue, pan camera mcde to standby; and, after 1 minute, pan camera power, off. 0ver."

"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. roger. one more item we just got is a request that now that the covers on the x-ray are closed, we're requesting x-ray, on, for l0 minutes and then off. over."
"okay. x-ray, on, for l0 minutes and then off."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, the posit - the last posi- _-_ tion should be standby rather than off. over."
roger. standby.
"okay, houston. the x-ray is on, and we'll turn. it off in l0 minutes. anything else? tape1_7/3"
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. that's a standby in 10 minutes· i believe you understand that, _-_ dave, anyway. and i believe that the next - -"
roger.
"- - thing we will want from you is a call when you're ready to go to sleep. and we will verify all systems at that time so we can get a solid goodnight, rather than tagging on again like last night."
roger that.
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston· we see you cycling through the dap. we suggest you need a zero in r2 to get b/d roll. over."
"houston, 15."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, go."
"hey, bob, you didn't update the - arrange the load in the p20 for ptc· was that meant to be updated to .375, or shall we leave it at .35?"
"apollo 15, apollo 15, let's keep it at .375."
understand you want the flight plan updated to ·375.
"apollo 15, apollo 15, that's a roger."
roger. th8_k you. we got the update.
"houston, apollo 15."
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. go ahead."
"yes, bob. we're trying to retract the mapping camera. but the time has been well exceeded, and we still have the barber pole indication."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, stand by. _-_ 09 ll 59 59 cc apollo 15, apollo 15, we'd just as soon you didn't spin up quite yet. we still think the rates are a little high. over."
"okay, houston. we'll wait on your cue then."
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. concerning the mapping camera retraction problem, the question is, did you get a barber pole during the alpha/ x-ray cover procedure? over."
"you ought to amplify your question there a little bit, bob. you mean when we are - operating the covers?"
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. jim, the question basically is, did the barber pole - did the talk- back function properly when you just closed the alpha/x-ray covers? over."
"yes, dave said it works fine."
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. jim, stand by on that. we got your last answer, and they're working on it."
okay. i think i'll take the - go out of the retract position on the switch and just wait for your word.
"apollo 15, apollo 15, that sounds good to me, jim."
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. we'd like to hold off on ptc a little bit longer until we get this mapping camera business straightened out. and, jim, for some troubleshooting on this, we'd like to have you check on panel 181 the main a circuit breaker, closed, and the deploy/retract switch in the retract position. and on panel 278, the deploy main a circuit breaker, closed. over."
"those two circuit breakers and the switches are verified, bob, closed."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, copy. 09 12 l0 40 i/4p and on the presleep checklist: been no medication today. onboard readouts are bat c, 37; pyro bat a, 37.3; pyro bat b, 37.3. on the rcs, it's 56, 55, 54, and 55. and i guess, after we get ptc squared away, we'll give you e-memory dump. tape 1_7/5"
"apollo 15, apollo 15; eouston. copy the crew status and the onboard readout. and stand by on the e-mod_ we may ask you for that before ptc, but we'll be back with you on that in a minute. 09 12 12 h8 cdr houston, 15."
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. go."
"roger. un - unless you got a solution for the camera now, why don't we troubleshoot it in the morning and get on with our evening powerdown. okay?"
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. that's a roger. we've just come to that conclusion ourselves down here. we're ready for an e-mod dump before the start of ptc, please."
"okay. it's on the way, 09 12 l_ 18 cc apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. one last attempt on the mapping camera. we suggest you try mapping camera doors, open, then retract, and then doors, close, if successful on the retract. and you can do that while - after you start up ptc, if you like. 09 12 l_ 38 cdr roger. we've already attempted to do that, bob. 09 12 lh _3 cc apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. roger. you're ahead of building _5. and, apollo 15, apollo 15, we have a good e-mod dump."
"houston, 15. how do the rates look now?"
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. your rates look good. you're go for ptc."
"okay. we'll try. 09 12 15 _6 cc apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. as soon as you configure the mass spec -- multiplier, low; discriminator, low; experiment, on; i0n source, on; et cetera --you're go for sleep. then, no more comments from the ground until morning."
roger.
"apollo 15, apollo 15, houston is out for the _-_ evening."
"don't go too far out, though."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, our ever watchful eye will be on you while you sleep."
very good.
"houston, 15 .... initial rates ..."
"apollo 15, apollo 15; nouston. you called just as we lost and locked onto the heigh - onto the omni."
"okay, bob. just wanted to know how the initial rates of ftc looked?"
"apollo 15, apollo 15, initial rates look good. we'll be keeping an eye on it though for you, al."
"okay, bob. it just didn't look like i got quite as much rate when i entered on that as i expected. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription 1"
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"apollo 15, houston. over. 09 12 43 03 cm_p houston, 15. go."
"roger, 15. would you believe that we have one more call on the pan camera? we - do not show pan camera power to off, please, and unfortunately, that means that we might heat up the film too much. so we would like pan camera power to off. and, guys, as long as you're down there, would you mind trying mapping camera, r,'dhact, once more? 15, we see a certain rise in temperature there which may mean that it was frozen; it'll improve. and we do not see any - the mass spec configuration yet. and a progres s report on _our ptc says it's about 60 40, but - but it'll - it will last the night."
"houston, it doesn't look like the mapping camera is going to come back in. what's the problem if it's left out?"
"15, houston. would you believe we've just deter- mined that it doesn't seem to be a problem if it stays out overnight. 09 12 48 35 (24p great. then i guess we can call it quits for tonight. okay?"
i sure hope so.
(laughter) okay .... - -
"15, we don't have tm on you right now.' is the mass spec taken care of?"
roger. the mass spec's taken care of. there's one switch out of position. and the mapping camera is going to go to off.
"roger. copied, dave. we'll try again."
okay.
"apollo 15, houston. in the blind, no need to reply. our pan camera data still shows power, on. this is the middle switch in the bottom row. the power boost switch should be in the center off position. no need to reply. over. _ tapes 149-151/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription rest period - no communications apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription 09 19 _5 _6 cc good morning, endeavour. this is apollo control in houston, texas, tuning the band. over. 09 19 _6 21 cdr good morning, tuning the band. this is endeavour. go. 09 19 _6 30 cc roger. good morning, endeavour. this is houston with csm consumables and a few good words about your flight plan, when you're ready. 09 19 _6 46 cdr just stand by 1 09 19 46 h8 cc okay, dave. and you troops sure start the day early up there, i must say."
"yes, seems that way, doesn't it?"
"okay, houston. we've located the flight plan. go ahead with your updates."
"endeavour, this is houston. were you calling?"
"roger, joe. we've located the flight plan. go ahead with your updates."

"15, this is houston. how do you read?"
"last i heard was g_ma ray. go ahead. 09 19 53 _2 cc okay. the rest of that mysterious transmission is essentially the following, dave. we've got a funny in that gamma ray experiment, and - so we're going to - to want to modify the use of it a little .f-_ bit today. it should be no major imposition, but the flight plan calls out for the gamma ray boom to be retracted at 236 hours. we'd like to modify that by saying, turn the gainstep, shield off, at that time, and we'll want you to retract it about l0 minutes later. we'll give you a cue for that. over."
"okay. gainstep, shield off, at 236 and stand by for your cue for retraction."
"that's correct, dave. i've got a few other good things here, but there's no hurry on any of them. be willing to stand by, if you wanted to get squared away and give me a call later, or whatever you'd like to do. it's your preference."
"well, let's go ahead, joe. we're getting squared away up here."
"okay. if you have the flight plan then, let me add the following. at 236 plus 45, add the step, ""x-ray to on."" and then turning over several -' pages - -"
"roger. 236:45; x-ray, on."
okay. and turning over several pages to 241 plus 25.
go.
"roger. after the step, ""02 heaters l, 2, and 3 to auto,"" add ""02 tanks i and 2, 50 watt heaters, main b, 2, to open."""
"okay. 241:25; 02 ri_ater - or 02 tank i and 2, 50 watt heaters, main b to open, and 02 tank heater - they're 50 watt also? main a_i, open? _"
"stand by, dave. i'm sorry about this one. stand by."
okay.
"okay, endeavour. let me try that again. had a typographical error down here. it should read ""02 tank 1, 50 watt heater, main b, l, open;"" and ""02 tanks 2 and 3, 50 watt heaters, main a, 2, /_ open."" over."
"okay. 02 tank l, 50 watt heater, main b, l, open; and tanks 2 and 3, 50 watt heaters, main a, 2, open."
"that's correct, dave. i apologize for the slow start there. now i've got some dap load changes that cover the times from about 2_7 hours to 252 hours. and - the change is apparently because of a mis - of a mistake in the flight plan you have on board that we, in the meantime, have caught down here. and - so there are several deletions and additions during that time. the first one starts at 2_7 plus 28. 09 19 58 _4 cdr go ahead. i've got it."
"okay. delete your verb 48, 11111 and xllll, and add - stand by a second."
that's twice. 09 19 59 l_ cc i'll be very careful from here on. stand by.
"okay, d.r. i,m ready to try it again. you've deleted at 247:28 the line with all the funny number ones, and you're suppose to delete in the dap load coll,m_ also that same entry. it's in the time collmmn, i guess. and then turn the page."
yes. roger.
"okay. go to 248 hours, on the next page, and in the note coll-,n, change the dap load status to _- read 11101. and the rest is the same. and this dap load status continues through the ptc until 251 hours. and the next change is at 251 hours and 4 minutes."
"okay. 251:0_, and i got the other three changes. go ahead. _-_ 09 20 01 17 cc okay. delete the verb _8 line and the dap load over in the time colm_mn there. tape 152/_"
okay.
"and the next change is at 251:47. delete the verb 48 line and the dap load in its corresponding time coll,m_."
"okay. and i guess over in the notes column, we're still carrying 11101. right?"
"that's affirmative, dave. and starting at 252 hours, your dap load status should read 111 - stand by."
okay. let me try again. starting - -
"okay. starting at 252 plus 00 hours, in the notes cod,mn, the dap load status should read lll01 times llll. and this should be carried through the rest period until 261 hours. over."
"okay, joe. you were saying something there about 252:30, as we lost cow,,. i got the entry at 252:00. was there any change at 252:30?"
"negative, dave. the change at 252:00 should just be continued through until 261 hours. and that's just the dap - dap load status - should be changed correspondingly through until that time."
okay. i see. and then we're - we're just 11101 all the way.
that's correct.
okay. go ahead on your next.
"dave, that's all i've got for the time being. and i think i'd be afraid to go ahead much further, if you're really counting those times. maybe i -_ should start keeping score on you as well."
(laughter) okay.
we're happy for the time being. we're - we're standing by for a crew status report at your convenience. and we'll be watching for the gainstep shield to come off.
okay. we'll get right back with you in about 5 or 10.
thank you.
"endeavour, this is houston. we'd like for you to retract the gamma ray boom for us, please, and we'll be watching for your torquing angles. also, if you'd like some news reporting in the background, i have the morning news here, if you're interested in that at all. over."
"roger. gamma ray going to retract now, and stand by on the news."
"okay. roger. you can use that as background for the p52, i guess. president nixon in effect declared u.s. responsibility for offensive ground- combat operations in vietnam at sm end. with the draft still in limbo, selective service went ahead today with the lottery to determine the order in which next year's 19-year-olds will face military service. secretary of state william p. rogers plans to go to the united nat - nations to push for a more energetic international relief effort for east pakistan today. the senate armed services commlttee completed action on a 21 billion dollar military buying bill that meets most nixon admin- istration weapons requests. president nixon and his f,m_ly will fly to manchester, new hampshire, and then to a private island in maine this weekend, when visits to new hampshire also are planned by four democratic presidential hopefuls and republican challenger rep - paul n. mcclosky, jr. predicted weather for recovery day is 2000 feet scattered, l0 miles vis, and waves approaching 6 feet. wind is north by northeast, 18 knots. i have a long list of baseball scores here, which i think i'll just glance over. in the american league, new york beat cleveland 7 to 3. i've had a local request for the dodgers, who lost to the astros 2 to 0. the american classic golf tournament starts today at the firestone country club in akron, ohio. and the win- ner will get $30 000 dollars. sounds to me like the pay's pretty good, and i expect the hours are short. the u.s. pan american team went on a fantastic gold _ medal spree yesterday, winning 17 - rather 16 of the 17 medals at stake. the only one the americans escaped getting was a gold medal in weight lifting. and the total in the games, which are being held in colombia, is 78 for the united states, 36 of them gold, and 51 for cuba, 12 of them are gold. and i'll end with a story comparable only to that incredible contest between the apollo 15 all stars and the north american rockets. last night in the texas league, 21-year-old right-hander tom walker, pitching for dallas-fort worth team, pitched a 15-inning, no-run, no-hit game against albuquerque. he retired the last 21 men in a row. only four albuquerque players got on base, and all of them were on walks. walker got the first 18 batters out before he walked the first one. he threw 153 pitches in the game, and the no-hitter is an all- time record in the texas league and may very well be an alltime record in major league baseball. walker's manager told him that if he did not win the game by the end of 15th inning, he was going to have to pull him out. walker said his arm felt a little tired, but he felt okay, understandably. like doing three evas i expect. and that's all the news for - for this morning. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
boy! it sounds like he's as good as our very own linky.
"that may well be, dave. i - that never occurred to me."
at least the equal thereof.
roger. at least almost.
"endeavour, we've copied the torquing angles. thank you. and, dave, if you can get a volunteer to work on the mapping camera for us, we'd like to try to pull that mapping camera in and get the covers closed in preparation for the eva. we're not quite sure the position that the camera's in right now and the procedure i'll - can read up step by step, but it's basically to open the covers, try to extend the camera, we'll confirm the extension, and then we'll have you retract the camera and ultimately retract the covers. and i'll be stand- lng by for your advice on this. over."
"okay, joe. we'll see if we have time to work on that. but it's my understanding we do not have to have it retracted for the eva."
"dave, that's my understanding, too. i think - the main reason - for wanting to do this if time is available and it's o - and it's only - would be a nicety - would be it - gives us a warm feeling regarding the film."
"dave, just to complete that last statement, you're correct. we don't have to have that device re- tracted for the eva. but, apparently, it - it gives the film people a nice feeling regarding _ their film not getting too cold or too hot. that's the reason for that."
"okay. well, let us see if we can get to it."
roger. just give a whistle.
okay. and we sort of flip-flopped that p23 and eat period so that we could take advantage of our setup for eating and all. and we'll get on with p23 as soon as we finish breakfast.
sounds good.
"apollo 15, this is houston. all other things being equal, troops, we'd prefer that you do the p23 before you begin the eat period, because it gives us an hour of pointed x-ray data during your eat period."
"okay, joe; but i guess the inequality is the stowage situation in here and assuring that we can get properly prepared for the eva. so - we'll start the p23 in probably about - oh - 5 minutes or so, because we're almost through eating. but we sort of have to take advantage of our configuration here in order to stay with the time line iater on."
"that's fine, dave. we understand. thank you."
"endeavour, this is houston."
go ahead.
"roger, i've got some information about your mid- course 5, which is scheduled to come up here. we have a firm decision that there will not be a mid- course 5 maneuver required, and the numbers behind that are a g-mrna of minus 6.69; your vacuum perigee is 18.4, and the midcourse 5 correction that we're showing now would be 3/10ths of a foot per second. the corresponding midcourse 7 correction runs at about 1.8 feet per second. and, based on that new information, we're wondering if you're still inter- ested in doing the uv photography at its scheduled time or waiting until after the - the eva. and we're also wondering what your choice will be on the solar corona photography. over."
"okay. that's pretty fantastic guidance, isn't it? let us - take another look at the flight plan here and come right back at you."
"okay, dave; fine. and no hurry on - on the - on that decision. we would like the gamma ray step shield, on, now, please. _ 09 20 45 06 cmp okay. gamma ray gainstep, on."
thank you.
"and, joe, i guess on the corona photography mag r has been ex - expended. and as far as the uv, it's not so much a problem of time. it's a prob- lem of stowage. it's stowed way down deep in one of endeavour's lockers here; and to get at it re- quires quite a bit of manipulation of bags. and that's the reason we wanted to delay that if it was possible."
"okay, dave. we understand that. and that - that sounds like it's a far more reason - reasonable to delay that. the timing's not critical as far as we're concerned. we just wanted to give you a balanced workday."
"okay; fine. we don't mind loading up a little after the eva, because it really saves us a lot of work in the long run. and you might wonder why we didn't put - the uv stuff somewhere else, but there's just nowhere else to put it but in its - in its own proper little spot."
"no, we understand. thank you."
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay. have a crew status report for you, and you can have the doctor take a look at the lmp bio and see if that's acceptable. _ 09 20 58 00 cc okay."
ready to copy?
go ahead.
"okay. seven hours sleep apiece, and prds 25028, 23193, 08031."
"okay, dave; thank you. and we see that we've got the x-ray going. we'd like for you to change the setting on the gainstep. give us a one-click in- crease, which will move us from - the position 7 back to position 1. over. _"
okay. you've got a one-click increase.
"okay. we see it, dave, and jim's bio looks clean to us down here. thank you."
okay.
"endeavour, give us six clicks on the gamma ray gain switch, please."
okay. six clicks.
"endeavour, this is houston."
"houston, endeavour. go."
"roger, dave. a couple of miscellaneous items i'd like to ask you about. first of all, the trench sends their congratulations to whoever's doing the p23 for us. the errors are less than 7 sigma - and they're awarding the honorary vasco da gama navigation award for excellence in this. secondly, we're puzzling over your remark about magazine romeo, which you reported to us was exhausted. and we're wondering if you just read - the frame number f_om the mag and, if so, what it read. over."
"yes. joe, this is al. the last reading on romeo, i think, was ll0."
"okay, al. thank you. and were you doing the p23's for us?"
si.
"okay. i'll tell you a little something about vasco da gama later on. another easy item here, you're going to come up on a bat charge - i guess bat b charge - starting at 239 hours, and we'd like to delay that to 244 hours, please."
okay. delay the bat b charge to 244. and be advised - you've got to know that we've got the best navigator in tranbearth lunar space up here.
"at least one of them, i'm sure."
"in fact, the only one."
"roger. we copy. and, finally, i'd like to get a volunteer to take a whack at this - configuring the map camera properly. and it's going to be a few short steps, and if it works, great; we'll have a lot of good engineering data regarding the thermal properties of that beauty. and if it doesn't work, we're just going to turn it off and leave it. and - when somebody's ready to do that, i'll go through the steps. there're not too many."
"okay, joe; somebody'il be ready in just a few minutes. ___ 09 21 38 40 cc roger. thank you, dave."
"okay, houston; endeavour. if you want to try your camera techniques again, let's give it a whirl."
"okay, endeavour. i've got five steps here, and i think it's easiest for me just to read them to you and have you carry them out rather than copy- ing them down. and the first one - first two steps - -"
roger.
"- - on panel 181, verify logic power main a cir- cuit breaker, closed."
"okay, verified."
"and same panel, verify logic power switches, two of them, to deploy/retract."
verified.
"step 3 on panel 278, the experiment covers deploy circuit breaker main a to closed."
verified. closed.
"step 4, on panel 230, the map camera, verify standby."
verified to standby.
"okay, and coming up on step 5 and let me read through this - and - i'll stand by for questions then, if there are some. we want the map camera track to extend; and, simultaneously, we want the exper/ment cover map camera/laser altimeter to open, and we want those two things done simul- taneously."
"okay. understand. go to extend and open the covers, map camera/laser simultaneously."
"roger. and a note on that - i guess - on the map camera track to extend, we'll be watching that for about between 4 and 5 minutes or until you get a gray talkback on there. and - we think this is going to clear up our problem and if it doesn't, we're just going to turn the whole ball of wax off and go ahead and do the eva as normally planned. over."
"okay, joe. in 3 seconds, we'll execute."
"roger, dave. we're watching."
"well, i got a gray on the mapping camera. how about that?"
okay; stand by.
"dave, do you have a gray on the door as well?"
"that's affirmative, but i did not get a barber pole on the door. it just stayed gray."
okay; that's good. that just means that it was open already.
right.
"okay. then that - that's worked out fine. apparently we were having a temperatue prob- lem with that thing before, and we're back in business just like normal. we'd like now the _ mapping camera track to retract, and that '11 take i guess about 4 and a half minutes."
okay. map camera track going to retract now. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
"endeavour, this is houston. be advised that be- cause we're not going to do a midcourse 5, we'll continue the x-ray pointing to about 238 plus 30, and we'll be cc_ing at you with a list of the steps at 238 hours that you can delete because we're not doing the midcourse."
"okay, fine. 09 21 57 _ cc and, dave, could - could you have someone check the barber pole on our map camera, track, to see if you have the gray-retract indication, please?"
"roger, joe, i been watching it. you got about 7 minutes and 20 - 20 seconds now and it's still barber pole. _ 09 21 58 l0 cc okay, that's what we're showing down here. and stand by."
"okay, endeavour, we're satisfied with that mapping camera exercise. two more requests on that. go to off with the extend/retract switch, and to off with the mapping camera/laser altimeter cover switch, please. and we're finished with that. 09 21 58 5_ cdr okay; extend/_ct to off; and a map camera/ lase_ altimeter's going to off."
"that's right, dave. and a note for al. we think that the m,gazine romeo, based on the frame count you gave us, still has enough frames left to take the solar corona pictures. and we'll have some special words for a1 on how he's to take those pictures. i guess, we'll delete a few of the solar corona requirements. also, word about the prd configuration for the eva. apparently, we'll want the cmp to have the prd, whose number reads 25028. and, i guess, that's the one you've been carrying, dave. and, jim, we'll - we'll use the one that reads 08031, but we would like to have him recon- firm this number before he starts the eva. over. tape154/2 09 22 00 lb cdr okay. let me get that in the checklist here, joe; stand by. the cmp is 250 - say again."
"roger. we want a1 to wear the prd that's now reading 25028. that will distinguish it from the other two with no ambiguity. and jim to take the one that begins 080, and we want him to give us the full reading off of that before he starts the eva, though."
"well, we'll have to give it to you now, because it will be in the suit and we won't be able to get to it."
that's fine. any time. any time.
okay. the one jim will wear will be 08037.

"roger. you've got it. 09 22 04 b3 cc endeavour, it's your computer. 09 22 04 s7 _ roger."
"and, houston; endeavour. you want to go through the change in the flight plan at 238 hours, if you haven' t?"
standby.
"okay, dave. this involves delaying the sim bay turnoff until 238 hours and 30 minutes. and in detail, at 238 plus 05, delete the p30 external delta-v, and the verb 49 m,aeuver. lines: at 238 plus 20, delete sextant star check; at 238 _ plus 28, delete all the steps from there starting with circuit breaker scs, et cetera, up to 238 plus 55, ending with rhc power direct (2) - off, et cetera. over."
all right. i got all that. thank you.
"hello, endeavour, this is houston. tape15k/3"
"houston, endeavour. go. 09 22 lk h5 cc be advised at mv ma_k, you are leaving the sphere of lunar influence; end it's downhill from here on in. 09 22 1)4514 cc mark."
"roger. thank you, joe. that's nice to know."
"did you notice anything there, dave? discon- tinuity in velocity or anything like that?"
"well, joe. that's one of the mysteries that we'll probably have to keep to ourselves."
i was afraid of that.
"endeavour, this is houston. _' 09 22 22 02 cdr go ahead."
"roger, dave. we're looking down the l/ne here towards the eva. and the surgeon's getting good hiomed data on a1 now, except one of the three ekg sensors is apparently marginal, and there's some noise creeping in. we're just wondering what your standard procedure is regarding sensor- ing before the eva exercise. if he's going to resensor, it's probably no problem; if he's not planning to, maybe we ought to talk it over a little. over."
"okay. we're all three ail sensored, ready to go. if they have a problem, let's get it squared away right now."
"okay. do you have - maybe a1 could try pressing _ down on the three ekg leads, cue at a time, for us; that may help us out."
okay. here we go. the upper right.
okay. _-_ 09 22 23 22 cdr okay. the upper center is being pressed.
okay.
"okay, and the lower left."
okay. stand by.
okay.
"dave, it looks to us like it's one of the two top sensors, and we were wondering how difficult it would be to reseat both of them now. 09 22 25 i1 cdr okay. i'll tell you what we'll do. a little further down the line here, we'll take care of both of those. we'll ... them and reseat them and everything."
"okay, fine. thank you."
and thank you for thinking ahead on that one.
"endeavour, houston."
"houston, endeavour. go."
"roger. i've got an update to your corona - window calibration photography and the uv photographs, when you're ready."
okay. stand by 1.
"houston, endeavour. can't seem to get the mass spec boom all the way in and i guess al's had a little trouble with it - now and again with the barber pole being half - the talkback being half barber pole. and seems to flutter there, close to the gray position, and doesn't really come all the way in."
"okay, dave. we copy. let us think about that."
"okay. and we're going to go ahead with the dumps, if that's okay?"
okay.
"and if you'd like a visual check of just exactly where that's hanging up, why we can give it to you in a couple of hours. we'll have a1 go out and take a look."
that's not a bad idea. does he know about this plan yet?
"well, i don't know. we'll check with him. yes, he nods his head like he'd probably be obliged to do it."
"okay. break it to him gently, though."
okay.
"and, dave. while i got you here, i do want to c_mment that the first change in the flight plan is to delete the step at 238 plus 23 that says ""enable all jets."" we think that there is a - a _ certain chance that map camera may be stuck out, and we particularly don't want rcs jets a4, a2, b1, and b4 to be enabled, because they may give us trouble with that camera."
"okay. understand, joe. we'll scratch that step and make sure a4, a2, b1, and b4 stay off."
"okay. and i'll - standing by to read you some more photo pads, just at your convenience."
go ahead. i've got the flight plan out.
"okay. if you'll turn to page 3-352, which is the corona window calibration and uv photos procedures page."
i've got it.
"okay. the attitude involved in the corona photo- graphs should read 057, 005, 025. and the time on that, 239 plus 08. and the high gain numbers, pitch, minus 48; yaw, 238."
"okay, joe. 057, 005, and 025 at 239:08. minus 48 ___ and 238 for the high gain."
"that's correct, and moving dowu%a couple of lines, the shutter speed should be changed from ""l/500th"" to 1/125th. and change the inhibit jets line to read ""_,mp rates for 5 minutes."" cmc mode to free."
"okay. understand. scratch inhibit jets, and substitute damp rates for 5 minutes, and then cmc, free, and the 1/125th replaces the 1/500th on the camera."
"that's correct, dave. and moving down a little further, delete the line, cycle i frame, change shutter; and delete the line, ""cycle i frame."" and finally, change the last line, enable all jets to read, ""cmc mode, auto."""
"okay, delete line, ""cycle i frame"" and ""cycle i frame;"" and cmc auto, replaces ""enable all jets."""
"that's correct and assuming you're going to take the uv photographs after the eva, i have a photo pad for that, if that assumption is correct."
"looks like that assumption is probably correct, joe, and we'll take the photo pad later on. let us get on with corona, or we won't mmke it."
"okay, sounds good."
"apollo 15, houston."
"houston, 15. go."
"roger, jim. we understaud you are going to delete the u photograph, but after you complete the corona window cslibration, you will have to do the first step in the uv photos transearth coast procedures, there. and that first step is verb 49 maneuver to earth uv photo attitude, and _ it lists the attitude there. we need this for thermal reasons."
roger. we'll do that.
"houston, 5."
"go ahead, 15. tape15 ,17"
"hey, joe. just a point of clarification on the backing to be used for the corona. i don't know whether you are aware or not, but the backing that fits into window _, which is the right-hand ren- dezvous window, has two different mounting pads for the camera, one is 250 and the other is 80. and the 80 is pointing 12 degrees below the x-axis, and i just wanted to check and see if you wanted us - if that's the proper pad or if you wanted us to use the 80 on the 250 pad."
"al, use the 80. the one pointing 12 degrees above the x-axis."
"okay, joe. thank you. tape155/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"

"okay. sorry, houston, we were getting suited here, and didn't realize we were off comm; but we copied your request. let us think about it some for a minute."
"roger. _ 09 23 52 45 cdr well, houston, i guess that it's a good reason we're about an hour ahead. so we'll go ahead and dig it out."
"that's your choice, dave."
"well, we're sort of ahead, and expecting little things like that to pop up."
fine.
"say, houston, by the way, the lcg you'll get back is the one i wore on the third eva only."
roger; dave. that's fine. that's the one we'd like.
okay. okay.
"and 15, whenever a1 has a quiet moment, i have several prebriefing questions to send up to him about what to look for on the v over h sensor."
"okay, give us about an hour for that, then we'll be able to talk to you. _-_ 09 23 55 12 cc very good."
"15, this is houston. we'd like to have manual on the high gain whenever one of you.has a chance to get there. no need to answer."

"15, this is houston. go ahead."
"we're all suited up and down to the coma check portion of the eva prep, and we're ready to t,k to you about whatever you'd like to talk about."
roger. stand by.
"i guess the main thing we have to talk about is the inspection of the v over h sensor of the pan camera. are you ready to listen, al?"
"okay. he can read you, but he's got to reconfigure his panel in order to talk to you, so we'll do that."
"okay, karl, how do you read me now?"
"loud and clear, al. hey, on this v over h sensor, i have a set of five steps or five questions that we'd like to have for you to have in your mind."
okay. go ahead.
"okay. number i is, inspect the general area this is sort of a general point of view inspect the general area around the v over h sensor and comment on any evidence of thermal or mechanical degradation. and 2, 3, 4, and 5 are sort of more specifically. number 2. is there any evidence of v over h sensor lens cracking, or debris on the lens? in other words, have a good check of the lens itself. num- ber 3. is any large amount of the black paint around the v over h sensor opening missing? number 4. is the plume shield in place around the v over h sen- sor opening? and the plume shield is what i'd gen- erally call the - or - the - it's the guard around - the lens sticking out about 3 inches there. and, number 5. is anything obviously obstructing the v over h sensor field of view?"
"okay, karl. we got all those. _ 10 01 02 29 cc okeydoke. no other special questions at the moment. stand by."
okay.
okay. we'll proceed on here then.
"incidentally, i guess we're - we both understand each other on the status of the mapping camera? so far as you know, it hasn't retracted? is that correct? /"
that is our understanding at this point. i'll let you know when i get out.
roger.
"oh, al. one more point that i overlooked down here, and that is, the people here would like to have you look at the mass spec boom, al, if it's at all fea- sible. if it's not convenient to look down at the base of that boom and look at the coils, forget it; but if you can get a look in there, we would expect to find a coil crossover jamming down in the base there, and we'd like to have your visual confirmation of that."

"roger. just sending up a reminder about the x-ray pointing attitude, which is due very soon _ now, and the activation of the sim bay experiment."
"okay karl, thanks."
"apollo 15, we'd like to have omni alfa."
roger; omni alfa.
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, karl. i'm ready to talk sim bay; but first, a couple of questions."
fire away.
okay. what attitude do you want us to do the uv ._-_ photo - photography at?
"roger, al. the information on uv photos is to follow the procedures - okay - you want the attitudes - the procedure's on page 3-352, and the attitude to be used is 210, 242, 322."
"say the attitudes again, please."
"210, 242, 322. also, note use of magazine p, and also the time - the time that we start the maneu - the time that we finish the maneuver is 247 plus 45."
and let me clarify that magazine. that is the magazine for the uv color for photographs. that is magazine p instead of magazine m.
"okay. understand. use the procedures on _ page 3-352, except change the attitude to 210, 242, and 322, and this whole thing is to be done at 247:45."
roger. that's the time for completing the maneuver.
"well, what time would you like us to maneuver to that attitude then?"
"roger. the time to start the maneuver is 24 - 247 _-_ plus 36. 10 05 43 03 cml i understand. 247 plus 36. roger. thank you, karl."
"okay, al. are you ready for the sim bay questions?"
"roger, karl. sure am."
"okay. first of all, the guys down here would like to send up their warmest congratulations on such an ex - successful eva. you sure made it look easy up there. and the questions. the questions we got are about the mapping camera, and they're directed at the general problem of is there - was there anything you could see which might indicate why it jammed? and there are three - three partic- ular items that you might have looked at. first of all, it was the main camera cover at the bottom of the camera. was it touching or scraping the camera in any way that you noticed? l0 05 44 29 cml the answer to that is negative. in fact, i checked it. i checked the mapping camera cover, laser altimeter cover quite carefully to make sure, because i do know that there have been some interference problems with that before, particu- larly with the pan camera, so i was looking at that in particular to see that it was maybe ad- justed too close or - or interfering along the side of the pan camera, and it was not. there was about half an inch clearance between the upper edge of the cover and the body of the mapping camera, so that i - i don't see that that was responsible for the thing j_mming."
"roger. i think you've very clearly put that suspi- cion to rest. there are also two covers to the solar camera in the upper left side of the mapping camera. and did you notice any - any distortion or any scraping in - in these covers? there's one possibility. the one that stuck out to the left - it - it might have j_mmed and the screwjack that controls it might have twisted it or distorted it. was there anything you noticed like that? l0 05 45 b7 cmp negative, karl. i noticed nothing out of place with the mapping camera, nothing interfering. i checked all the way around it, down into the _ cavity, nothing interfering. i saw no evidence of anything interfering, and it looked clean under- neath, so i don't think there was anything blocking it from underneath. i don't know. my distinct impression after surveying the mapping camera and looking around the cavity where the mapping camera fits was that there is a problem with the drive."
"roger. you didn't see anything inhibiting its motion, not even the electrical cables up on the top, huh?"
"negative, and i guess i can ask a question along that line. has anyone noticed any high current when we've gone to retract on the mapping camera to indicate that it was hanging up?"
"we didn't see any, al, although there had been a long controversy down here about the long amount of time required to extend and retract. it was, even though it was about the 4 minutes predicted several months ago, it was somewhat longer than what we'd observed at the cape. people had been worrying about that for some time."
"yes, i realize that. and i also, as i re - as i go back to what we saw at the cape, there were some problems with that thing hanging up in the drive itself at the cape."
"roger. okay, a couple of questions on the mass spectrometer. you gave us some good information there, but when you said the mass spectrometer cover wasn't completely closed, could you give us some idea at - as - to - to what degree it had _ closed, to what angle, and was - was there any pos - any cocking, any - any twisting in - in that cover?"
"well, i couldn't tell whether there was any warpage in the cover or not particularly because that kind of a cover is a little - looks like it's warped anyway. it looked to me, i could - i pulled _-_ the cover out of the way enough to look at the mass spec inside, and i could see the guide pin and along the sides of the carriage coming through the holes all the way up, so that they were plainly visible from the outside which - which meant to me that the - the mass spec was either very close _-_ to being seated on the carriage or it was seated. i - i guess i don't really know how far those guide pins extend out beyond the - the carriage. the other thing was that the - that the cover - the inconel cover was - it - was rotated about 30 degrees on its - on its hinge point from a full close position. and i thought at first, as i in- dicated when i was there, that there - there looked like there was some interference in one of the outer covers or one of the outer edges, but after playing with that and pulling it a little bit when i was out there, it was quite obvious to me that that wasn't the problem either. and - and beyond that, i couldn't see down around beside the cover enough to tell whether there was something internal between the cover and the mass spec that was - that was binding the cover."
"roger, al. we copy that. and would you open the x-ray and alpha covers right now, please?"
"okay, x-ray/alpha covers coming open."
"okay, i guess you've answered most of our questions on the mass spec, and you've approached one that we might get a little more out of, and that is those guide rails sticking through the guides. there is a tapered portion, and when it's com- pletely seated, you actl,ally see the - the - the cylindrical portion beyond the tapered portion. did you actually see the cylindrical portion, or was it all tapered area that you looked at on the guide rail? 10 05 49 32 cml okay, that's good scoop. all i saw was the tapered area."
"roger. you probably - if it was fully seated, you would have seen about a half inch of - of the cylinder there, and this is a good indication that it was not all the way seated even though it was close."
here's a couple of other questions. give me a second to look at them. lo o5 5o o4 c_ okay. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
"okay, al. mostly questions here about the con- tamination status and things in the sim bay. first of all, how about the - the - the door eder - the door edges? did they blow off smoothly and cleanly?"
"yes, very cleanly. i saw no rough edges at all."
"stand by a moment, al."
okay.
"al, we're anxious to bring up the high gain antenna. i've got a couple of angles here if they 'll help."
okay. f_ 10 05 51 49 cc minus 76 and 117.
"okay, minus 76 and ll7."
"okay. we copied your comment on the sim bay door jettison, and further questions go as follows. the white coatings in the sim bay were - did you notice that any of them why - were obviously dis- colored or - or coated from contamination or over- heating?"
"i saw no evidence of heating in the sim bay. i saw no evidence of discoloration of the white surfaces. there were - (cough) - as - as best i could tell, no particulate matter that had come to rest on any of the surfaces in the sim bay. it looked very very clean. and - even across the top of the mapping camera where there was a - such a heating problem expected, i saw no indications of heating whatsoever, particularly on things like the cover over the mapping camera cassette, which was sup- posedly a very hot spot, and it was just as clean as a whistle. there wasn't - there wasn't any evidence of scorching or contamination anywhere that i could see. tape159/2"
"roger. and, on the insulation and foils, i guess there's a question here - were any of them burned or discolored? you probably already told us that. were any of them torn, or were there any attach- ment failures?"
"no, i couldn't see any evidence of - of any burning or tearing or anything else back there, karl."
"okay, we got one more general question there. and our flights dynamics officer who is vitally con- cerned about our reentry weight would like to know whether we jettisoned more or less than a nominal 32 pounds; and, if so, by how much?"
okay. stand by 1.
"say, houston, we've talked it over and i guess we'd say it was pretty close to a nominal - as far as weight, we have no idea of - of determining exactly what the weight was, but we're going to try and work "" our reentry stowage over this afternoon and tomorrow morning, and we hope to give you a - a plan by - somewhere around noon tomorrow, of where all the rocks are stowed and where everything is stowed and what we have on board. so you can start - so mr. fdo can work up his entry plan."
"roger. and, if somebody has the time to copy it, i've got a small flight plan update available now."
"okay, karl. i'll take that."
"hi, jim. how're you doing?"
just fine.
"okay; 246 hours 20 minutes, we have ""high gain angles of pitch, 00; yaw, 240."" at - -"
... o0 and 240.
"roger. and at 246 plus 46 we want to add ""change discriminator to low."""
"understand. scratch ""discriminator, high,"" and make it ""discriminator, low."" -_"
"that's correct. and, on 247 plus 28, delete that dap load. /_ 10 05 57 20 lmp okay. we already have that change."
"sorry about that. on 247 plus 30, we'd like to have the ""alpha x-ray covers, closed; then off,"" and delete the note on the cover, open, close."
"okay, understand. at 247:30, you'd like ""alpha x-ray doors, closed,"" and to just delete the note here."
roger. and stand by 1 second.
"247 plus 30. also, we would like to add ""mass spectrometer multiplier, high; discriminator, low."""
"understand. at 247:30, you want to add ""mass spec multiplier, high, and discriminator, low."""
"roger. and, at 247 plus 32, we'd like to have ""mass spec multiplier, high; discriminator, high."""
"okay, 247:32, ""mass spec multiplier, high, and discriminator, high."""
"roger. and i guess you need to save room, if there's any left there, because at 34 and at 36, we want to change these two switches again. at 34, we want ""mass spec multiplier, low; discriminator, high."""
"understand. at 34, you want ""multiplier, low; and discriminator, high."""
"affirmative and at 36, we want ""multiplier, low; discriminator, low."""
"okay. at 247:36, it's ""multiplier, low; and discriminator, low."""
"affirmative. also at 247:36 is ""add the uv photos,'! and we've already sent up the changes required for that; the changes over and above what's on page 3-352. and there's one reminder there, and that is to verify that when you use filter 2, that you take one frame for 20 seconds and one frame for 2 seconds. l0 06 00 31 imp roger. we remember that."
"okay. the next step is 247 plus 45, ""x-ray to standby. _'_ _-_"
"okay. at 247:45, ""x-ray to standby."""
"and, at 247 plus 50, we want to move the ptc initiation steps from 247:30 to 247:50."
"okay, understand. the initiation of ptc to be delayed from 247:b0 to 247:50."
"that's affirmative. at 248 hours and 0 minutes, we'd like the following: we'd like the mass spectrometer boom retraction sequence. each retraction step will last 20 minutes, instead of 12. and terminate this test at 249 plus 30."
"go back to 248, karl, on that mass spectrometer boom retraction sequence."
roger. i - -
i have that in there.
"i - i guess all - all we're doing there is changing - the - the retraction step will be 20 minutes instead of 12 minutes. down at the end of the writing there, it says ""each sample period will last 12 minutes."" we'd like to have that at 20 minutes."
okay. i'll change the note there then. it occurs about 248:20; the 12 will be 20.
"that's correct. at 249:05, we'd like to move the mass spec boom deploy from 05 to b0 - from 249:05 to 249:30. ___"
understand. move the mass spec boom deploy from 249:05 to 249:30.
"roger. and one final one at 251:48, which you may already have, is delete the dap load there."
"i do; we have that one, karl."
okay; that completes the _pdate. thank you.
thank you.
"15, houston. we'd like to have gamma ray gainstep up four clicks."
okay. that's gamma ray gainstep up four clicks.
"15, this is houston. we trust you'll be pleased to hear the news that the high voltage has been turned on to the subsatellite, and that they find that all systems are operational."
"oh, that's very good. glad to hear it."
"15, houston. we have a couple of more comments on the uv photo procedures, if somebody can copy."
"go ahead, karl."
"roger. we overlooked the fact that you are taking these photos in the midst of sim bay operation, so a couple of little things change. going back to page 3-352, you can first of all delete, below the damp rates notation, in - you can delete ""inhibit all jets,"" except the jets that are there, and just keep the jet configuration you got right now. l0 07 05 43 _ okay. i copy that. do you have any other comments?"
"roger. under ""remove the cm 5 window,"" put in there ""cmc, free,"" and likewise, about four lines up from the bottom, just above ""note,"" put in ""cmc, auto."" and the final comment, ""enable all jets""; you can delete that. and that's all."
"okay; understand. just below ""remove cm 5 window cover."" put ""cmc, free,"" and then down at the - the bottom there, just above the note, put ""cmc, auto,"" and scratch ""enable all jets."""

"houston, 15."
"15, go ahead; houston."
"dr. parker, i presume. listen, bob, we've got to pull the g-mrna ray to 15 feet at 50, and wonder if you've got an updated retraction time for us."
"that's affirm, al. we have a retract time of 247 plus 50 for 72 seconds. over."
"understand, 72 seconds."
"that's affirm. and, 15, if you've got your flight plan out, we can update a couple more times in that same general vicinity for you."
"okay, the flight plan is out and the door is open."
"okay. at 248:02, the _ass spec boomer track time - that should be 33 seconds. and that time will apply to the first retraction. the second, third, fourth, and fifth retractions will be 32 seconds. over."
"okay, bob. understand that the first retraction i_ 33 seconds and the succeeding retractions will be b2 seconds. is that 4 or 5?"
stand by.
"apollo 15, houston. that will be 32 seconds for all succeeding ones, and we are going to do that up to 249:30. and so all succeeding ones you get will be at 32 seconds. and we will finish that test at 249:b0, no matter where we are. and i believe i see that karl has sent up comment that the sample period would be 20 minutes instead of 12. is that right?"
that's roger; we have that.
"okay. and another change: at 249:b6, the gamma ray deploy. that time will 6b seconds. over."
"copy, 63 seconds."
"okay, that's all we have for right now. _-_"
"0kay, thank you, bob."
"apollo 15, houston. request omni delta, please."
roger. 0mni delta.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
go ahead.
"houston, 15. go ahead."
"roger, 15. if you guys will give us a hack when you start the first mass spec retraction, we'll keep an eye on those 20-minute periods for you."
"okay, good deal."
"bob, we just completed one retraction for 33 seconds."
"okay, we're starting our time."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"go ahead. go ahead, houston."
"roger, 15. we'd like to get a pitch of minus 4.0 and yaw of 90 for the high gain antenna. and then, if you'd change your antenna switch to high gain without hitting the cgmmand reset switch, we'll maintain comm that way, please."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston. _"
"negative, you did the right thing without us calling you. thank you."
"whatever that was, okay."
"15, houston. your rates look good to us for a spin up."
"okay, bobby."
"and, 15, time for the next cycle on the m-_s spec: 32 seconds."
okay. we were a little ahead of you that time.
roger.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"go ahead, bob."
"roger. if you guys are - have a moment free, we'll pass up three comments to you preparatory to some stuff you want to do later on."
"yes, go ahead."
"okay, first is a reminder that we're counting on using the 0ps to pump up the cabin for sleep tonight - another way of bleeding off the 0ps. guess we'll remind you now so you don't stow it away down underneath something where it's incon- venient. and we'd like a read-out on the ops after you finish pumping up the cabin tonight. second comment is a reminder that we'd like a cue on the vacuum cleaner, if you intend to use it for this contamination control period coming up in a half hour or so. and third one is that as far as the medics are concerned, it's dealer's choice on who wears the biomed tonight. over."
"okay. we copied, bob."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. we'd like to confirm auto, auto, off on the 02 heaters. it looks like we've gone beyond the point where they should have come on."
"they're all off right now, bob."
"roger. that explains what we are seeing. roger; we'd like ab_o, auto, off, please."
"understand; auto, auto, off."
thank you.
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, just wanted to clear up the 02 heaters with you. are you aware that the last instruction that we had of the flight plan was at 243:30 that said, ""02 heaters, three off?"""
stand by. that wasn't on my shift.
"you're not the regular crew chief, huh?"
"15 - apollo 15, houston. that callout at 243:30 --' is the 02 heaters for tank 3, only."
"okay, robert. i stand corrected."
that's one i owe you.
"15, you called?"
"negative, negative."
"apollo 15, houston. it's retract time."
"thank you, bob."
"and, apollo 15; houston. it's time to retract again. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription _ l0 09 01 07 _ okay, thank you."
"and, 15, be advised that this is the last retract we'll do. we will not do the fifth retract in order to ensure that we don't damage the filament by getting it in too close. we'll sit in this retracted position for 30 minutes, and then de- ploy the mass spec boom as per the flight plan at 249: 30. over."
"okay, understand."
"apollo 15, houston. about 2 minutes to mass spec boom deploy. and we'd like a delta-t on the length of time it takes to deploy it, please."
"roger, bob."
"bob, the flight time on the mass spec was 3 and 25."
"roger. copied 3 plus 25, jim."
roger.
"apollo 15, houston. while you' re eating your supper there, thought you might be interested in knowing how the vectors are going. your vector and the ground's vector are extremely close, and- at least at the moment. we'll see what happens when we take the next p23. right now, we're looking at no midcourse 6 and about 1.8 foot per second for midcourse 7."
"houston, 15. that sounds pretty good, and it looks like we'll see what happens on the p23. one - you say 1.7 on midcourse 7 is what it looks _ like right now? l0 0g 57 32 cc roger; 1.8. the vectors, i guess right now, are about 4000 feet apart and about a couple of feet per second in velocity and no more."

"roger, dave. that sounds like the size of it to us. we copy all that, and there will be no vector update. ground says your vector is just as good as theirs right now."
"how about that? oh, that's pretty good. we got a good navigator."

"okay at 263:55, we'll add a step there after noun 70, x-ray to standby; and then, at 263:59, we'll delete the verb 48 and also delete the dap load that's in the time colm,mn. _' 10 21 52 18 cc roger. turning the page to 264:02, the dap - load in the time coll-_u should read lll01. and at 265- -"
okay. understand.

"okay. understand that 264:00, in time co_mn, changed the dap load there from all ones to lllo1; and then, at 265, the dap load will be changed the same way to continue for 2 hours. l0 21 5b 43 cc that's correct, jim, and moving on to 266:b0, delete the ""gamma ray gainstep to shield, on"" line."
"okay. 266:30, to - eliminate the gamma ray gainstep. l0 21 5_ l0 cc roger. moving to 267 plus 20, add the two steps: ""gamma ray boom retract, talkback barber pole for about two and a half minutes, then gray, and then off."" and the second step, ""gamma ray gainstep to shield, on."""
"okay. understand, there are two steps there. the first one is gamma ray retract, barber pole for about two and a half minutes, then gray, and then turn it off. the second one is gamma ray gainstep to shield, on."
"that's correct. moving to 267 plus 42, change the dap load in the time column to read lll01, xllll. 0vet."
"understand, from all ones to lll01."
"that's correct. turning the page to 268:02, the dap load in the time coll_mn, the same change."
okay. i copy.
"okay. on the same page, 268:30, gamma ray gainstep, five steps."
"understand, gamma ray gainstep to five steps."
"that's correct, jim. now looking at page 3-378, the ""ltvphotos - transearth coast,"" a couple of changes there. about halfway down the page where it reads ""two frames, filter 2, exposure time 20 seconds,"" delete that line, and add the line - the t_o lines, ""one frame, filter 2, exposure time 20 seconds; one frame, filter 2, exposure time 2 seconds."""
okay. i have that. joe. it's kind of our standard change in the uv procedures. _
"that's correct, jim. and the mag - metro under the ""configure camera"" section should be changed to read mag papa."
okay. understand mag papa.
"okay, jim. and the last one for you, a biggie, turning over 4 pages to the ""sextant photo test,"" strike the line ""pcm cable."""
okay. eliminate pcm cable on - on the sextant photo test.
roger.
can we go back now to the very first one?
"jim, i knew you were going to ask that. the first one, i guess, was a small typographical error, and there's no change required there. and, please don't tell dave about it. he's keeping score against me."
okay (laughter).
"endeavour, this is houston with a forecast weather report for your landing area. they're calling for high scattered - 2000 scattered, l0 miles vis, ! winds about 15 knots out of the east-northeast, waves going to 4 feet, and we're predicting no midcourse 6 correction for trajectory reasons. and from the weather report none is required for weather reasons. over."
"gee, that sounds pretty good, joe. except we saw a movie about that weather stuff once."
"roger. we copy that. and, dave, we do have one question. is it true that nothing can stop the armv air corps?"
"that's true, joe. that's true."
i'm beginning to believe it.
"well, that means you're just about qualified."
"i'm glad you still have reservations, though. your grmma, by the way, is right on 6.5 as close as we can tell right now."
"well, that's pretty good. must be compensating errors along the way somewhere."
"say, houston; 15."
go ahead.
"we reviewed our entry stowage last night. we're going to do the stowing this morning. and in the process, why, we came up with one extra little bag up here, which we're labeling lm return items, which is essentially the same thing as 14 brought back. and i wonder if you might check with our good fido and see if he wants the details of that, or whether maybe ed mitchell can give you the - the general kind of items, and that would be acceptable. but we have one - one bag, which i'm sure you're aware of, and we'll stow it and tell him exactly where we stowed it. and if he wants the details, well, we'll give it to him."
"okay, fine, dave. we copy that, and pass that information along. i have the morning news report, if you're interested in listening."
roger. everybody's hooked up and listening. go.
"roger. this is the news for 6 august 1971. in the first round in theamerican classic at firestone country club, akron, ohio, the leaders are jerry heard and mike hill, both with three-under-par 67's. arnie palmer shot a 70 and nicklaus a 73. the u.s. built its gold medal total to 50 in the pan am games, and theytre entering their second week now. cuba is a distant second with 17 gold medals, but a cuban set a world record yesterday in the hop, skip, and jump. the record was 57 feet 1 inch. we're coming up on the first full weekend of national football exhibition games, and new orleans saints play the buffalo bills; dallas cowboys play the l.a. rams. and these two games are the beginning of an il-game weekend. i've got the baseball scores. american league east: yankees beat baltimore, 5 to o; boston over detroit, 5 to 4, american league west; kansas city over minnesota, 7 to 4; and oakland edged out milwaukee, 2 to 1. the national league: chicago over san diego, 3 to 0; pittsburg beat montreal, 7 to 2; and houston, 0, the dodgers 3. the government reports today the latest figures in the nation's unemployment problem, and one private economist predicts the jobless rates probably will show still another rise. five days after the steel industry and union agreed on a new contract without a strike, tens of thousands of steel workers have been laid off, andthe hearths are cold as users consume steel-strike-preparedness stock piles. william martin, jr., who reorganized the new york stock exchange 33 years ago, proposes an overhaul of the entire securities industry."
"we want to interrupt here. if we could have accept, please, we'll provide you with a new state vector. the senate shelves until september 13that compro- mise draft-extension bill, which nix - president nixon wants now, and when it comes up, it will, quite possibly, face a filibuster. the u.s. middle east expert joseph sisco concludes ""practical and concrete,"" and those are in quotes, talks in israel. he says no decisive breakthrough was achieved, and he didn't expect any. the middle east cease-fire, which went into effect last august 7, hasn't ushered f-_ in peace, but it hassuspended israeli-arab fighting. the last 12 months have been the best year for israel since 1967 and the euphoria induced byresults of the 6-day war. a government study says americans will spend more than 105 billion for medical care in 1974, and even the most ambitious federal health insurance proposal would add less than 12 billion to the tab. congress is set to embark on a month- long s_mmer vacation after the senate completes action on a measure keeping federal agencies in business until october 15. that's good news. and - a - an added word which could be a science update, you may have heard yesterday, but let me repeat it anyway. we've had very clean laser returns off the lr cubed, which is located at hadley base; in fact, very good and _mmediate returns from that. also, as you know, we have a good subsatel- lite orbiting the moon and are getting data from /_- all the experiments onboard that. over."
"oh, that's very good news, joe. thank you. we hadn't heard about the lr cubed, but we were hoping it was superclean."
roger; and it's your computer.
roger.
"and an added note for al. alfredo, i'm not sure if you got a report on your bistatic radar ex- periment. taylor howard got very, very clean echos on both the s-bamd and the vhf frequencies, and he's busy analyzing that data right now."
"very good, joe."
"endeavour, this is houston with a final update con- cerning the trusty lcru on the lunar surface. we turned it on yesterday, and it worked beautifully for about 13 minutes. we w - we were panning around, zooming in and out, got a few more good pictures of the - the surrounding mountains, and suddenly we lost the tm down-link. in fact, we lost everything in a very short time, about 1/60th of a second, almost as though someone had turned it off. we tried - we waited awhile and tried to reactivate it, and did such things as send signals back to it to pan around, while we looked carefully on the passive seismometer for evidence of motion. apparently it was not responding to the signals. the temperatures were completely normal right before it went off the air. we're not exactly sure what happened. over."
"gee, that's interesting, joe. it's - you sh - i guess it completely went off, and just didn't get hung up somewhere, huh?"
"that's right, dave. it wasn't a mechanical problem. we most likely popped a circuit breaker or something like that. it's a little difficult to sort out."
would you like us to go back up and check it for you?
knew you were going to ask. stand - stand by.
"joe, i'm - i'm in - i'm interested in hearing you say that the temperatures were normal. one of the things that - of course, we'll debrief them on it when we get back, but jim and i both noticed that each successive day was warmer than the preceding day. and, on the last day, if you held your hand or something in i position for any period of time, it would really - the suit would really heat up on that particular surface. and i'm surprised that the system ran this long with that temperature up _ there, because i suspect it really got pretty hot."
"dave, that's interesting comment. by normal, i guess i mean within limits. it apparently was about 90 degrees on the lcru and about 90 de - 92 degrees on the camera when it gave up the ghost. however, that's well within its limits, and we don't think that circuit breakers, or whatever, let go because of the temperature. the one thing we did not have sensored, as i understand it, were the - the bat temperatures of the rover that was - that was feeding the power into the tv, however."
"gee, 92 sounds pretty cool to us. i - i would have guessed much - much hotter than that. that's a pretty good thermal system on it, if it kept the temperatures down that low. _ l0 22 20 23 cc that's correct."
"or maybe (laughter) jim mentioned maybe that's centigrade, huh?"
"negative on the centigrade, dave. however, when we turned the camera off at the end of eva 3, the temperature was up around 122 degrees."
"yes, i'd believe that, easily."
"endeavour, this is houston. the surgeon reports that we have good respiratory data from your biomed volunteer, but we have evidence that one of the three ekg leads is open-circuited, either not attached or broken somewhere. and, sometime over the next few hours, we'd like - we'd like you to troubleshoot this for us, please; and, if need be, there is an extra biomed harness in the medicine kit. over."
roger. okay. we'll check into that.
"endeavour, we have the angles."
"roger, houston."
"good ship endeavour, this is houston. we'd like a crew status report at your convenience, please."
roger. stand by.
"okay, joe, i have the crew status. we all got 8 hours sleep. prd readings were - a1 was 25031, and mine was 08042. cons,rm_bles at 261:00; rcs total, 38. quads: 42, 32, 39, and 38. 2: 34, 32, and 33. 02: 49, 50, and 40. over. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription ._' 10 23 09 07 cc okay, jim. thank you."
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
roger. we've resensored the ekg and appreciate a checkout from the docs down there.
roger. stand by.
"good morning, karl."
"good morning, al. how are you doing ?."
just fine.
says the ekg looks good down here. hold 1.
okay.
"al, your new cap comm is just coming up to speed this morning. i understand that there has been a problem with the bicmed harness, and they want to know if the one you have on right now is the one that gave trouble shortly before. l0 23 29 hl cmp that's affirmative. and i did find the loose one."
"okay; we're getting a good signal on you, and i guess that information makes everybody happy down here. thank you. l0 23 29 55 _ okay."
"15, this is houston. we still have a concern _ about your ops pressure and would appreciate it, if it's at all accessible, to have a reading at the present time."
"okay; it's - it's pretty well buried right now, karl. what's your concern on it?"
"well, first of all, they're anxious that the ops pressure be down close to zero at - at entry, and they'd like to figure out how much they're going to use tonight and how much tomorrow night in order ·to bring that down. i guess we don't have it tomorrow night. they're - they're anxious to know _ whether or not it's - we're going to be able to bring down its pressure in using it tonight. _0 23 59 34 cmp okay. i guess it came down to 800 from 2000 last night, but probably came back up. as soon as we get a chance to do some shuffling around here, why, we'll check it and give you a call."
good enough. thank you.
"roger. it's sort of down in the bottom of the pile right now; and we're getting ready to start reentry stowage, so we'll be able to - to get to it in a little while."
we understand.
"al, the way people talk down here, they're going to give you a medal for good sightings up - up there. they say that the - the gamma from this last series of sightings was 6.55, whereas the value we have down here is 6.50."
"roger, karl."
"houston, 15. you may have seen an - an excursion there as we started the verb 49 maneuver to ptc, and we're trying to figure it out, too."
we copy.
what was that?
"15, houston. we didn't see any obvious glitches down here, but we're going to go back and look at the data. --_-"
"okay. what happened was, we were loading noun 22 to the verb 49; and, apparently on the - the last entry, on the third register, we got about a 1-degree-per-second pftchdown pitch rate, and went to scs, and then back to ch - to cmc, and tried it again, and it worked just fine."
roger.
"houston, it looks like we might have got that old ? 22-degree glitch in the cdu."
we copy.
"and, houston, right now, we're reading about 93, 93, and 33_ on the ball."
roger.
"15, this is houston. we feel that we can get rid of that discrepancy if you'll do a verb _0, noun 20."
okay; we'll do one of those.
yes. looks like that's what it was.
"dave, we suspect the cause of that glitch back _ there was possibly due to the fact that you might have loaded a noun 20 instead of the noun 22. is that possible?"
we're thinking. stand by.
"karl, i guess it's a possibility, but we were both looking at it, and i guess we don't think so. but that's a distinct possibility."
"15, houston. about all we can say is that every- thing's looking fine at the moment, and we'll go back and look over the data. we haven't had a chance to do that yet."
"okay. yes. roger. understand. it - it looks fine up here and that - that could have been the problem. ll o0 l_ 19 cdr houston, 15. talking it over, i guess that must have been a - a noun 20 load because, i guess as i remember it, the cdu glitches occur in incre- ments of ll. and ll plus ll doesn't equal 26, i don't think."
okay; we copy.
"and, houston, in our present attitude, a yaw cdu change would be converted to a pitch rate, so that sort of all adds up."
very good.
"15, houston. when you have some time to listen, i have a couple of sentences of cr_ments on the procedure for the - the light-flash experiment."
okay. why don't you stand by until we get our trusty crew all lined up and ready to go.
very good.
"incidentally, dave, as we line them up, one of the changes is that we'd like to keep the cabin lights bright this time."
"oh, you like the lights bright. okay."
"15, houston. we see indications that the optics - aren't zeroed, and we'd recommend that you zero them, with the reminder, of course, to bring the angles down to l0 degrees - less than l0 degrees before you zero them."
"okay; that's - that's standard procedure. we'll get it. thank you. it's even been written up on the panel for about 8 days now, or so."
very good.
"okay, houston. go ahead with your procedure on the light-flash."
"roger. we'd like to have you put the window shades on, as usual, but leave the cabin lights bright. and what we're going to do is to sort of calibrate one crewman in terms of the degree of _-_ a dark adaption required to see the flashes. that would be interesting to know. after you don the eyeshades and give us a mark and go ahead and count things, after a while, you - one of you - and we prefer you, dave, just to be specific - can expect for us to call'up to you to take off the eyeshade for i minute. and after a minute we'll do the timing for you, if you like. we'll tell you to put it back on and, in this minute time, look around at the lights, get back to sort of - your eyes normally adjusted, then put on the eye- shade again, and - and give us marks as you start seeing things. and that's - that's the only dif- ference from the normal procedure. we would - we would prefer to have all - all the data on the voice down link, if possible."
"okay. understand the - open the eyes, and - stand by 1."
"and, houston, we've talked over the - the down link bit, and it's just impractical if we're all going to try and keep up with the cnmments on where and what we see. it would just be too con- fusing for you. and i think - if - if you cannot get your data from the tape, we'll dothat; but i think it's much more practical to go ahead and put it on the tape and just inform you of when we get the marks. _- ll o0 28 05 cc okay, we've had - we've had - we've had some trouble with the tape in the last couple of times around, is the reason the people are sort of saying, ""hey, if we could possibly get it down in real time, we'd feel happier."""
"oh, you - you mean you - you cannot get the data off the tape, huh? ll o0 28 4b cc i guess we've been having trouble with voice quality on the dse, and gerry just now says, ""hey, let's check it right now; see how it's doing."" and we'll let you know in the next few minutes as to what's pref - preferable."
okay. that's a good idea.
"15 this is houston. it looks as though the dse voice down link is acceptable, now; and we'll do it your way."
"okay. let us get squared away here and make sure we get all the shades up and all. ll o0 bo 42 cc 15, one more comment on that dse voice problem. this is, to sc_e extent, dependent on how well _ your mikes are adjusted. so make sure that they're in a good position. t'age1_62"
roger. i guess a down link would probably be the same problem. we'll get them all squared away.
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
how do the rates look for ptc now?
just got the word that they look good for spinup.
okay. ll 00 32 bt cc i think that's another great example of esp at work.
"okay, houston; 15. we're experimenting."
"roger. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription i 1i 00 46 19 cdr houston, 15. we're still here; it just looks like a quiet morning."

roger. i think that'd be a general comment that all three of us experienced.
"and, houston, also, you might note that we all saw flashes last night when we went to sleep - just before we went to sleep, and i guess - we feel like there's a surprising decrease in number and intensity today."
roger. we copy that you feel today's frequency is less than last night's and also that the intensity is less today. ll o1 38 09 cdr. roger. that's correct.

"15, this is houston. we'd like to set your mind at ease about that attitude glitch. it was indeed due to loading a noun 20 in place of a noun 22."
okay. thank you.

roger. that sounds like a pretty good idea. okay; we 'll do that.
roger. and then everybody will be completely satisfied that it's bled out by the time you reenter. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
"15, this is houston with a couple of comments about the sim bay experiments, if you're willing to listen."
roger houston. go ahead.
"first of all, on the gamma ray experiment, dr. arnold reports that a1 worden probably performed the first recorded repair of a scientific instru- ment in space, because earlier in that day he'd begun to experience some problem with excess noise in the gr_ma ray experiment. and when a1 went out in the eva - we don't know what happened there - but at the end of the eva, the gamma ray cleared up and has been doing beautifully ever since. you must have given it a pretty good kick there, al."
"well, not - not only is he a plumber, he's an electrician as well."
"roger. on the x-ray spectrometer, the work you've been doing on the galactic sources of x-radiation has - is already showing considerable interest. and, in particular, the scorpius x-ray i data gives us a longer continuous observation of - of this source than we've ever had before and shows a fairly long-period variation, whi - which - i - with - i should put in a word of caution - which still might be instrumental, but looks real, and was previously unrecorded and has the - has dr. adler rather ex- cited. and i'm sure the other as - astronomers will be much interested also. indeed, we may go back to that source later today, although i don't think that 's clearly decided yet."
roger. that sounds interesting.
"and otherwise, i guess - that - that's about the most exciting news from the sim bay."
"okay. very good. we're ready to talk about entry stowage, if you'll get out your - your map and your little legend there - -"
okay.
- - ... and we'll run down the line here.
"okay. we've - incidentally - one more comment, the mass spectrometer, on the retraction sequence yesterday, showed us no increase in contamination, which was something of a surprise. and it's prob- able that we might try that once more today to make sure that there wasn't some sort of instru- mental difficulty there. maybe we just have a cleaner spacecraft atmosphere than we thought, though."
"yes, from what a1 said when he was looking around out there, it sounded to me like things were pretty clean."
roger.
"okay, 15. if you will turn off your squelch it will help, because we may occasionally have periods in - when coremis rather weak. and, otherwise, go ahead. ---"
"okay. what - what we use as a reference is the entry stowage map, spacecraft ll2, 26 july 71, which is in the front of our flight plan. and, if you have that in front of you, why, i'll just go through that and give you the additions, dele- tions, and changes, of which there are very few."
okay. we're - stand by one moment.
okay.
okay. go ahead.
"okay. a-1 is stowed as prescribed there. top of a-1 has a bag - a decontam bag in which we have sample container number 2, for 23 pounds, and the i_ return items."

"top of a-7 is sample collection bag - 0h, stand by."
"okay. let me - let me go back and make a correc- tion here, karl. look over in the left-hand column where it says top of a-l, and scratch ""sample col- lection bag number 2."""
okay.
"and then go back to your right-hand col_mn there. on top of a-7, we have decontam bag with sample collection bag number 2 and the bslss bag, for a j_' total of 48 pounds."
we copy.
okay.
"could i clarify that - both of those bags together were 48 pounds, or do i also put over the 20 - the 23 pounds we had on a-l? 11 0b 16 35 cdr no, the total of collection bag number 2 plus the bslss is 48 pounds."
i understand.
and you can scratch the collection bag number 2 for 23 off of a-1.

say again.
"okay. i - i figured that would be a strange one. on the side of a-8 in bag, there are four items there, and one additional item has been added. the drill core-stem, which we just labelled as a core tube pole, because it looks like a pole."

"u-2 will have the items listed, plus the accessory bag, in which we have - the contaminated gloves. and i'll read you a list of those items, if you are ready to copy. i1 03 20 29 cc okay. go ahead. 11 ob 20 33 cdr have one set of ev gloves and one set of iv gloves, the tethers - the - the waist tethers, paper towels. and i guess that's about it."
"roger. _ ll 03 20 51 cdr u-3, it's as you have prescribed there."
roger.
"stand by l, karl."
"okay, houston. ready to go with the right-hand column. u-4 is as perscribed sic, and r-2 is as perscribed sic."
roger.
"okay. the pga bag is as perscribed sic with the following additions. first we have - in - in the bag where we'll put the lunar sample - we'll have r-12, with the csm malfunctions procedures and systems book."
we copy.
"and the lunar sample is bag number 7, for 24 pounds."
roger.
"okay. and then, everything else is as perscribed sic. and the cmlpga will be in the sleep re- straint under the right-hand couch with two tsbs, which are now acting as waste containers."
roger. and that - that location was where again?
"underneath the right-hand couch, strapped down as - as it's perscribed sic. we just wanted to note that, within that sleep restraint with the pga, will also be two tsbs."
roger. we copy.
"and that's just light waste material in those tsbs. and i guess that pretty much takes care of it, unless you have any questions."
"thank you, dave. we copy all of that."
"okay. and, as you go through it and look it over, if you have any questions or anything you'd like us to shuffle around, why, let us know."
okay. we sure will. thanks.
"15, we have your torquing angles."
ro - roger. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
"15, this is houston. the next several attitudes are going to require us to use omni delta, and we suggest that you go manual and wide and stow the high gain antenna."
okay. we'll do that and go to omni delta.
"apollo 15, this is houston. we'd like to have you retract the mass spectrometer boom for 85 seconds."
understand. retract the mass spec for 85 seconds.
"that's affirm, and then we'll leave it there for about 5 minutes. we'll cue you when to extend it again."
okay.
"15, this is houston. would you please extend the mass spec boom all the way out again."
roger. in work.
and i have a t-start for the lunar eclipse photo's when you're ready to copy.
okay. go ahead with the t-start.
t-start for lunar eclipse photo's. 268:59:47.
"understand, 268:59:47."
"that's correct, al."
"al, we had a question on the mass spectrometer and t_ it may be too late. was it possible to confirm by visual look through the window that it was retracted?"
"negative, karl. you can't determine that it's retracted. all you can determine is that it's full out."
"roger. well, when it was retracted, you wouldn't be able to see it. that's what i'm asking. is it possible for you to take a look now and see if it slowly comes in to view?"
"roger. in other words, you're asking to a con- firm that it does come full out."
that's correct.
okay.
"just to clarify our question, al, the main ques- tion was just to confirm whether or not it did go out of your field of view. did it actually move from the full - from the full-extended position? since we saw no change in the data when we re- tracted it during the test yesterday, there is a suspicion that, even though you actuated the switch, that for some reason it didn't retract. ll 04 27 26 c_tp understand. okay. it's fully extended now, karl. but it may be too late. it may have already been out by the time we looked."
roger.
"15, this is houston. we have a rather extensive update to the flight plan. and also, a change to the procedure for the contamination of photos, which we can read up to you at your convenience. li 04 37 09 cmp okay. does it involve the things going on here in the next couple hours?"
it - it's pertinent beginning at 271. we probably ought to get it in before the press conference at 270.
okay. stand by 1.
"okay. go ahead, karl."
"okay. if you've got the flight plan out, we go over to 271 hours. and at 271:20, just under s-band ox tv science, we add v_b 49, maneuver to contamina- tion photo attitude. the attitude is 014, 195, 016; high gain, pitch, minus 23; yaw 252."
"okay. at 171:20 sic just after s-band ox tv science, verb 49 to 014, 195, 016, high gain, pitch, minus 25 - 23; and the yaw, 252."
"roger. just after that, we delete mass spectrometer ion source, off, and in the space there add configure for urine dump."
"roger. delete the mass spec and ion source, off, and configure for urine dump."
"okay. delete the next one, two, three, four lines, but we - and that brings us to gamma - gamma ray, gainstep, shield off, which we leave in."
"roger. delete four and leave in the gas_4a ray, gainstep, shirld 0ff. go. 1t 04 39 48 cc delete all of the rest of that page. and add at 271:40, verb 48, 11101, 01111, and p52, option 3."
"okay. 271:40, verb 48, 11101, 01111, and at p52, option 3."
"roger. and at 271:45, we add gamma ray boom. d_oy, 4'_econ_$, _hen-off.-ga_94a ray, gain- step, center, anti,start contamination photos."
"okay. 271:45, gamma ray, boom deploy, 41 seconds, then off. gamma ray gainstep to center. start the contamination photos."
"and there's a note on the photos that you begin to dump according to the photo procedures, which are - i have an update to that i'll give you later. and that we dm_p the water to 40 percent, in order to have the right weight at entry. roger. it's important that we don't go below 40 percent on _-_ the water dump. ll 04 42 o1 c_ okay. understand. dump according to photo proce- dures and the water dump to no less than 40 per- cent for entry, 11 o_ _2 08 cc that's affirmative. on the next page, 272 hours and 00 minutes, we - i - i presume you know that _' we're not doing the midcourse correction 6. we cancelled the p52 there. and we keep the h2 purge line heater on, but we cancel the p30 external delta-v. we cancel the verb 49 maneuver, we --_ cancel the next one, two, three, four, five, all the way down to the h2 and 02 fuel cell purge, which we keep."
"okay. understand. keep the h2 purge line heater, cancel the p52, and the set of lines below h2 line heater on, and keep the h2/o2 fuel cell purge."
"roger. and at 272:28, a note that you should be ending the contamination photos at that point."
say again.
2- 272:38.
"okay. 272:38, end contamination photos. go ahead."
"right. at 42 we cancel - we delete the waste-water dump, since we've already done it. and at 42 we add: ""start the mass spec boom test,"" and the pro- cedures are to be read up in real time. at 58 we cancel the mideourse 6."
at 273:01 we - -
"okay. at 272:47, that's the - hold on. let me read it back. 272:42 the mass spec boom test procedures in real time, and cancel mcc-6. go ahead."
"roger. at 273:01, we cancel the burn status re- port and we add: ""x-ray experiment on. alpha x- ray covers, open, and record the get."""
"okay. 273:01 x-ray experiment on, alpha x-ray covers, open, and record the get. go ahead."
"roger. at :03 we delete the gamma ray, x-ray, alpha particle, m80, on. and down at 273:47, we add gamma ray, boom, deploy."
"okay. a deletion at 273:00 - or :03, the four items there and then ga_ ray, boom deploy at 273:47. go ahead."
"roger. and one final item on 274:05, in the mass spectrometer instructions there, the dis- criminator should be low instead of high."
"okay. 272:04 sic mass spec, discriminator, low vice high."
"roger. and if you have the time, i can give you the update on the contamination photography, which is on photo 25 and 26 in the back of volume i of the flight plan."
"stand by l, please."
"okay, houston. let's hold off on the updates of those other photos, so we can get squared away for the eclipse photos."
roger.
"15, this is houston. your astroncmer cap comm is _ getting curious to know whether you are seeing anything of the lunar eclipse. anything visible?"
"oh, sure, we've seen it come down to about half to about 1/sth illumination at the present time, relative to the sun's illumination."
"roger. and what percent of the disk is covered now? ll 05 13 35 _ stand by. ll 05 15 47 _ okay, karl. looks like about 9/10ths of the disk is covered at the present time, and we've been taking the pictures all along. it's a very pretty sight out there."
"roger. sounds like you are getting close to total _-_ eclipse there. hey, we note down here that in your free mode you are drifting somewhat in pitch and you are about 5 degrees off now. the recommendation is to go auto and stop the drift if you can and cycle back to free before you take your next photo. if there is anything you can do to correct the pointing it might be a good idea."
"okay. right now the photos are handheld, so we'll get to it when we get to the nikon."
okay. _
"houston, 15. the moon's in the shadow now and we have a variation in color from a almost a light gray to a burnt orange from one side of the moon to the other. _lmost like the old harvest moon, except that i'm not sure there's any atmosphere up here yet."
roger. we copy.
"houston, 15. we've finished the photos, and a1 had the moon in the reflex part of the nikon all the way, so i'm sure the pointing was okay."
very good.
right now the moon is sort of - varies from sort of a very pale orange to a good deep burnt orange on one side and a very gradual change. and i hope the - the photos come out because it - it certainly is pretty.
very good. it sounds like a beautiful view from up there. you've seen a lunar eclipse of the moon twice as big as anyone else has ever seen such an eclipse.
"that was very interesting, and it certainly is a - a pretty view. it'd be a- a great place for sombody like you to come up and use your trained eye to interpret all this and understand it."
"sounds like it would be fun, someday."
"i see you have your e_ entry check coming up. if there is any chance of my slipping in this change of procedure on contamination cloud photog- raphy i'd be pleased to - at this point. ll 05 26 42 _ okay, give us a couple of minutes to reconfigure here. we'll have time to do that."
"okay, fine. i'll stand by for your word. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay, houston. go with the contamination cloud photography update."
"roger, dave. are we on photo 25?"
photo 25. go.
"okay, the reason for this change is that we have to use the dac, instead of the nikon, since we've run out of nikon film. the first change is under procedure - l, configure camera; we go down to the second line in the cm 4, et cetera, we - we x that out, and we substitute - cm 4 - - 11 05 31 4_ cdr stand by 1, karl. we want to find out if we have any more nikon film. we may have some. _-_ 11 05 31 58 cc okay."
"15, houston. our records show that you will be out of nikon film when you finish the lunar eclipse photography, and we'd prefer that you use it for the lunar eclipse."
does that include mag w?
stand by.
"oh, disregard that. we just found a - a little note on mag w, it says ""do not load in camera."" i guess that takes care of that. go ahead with your update."
"okay, fine. the basic specs there in - are - we're using window 4/dac - d-a-c/18/vhbw-bracket, m-i-r for mirror, pcm pic cable. (ti, 1/1000, infinity), 24 feet per second."
"okay. dac/18/vhbw-bracket, mirror, pcm cable, t1 1/1000, infinity, and 24 frames per second. go."
"correct. the next line, it's magazine h, maga- zine hotel, and magazine - and instead of frame number, it's magazine percent to be filled in there. tal_,174/2 'age 1480"
roger. hotel and percent. go.
"okay. completely delete number 2, and substitute instead the following: ""utility power, on; cover _ lens; dac, on 2 seconds."" change shutter to ""1/60;"" change frame rate to ""time."""
"okay. ""utility power, on; cover lens; dac, on 2 seconds,"" change shutter to ""l/60th,"" and frame rate to ""time,"" in place of the number 2 you have. go ahead."
"roger. in step 3, we delete ""inhibit all jets,"" and, at the end, we add ""cmc node, free."""
"roger. delete ""inhibit all jets,"" and add ""cmc mode, frw.v? at the end. g ahead."
"roger. at the - at the end of step 4, before ""repeat 4-frame sequence,"" we write ""cmc mode, auto."" and we delete ""repeat 4-frame"" - -"
...
"we - we - we - we delete the ""repeat 4-frame sequence."""
"okay, step 4. add ""cmc auto"" and delete ""repeat 4-frame sequence."" go ahead."
"roger. step 5. instead of t plus 6 plus 6:30, we - it's t plus 3:30, 3 plus 30. dump waste water - -"
roger. t plus 3:30 vice t plus 6:30.
"roger. and it says ""waste water or urine,"" it's really ""waste water and urine ."" the - and we dump --"
and vice or.
"go ahead, and - okay, and we dump to 40 percent as you've been previously advised. also a part of 5, add ""repeat step 4 (damp rates)."""
"okay. in step 5, add ""repeat step 4 and damp rates."" go."
"step 6, the time there is not 26 plus 30, but it's 28 plus 30. also - -"
roger; 28 plus 30 vice 26 plus 30.
"roger. at the bottom, we delete ""repeat 4-frame sequence,"" and we add the following: ""t plus 32 plus 0; cmc mode, auto""; and below that ""repeat step 4 (damp rates)."""
"okay. at the end of step 6, can - cancel ""repeat _-frame sequence,"" and add ""t plus 32 plus 0; cmc, auto;"" and then ""repeat step 4 and damp rates."""
"roger. on step 7, it's ""t plus 43"" instead of 48; and, at the end, delete ""repeat 4-frame se- quence,'' and add ""cmc mode, auto."""
"okay. step 7 is ""t plus 43,"" and delete the ""repeat 4-frame"" and add ""cmc, auto."" go."
"roger. step 8. we delete ""enable all jets,"" and what we record is the magazine percent. and that's the end of the correction."
"okay. step 8, delete ""enable all jets,"" and add percent instead of frames."
roger. that's got it.
all righty; we'll do all those.
"15, this is houston. sorry to tell you, but i made a couple of errors in that read-up. can we make it two corrections?"
"okay. stand by l, please, karl."
"okay, karl; where are the corrections?"
it's photo 25.
"okay, i'm on photo 25. tape 1?4/4"
"right. at the end of step 5 and step 6, i put in a little statement ss_ing ""repeat step 4, damp rates."" that's really meant to say, ""repeat step 3,"" which is ""dsmp rates,"" in both cases."
"okay, understand."
"15, houston. ll 05 45 50 cml go ahead, karl."
"guys, at the end of photo 26, when you get through with this sequence, requesting 2 seconds of pro- tect frame also."
okay. i - -
"okay, got you."
"15, houston. have a lunar eclipse photo pad on your flight plan, page 384, when you're ready."
"stand by, dick."
okay. i'm ready to copy the photo pad on the lunar eclipse.
okay. 270:49:53.
roger. 270:49:53.
roger.
"15, we'd like to have omni charlie."
omni charlie.
"15, houston. we'd like to get the high gain up, pitch, 22; yaw, 261."
stand by; we're maneuvering.
"okay, houston. are your high gain angles for the sextant photos or for the lunar eclipse photo attitudes ?"
"sorry about that, dave. when you complete this maneuver, they're in your flight plan, fitch, minus 22; yaw, 227."
roger.
"15, we'd like to have 0mni bravo."
0mni bravo.
"15, houston. give us auto and narrow on the high gain, please."
roger. auto and narrow.
"houston, 15. you ready down there?"
"roger, 15. we're close to ready. are you ready for the big press conference?"
"roger. we're ready. anytime you want to go to transmit, let us know."
"okay, you can go ahead to transmit."
roger.
"hey, 15, we're getting a beautiful picture coming through."
. roger. go ahead with your questions.
"roger. we'll - we'll admire the beautiful picture for - for a few minutes here. deke just passed out from the shock, incidentally."
"okay, fellows, i have a preliminary statement to make here. the questions you will be asked in this news conference have been submitted by newsmen here at the manned spacecraft center who've been covering the flight. some of the questions they raised have been answered in your c_mmunications with - with mission control, but the public at large has not necessarily heard them. the ques- tions are being read to you exactly as submitted by the newsmen and in an order of priority specified by them. question number 1. since last week, we have shared scores of exciting moments with you. which single moment would you most like to live again, and is there any moment which you would never like to repeat?"
"well, i guess we all probably have a different idea on which would be the single most exciting moment of the flight, and maybe we'll just run through it one at a time. i guess the most im- --_ pressive moment i can remember is standing up on hadley mountain, hadley delta, and looking back at the plain and seeing the lm and the rille and mount hadley, and the whole big picture in one - one swoop. and i think we've got same pictures for you from up there, and i believe the tv was running at the same time, and i think that was probably the most impressive sight that i've ever seen. al."
"i guess i'd have to say - sort of, two events occurred which were exciting for different reasons, and i guess they were really kind of the highlights of - of the flight for me. one was, right after loi, when we got our first look at the moon, and it was a fantastic, spectacular sight. and the other, i guess, was when tgi burned so beautifully, and right after tei, that was an awfully good feeling."
"okay. well, i guess there were a great many new thrills for me, and the one that was most im- pressive though was the lift-off. it began the flight, and i knew that i w_s going into space after a few years of waiting and training. and then, as far as the event that i would not like to - to repeat again, was probably the time when i fell down in front of the tv when we were deploying the rover."
"question number 2. near spur crater, you found what may be genesis rock, the oldest yet collected on the moon. tell us more about it."
"well, i think the one you're referring to was what we felt was almost entirely plagioclase or --_ perhaps anorthocite. and it was a small fragment sitting on top of a - a dark brown larger frag- ment, almost like on a pedestal. and jim and i were both quite impressed with the fact that it - it was there, apparently waiting for us. and we had hoped to find more of it, and, i'm sure, had we more time at that site, that we would have been able to find more. but i think this one rock, if it is, in fact, the beginning of the moon, will tell us an awful lot. and we'll leave it up to the experts to analyze it when we get back, to determine its origin."
"question number 3. apollo 15 is already being described as one of the great events in the history of science. aside from the crystalline rock, what other findings at hadley-apennine seem most im- portant to you? ll 06 27 06 ib5 i guess, immediately, i think of the orientation or organization that was revealed in the side of mount hadley. there's 14,000 feet vertical relief of vast mountain face exposed to us. and there was layering in there that was most impressive for the total 14,000 feet, and we commented on the number of beds we could see. that really impressed me, that you could have that much organization in - on a large mountain on the moon."
"question number 4. this is the toughest landing area we have attempted to - to reach on the moon. describe what it was like, flying into it."
"well, i think, to begin with, we had every con- fidence that we could get to the landing site. the trajectory had been modified such that we had ade- quate clearance over the mountains. and the first sight i had out the window was somewhere around probably 9 or 10,000 feet as we passed down below the upper elevations of mount hadley. and i could see mount hadley to my left before we pitch - pitched over and saw the - the plain at hadley, and that was probably as impressive sight - a sight as i've seen. the landing itself, once we pitched over, was somewhat of a surprise in that the - the craterio_ was much more subtle than we _-_ had expected. there was a great lack of any large fragments or boulders on the surface. it was ap- parently quite smooth, and those rather deep craters which we had anticipated using as landmarks because of their subtlety did not appear quite as readily as we had hoped. i think we did recognize our relative position east-west of the rille be- cause of the size of the rille itself. i think we were a little off on the north-south, but close enough to handle the traverses in the rover. i think that having a vehicle such as that - as that enables us to go into more cgnplicated, difficult landing areas because it's not necessary to land on an exact point. we can take advantage of our mobility and land anywhere within a certain prescribed area which was initially our goal on this flight."
"question number 5 for a1 worden. in lunar orbit, you too carried out geologic observations; for example, you reported cinder cones. could you discuss this and other observations from 60 miles up?"
"yes. the c_mment on the cinder cones was one df color, but we noticed particularly on - on some of the lighter part of the back side that many many of the craters that we flew over were filled with what appeared to be lava. there seemed to be a great number of lava flows in the - in the mare area, particularly mare imbrium. mare imbrium -- seems to be a- just a - countless numbers of - of lava flows, which were all apparently very thin and very fluid. and you can see - you can just count number - numbers of flow fronts covering mare imbrium. so we got, i think, quite a distinct impression of a - of a - of a great deal of vol- canism around the moon. and, in same particular isolated area such as the littrow area and such as areas like probably the aristarchus plateau, there's a great deal of volcanism and some cinder cones and - and certainly a lot of lava flows."
"question number 6. do you feel that the workload during your three lunar-surface excursions was too demanding? you appeared at times to be reaching the limit of your endurance. any recommendations for apollo 167 ll 06 b1 24 cdr i think anytime you set out on a task such as the one we had, you're bound to, at certain times, get a little tired, which i think we probably did. however, i think we came back and i don't think we ever reached anywhere near the limit of our physical endurance. i think apollo 16 probably has everything in hand; it's just a matter of conditioning yourself. jim and i have discussed it since we got back onboard the endeavour and concluded that our training is what really pre- pared us, and the many hours we spent during geology field trips and in simulations at the cape in our suits, we feel, was the factor which really contributed to being able to proceed with those duration evas. i see no problem in the future with conducting three successive 7-hour evas. neither one of us were particularly physically tired. i think the fatigue is really in the - the mental regime, in which you're concentrating very intensely for 7 hours, and you're pressing to do your best all the way through and - and keep your eyes open to make the appropriate ob- servations and gather the samples. and i think it's really more of a mental factor than a physical factor."
"question number 7. you described the lunar rover as a bucking bronco on the moon. would you elaborate and assess the rover's performance and tell us what changes you recommend for the 1972 model? ll 06 33 13 iaip well, there were several times there when we were riding along where we'd hit on a sizable bump and you could - you could see the - the wheels come off the ground and then float through the air and - but dave should c_mment more as far as the - the driving. and it was really like a bucking bronco, that's true, because i was strapped in. as you know, dave had to strap me in because i had some trouble with my seatbelt, but i - i really did feel like i was on a - a bucking bronco."
"i think i might add that it's a - it's a very stable machine, but because of the - the 1/6th gravity, it tends to float. in - in the simula- tions we ran in houston, we saw the same amplitude or the same degree of bouncing but a different damping. in other words, the - the vehicle would come off the ground, or one wheel normally would come off the ground, and it would take it some- what longer to return to the ground than in one g. and i think it's just a matter of being - becoming accustomed to the to - driving. it's a very stable vehicle; the suspension system - system is excel- lent. we had to make some rather sharp avoidance turns periodically, and in - in these turns, we could tell the vehicle was quite stable. no tend- _ ency to turn over whatsoever. i think the only recommendation we'd really have would be to come up with a new idea on the seatbelt-type arrange- ment, and we -we've discussed that also. i think we have some suggestions we could make when we get back to ensure that you can have both crewmen securely in their seats in a short period of time. other than that, i think the vehicle is about as optimum as you can build."
"question n_mber 8 for dave scott. the drill seemed to drive you up the crater walls. what was the problem, and was it worth the time?"
"i guess i'd anticipated that question. i think the problem was a - a striking discovery. when we went to hadley rille, we expected to find a regolith, or the soil, about 5 meters thick. and with that in mind, like 25 feet, i expected to have no trouble putting the heat flow probes in or dril- ling the - the core stem because of the expected soft soil. after about 1 meter, i ran into hard rock, and my first thought was it was an isolated rock somewhere within the - the soil. but that was not the case. apparently, what we have is a very thin regolith or a thin soil layer above solid rock. and with this in mind, i think we brought back a core stem or a deep drill-core of the moon of basic bedrock or foundation rock on hadley plain. i think that's a very significant find. i think it will be very meaningful to the scientists when they analyze it. the perplexing problem was doing the actual drilling and extracting the core stem. if you put a drill into solid rock, it's very diffi- cult to get it out, and there at the end, it took both jim and i with our shoulders pushing, as hard as we could, up - to extract the drill stem. but in the final analysis, as i look back on it, i think it is indeed worthwhile. at the - at the time it occurred, we were both interested in mov- ing out to the - the northern complex and further geology, which jim and i are both quite interested in. and the mechanical task of doing the drill at that time seemed what - somewhat less important than seeking new - new finds in a new geological area. but, in retrospect, i think we have, in fact, brought back one of the most significant samples of the whole trip."
"question number 9 for dave scott. in view of your comment to geologist leon silver about the need for trained scientists on the moon, do you think that scientist-astronaut jack schmitt should be included in the crew of apollo 17, the last of the apollos ?"
"well, since i really have very little say-so as to which - which people get selected for which crews, i might sort of bypass it with a - with one com- ment that i think the more qualified a man is on the moon, the more results you're going to get. and i think that's one of the reasons that we put as much time as we did into the geological aspects, in hopes of - of learning enough to bring back some significant data. i think that in any situa- tion such as this, in any scientific endeavour, that you want the most qualified people possible. you must also remember that this is a - a highly complex operational mission. it requires a great deal of - of training and skill in order to fly these machines. i think, in particular, jack schmitt is a very highly qualified individual in both as- pects. and i believe it's up to the - the manage- ment, that when they select the crews, to select the best people for the flight."
question number l0 for a1 worden. what runs through the mind of a man orbiting the moon alone?
"well, i guess - i guess the - the thing foremost in nv mind during those b days was how i was going to keep up with the time line and the flight plan, and how i was going to keep track of all the ex- _-_ periments we had going and where they were, and - and whether they were operating or not. and i guess that was a very, very fast b days for me. when i wasn't looking at the sim bay experiments, i was looking out a window and taking pictures, and it was a pre_tty cr-mmed 3 days. as a matter of fact, i - i guess i didn't really have - have much time to give any thoughts to being alone up there. ljage1490"
"question number 11, again for al. you said, after your spacewalk, you wish you'd stayed out longer. what was it like out there between the earth and the moon, and why did you come in so soon?"
"well, let me answer the last one first. i - i guess i didn't come in soon; i came in when the job was done. and, as a matter of fact, i made an extra trip back out to take a look at the map- ping camera. now as - as far as what i felt like when i went out there, we talked a little bit about if after - after the eva and decided it was sort of like walking on stage at your high school - dinner dance or something. we opened the hatch and it was pitch black, and as soon as we got out, the sun was beating down on everything, and it looked like a very lamge floodlight on a stage. and then putting the tv camera out on the door just added a little bit more to that sort of un- real feeling that it was time to get out on the stage and do something. i think, as far as the eva went, we did it just almost exactly as we'd practiced it. it took almost exactly the same amount of time; we did it the same way. and, of course, we had practiced that with pan - with the mapping eaw_ra in the extended position, and so that - that really posed no difficulty to us."
"question number 12 for dave and jim. you - you didn't have time to get to north complex, craters which m_y have been formed volcanically and where you thought some surprises might be found. was this a significant loss?"
"well, i'll start out and - and throw an answer there. i think if you look back at the original requirements for the landing at the hadley- apennines, they were primarily to inspect the front and the rille. it was only after a - a consider- able amount of study had been done and some re- arrangement in the flight plan - the timing on the surface, that we found we had enough time to plan to go to the northern complex. so the northern complex was, in fact, an addition to the original requirement; it was bonus. and i think because jim and i have spent so much time with volcanics in our terrestrial geology work, that we were quite interested in getting to the northern complex to see if, in fact, it was a volcanic area. but i don't believe we lost anything from the lunar sur- face by not going there; only we would have had an /_' extra bonus had we been able to reach that point. and, with that in mind, i hope that some day some- body gets a chance to go back and take a look at the northern complex. jim, do you want to answer?"
"no, i agree with everything you said. it was just a little personal disappointment that we couldn't get up there, because we - we thought we'd have another beautiful view of the - the plains there and the i24,a view almost as beautiful as it - as it was from the side of hadley delta."
"question number 13 for each of you. would you, please, in your own words, tell us what you gave the american taxpayers besides a few hours of good television?"
"well, i think - the magnitude of the scientific '-'-'"" data we return will speak for the taxpayers' money. the small amount of time they had for television, i think, is rather insignificant relative to the amount of return we've gathered in the sim bay and in the lunar samples we have aboard right now. i think these data will not only en - enhance the progress of science, but it will reach the common man on the street directly by the - the byproducts of what we learn. i think man must extend himself, the new frontiers must be open in order for us to - to propagate m_nkind, and i think this is one way in which we do it. i - i feel that the taxpayers got, probably - as a matter of fact, i hope they got more than their money's worth out of the flight. and, if you could see the size of the film maga- zines that a1 brought in yesterday from those ca- meras, why, you'd see that we have indeed at least a great deal of data on film alone."
"well, i really guess that there's not much to add to what dave said. he - he expressed my sentiments exactly, in that the - the knowledge that, hopefully, we've - we've added to our store of information about the moon and about ourselves will be increased in an extent which is greater than - than the - /_., than the capital that was - spent on the flight itself. and i would certainly think that - that the full theory adds significantly to - to man's knowledge about h_qelf primarily and about h_m_elf in those areas where it will help future genera- tions maybe. -_"
"i can only add that we're bringing back just a lot of - lot of data and a lot of material, and it's going to take many years for people to really appreciate how much was gained from - from this flight."
"question number 14. it seemed this flight has as many problems as some of the old gemini missions. which of these gave you the most concern; and, for dave, did you ever feel you were back on gemini viii?"
"well, i guess we weren't aware we had that many problems. i thought this was a rather trouble- free flight, myself. we went a long way, we spent a long time doing the job, and i think, relative to the number of systems we have in all the space- craft, that we had very few problems. i can think of none that were significant that would enable me to compare it with gemini viii at all. we had a - i guess the first little problem we had was a - a leak in our water system, which was cleared up rather rapidly by somebody having already done some investigation and having a procedure at hand. i believe our system is such that people have all the anticipated problems understood, and, when they have them understood, they come up with solu- tions which are quite meaningful and successful. and i feel like the spacecraft and the life-support systems on the moon and everything worked exceed- ingly well. i - i guess really i couldn't ask for much more. how about you?"
"you know really, we had very few problems. it seemed like a very tame simulation, as far as i was concerned. certainly, there were - there were - there were irritating things that happened like some circuit breakers in the spacecraft here that gave us some trouble, and some lights that aren't working exactly right. but certainly none of the important aspects of the flight or - or none of the essential pieces of equipment have malfunc- tioned, and i think it's been just great."
"gentlemen, we'd like to continue the press confer- ence in a few minutes. but, in the meantime, we'd be anxious to get - start - get one of you started on the lunar eclipse photos. we have three more questions. question - -"
okay -
"question number 15 - for dave and jim. how many times did each of you fall down on the lunar sur- face? did any of these falls hurt you or give you any problems? ll 06 47 57 _ well, i fell down twice, and it was never any real problem. actually, i could have got up very well by myself without any help."
"yes, i guess i fell down twice, too, and, as jim said, it was never any real problem. it's a matter of if you start to go - and, of course, the terrain there, i guess you could see in the television, was quite rough and irregular with occasionally rocks around, and we were pressing to try and get things done. and it was just a matter if you just start losing your balance, to go ahead and go easy, and accept somewhat of a - a light fall. because of the 1/6th gravity, there was never any impact when we hit. take it easy and get up slow. and i don't think either one of us ever came anywhere near the point of being hurt, in that sense of the matter, it's just a matter of slowing you up for a minute, enabling you to re- gain your balance, and go ahead. and i - i have a question. do you want to have the photos of lunar eclipse with the television now, or do you want us to get on with the - tha camera photos? because if that's the case, we have to turn the lights out in here."
"roger. we're going to skip down to the last question, dave, which says your cabin must be jammed with moon rocks, core samples, suits, and assorted hardware. can you show us what it's like in there? and, as you show us around, you can get set up for the moon photos and dim the lights when you like."
"okay. i guess to show you around, we have to un- stow everything. we're - we're pretty well stowed for reentry right now. we have all the samples stowed, the suits are all stowed, and i guess, in _-_ order to show you around, we'd have to do some unstowing because under - beneath the couches right now, it's jsmmed full. and i guess we'd like to do that for you, but it's some - somewhat imprac- tical, in that all you can see would be some edges of some white bags, and that's why we have the room in the cabin here. every - everything's pretty well squared away. hut, when we get back, i'm sure you'll have an opportunity to see the many things we have, and there's really a lot of it."
"0 - okay, dave. that's fine. and i guess one last request is when you get over to that window to - and before you take the photos, could you give us a quick picture of the moon with the tv camera?"
sure will.
"15, the word here is to proceed; give your photog- raphy first priority there, and maybe we can see the - the moon out of the other window."
okay. we're working on it.
"15, houston. we hear that your attitude is very good right now; there's no need to trim the maneuver."
"okay, thank you."
"okay, houston. i think you have a picture of her now. there she is."
"15, so far we have a blank screen down here."
"oh, really? i've got a good picture on the monitor."
"hang on for a moment, please."
it's coming through now.
that's a beautiful picture with just an edge of the moon coming out of eclipse.
roger; that's right.
"15, houston. we'd like to ask if you've got full zoom there?"
roger. it's all the way out.
could you please give us alc to peak?
i think we are; just stand by 1. 1t 06 56 43 cdr ...
"hello, endeavour; this is yankee clipper. over."
"hello, yankee clipper. how are you? 11 06 59 59 ncc roger. i've got a naval tradition to pass on to you"
go ahead.
"roger. when ships of the line have completed a mission such as yours and they return to home port, they always have a broom flying from the yardarm. over."
"roger. well, we'll do that."
thank you.
"we wouldn't want to break any traditions, dicky. ll 07 o0 33 ncc dave, i'm watching you; i wouldn't let you."
"that a boy, and i'm glad."
"okay, houston. we're going to switch windows herewith the tv camera, so we can switch windows f_ with the camera cameras."
"roger, dave."
"15, houston. when somebody gets a free hand up there, could we start the charge on battery a? we're afraid that might keep us from going to bed if we don't get it started soon. _""_ tape 175/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"houston, the moon is an orange ball, now - a dull orange ball with a sort of a gray area in the cen- ter on - on one side opposing the side that's slowly coming into illumination at the present time, and you'll possibly get more and more of the lunar surface exposed to sunlight as we go along here. the picture you have is really pretty good for what we see, because there's very little illu- mination on the moon. and only when we get the cockpit lights down reasonably low and get our face up in the window can we see the definition. so it's really not a bad picture."
"roger, 15. thanks for the description, and the picture we're .getting down here is quite good also."
"okay, i'm sure you'll have a much better one here in a few minutes. ll 07 _202 cc apollo 15, houston. over"
"houston, 15. go."
roger. it looks llke you've had enough of the pho - photography for right now. it's beginning to get pretty bright on the tube. i guess we can go ahead and power it down.
·okay.
"that's interesting, houston, because it looks like only about - oh, maybe 1/20th or so, maybe, of the moon is illuminated at this time; just a thin sliver, but very bright."
"roger. copy, dave. _ 11 07 15 49 _ roger."
"apollo 15, houston. request s-band aux to science, please."

"houston, apollo 15."
"roger, apollo 15; go ahead."
"in getting ready for the contam_uation photography, we find that we've got a - a certain number of exposures left in the nikon. namely, we're on exposure number 29 in mag victor, and we think we have 45 total, which would enable us to complete the contamination photography with the nikon, if you desire, rather than with the dac, as you changed."
"15, they plan on using those last 15 frames or so on victor for postmission callbration, so we still intend to press on with the dac, please, dave."
"all right, understand. thank you."
"and, dave, if you give us a start time on that, i'll give you a call at the end, because we want you to cycle some extra film through the dac to give them a little leader there at the end to protect their film or something."
"okay, we'll do that. stand by."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
go ahead_ bob.
"roger. we were seeing the optics tripped around against the hard stops. we'd like to have you bring them back and then zero them in, per the usual procedure. we kind of guess you're getting ready for 52 anyway, aren't you?"
pretty soon.
"and, 15, we have your torquing angles. you go to _-_ torque."
roger; in 30 seconds.
"apollo 15, houston. if one of you guys is free, we've got some updates we could read to you."
"okay, houston; 15. stand by 1,"
"okay, understand you're ready. what - the first thing is an entry pad, so you might whip out your entry checklist."
"okay, houston; 15. go ahead and ... from that."
"roger. would you believe it, we're going to land in the mid-pacific? and after that, it's 000, 153, 000; 294:41:37, 267, plus 26.12, minus 158.10; 06.2; 36097, 6.50; 1084.8, 36179; 294:58:37; 00:29% noun 69s are na; 4.00, 02:13; 00:18, 03:38, 07:44; 04, 140.3, 37.5; 213, down, 09.6, right, 4.7; lift vector, up. comments: (1) use nonexit ems pattern, (2) ret of 90 k, 6 plus 06; ret of mains, 8 plus 32; landing, 13 plus 29; constant g, roll right; moonset time, 294:56:20. over."

"roger, al. good readback. and we'd be interested in knowing the status of the ems check you ran 2 or 3 hours ago, if you have it."
"yes, sir. the ems check was just fine."
"okay, that's good to know. at the end of your contamination experiment here, we'll be going into this mass spec boom test. and, if you guys let me know when you're ready, we've got a procedure to _ read up to you for that - that we'll read up to you at that time. i assume you've been told that we aren't going to a midcourse 6, and right now mid- course 7 is looking like .09 which is - makes it kind of problematical as to whether we burn it or not. weather in the recovery area is currently predicted to be, for your splashdown, 15-knot winds, 4-foot seas, 2000 scattered, l0 miles- in other _ words, looking better and better all the time."
"roger, bob; that sounds great."
"apollo 15, houston. if you'll give us accept, we'll give you a very slight clock update to sync you for entry. and be advised we will not be sending a state vector up-link at this time; your vector is still just as good as the one on the ground."
"roger; understand, and you've got accept."
"15, your computer."
roger. thank you. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription
"15, houston. request you trim back to the original attitude now."
okay.
"and again, if one of you has a couple of minutes, we can tell you a couple of other things."
"okay, in - in other words, you want us to maneuver back to the original attitude, rather than just damp rates, huh?"
roger; yes. we'd like to use the same star back- grounds; so that means going back to the original attitude in the flight plan around 271:20 or so -
okay. _ ll 08 38 16 cc which is what you got called up.
"no, we don't have that called up. all we have is damp rates, but we'll do that. oh, what we have called up here? yes, okay."
"and, 15; houston. if one of you has some time, we'd like to talk about some stowage, please."
"okay, go ahead."
"okay, we've gone over the stowage which you read down this morning, and everything's shipshape, except we have one question on one item and that concerns the stowage of the core stems. the core stems should be stowed in the sleep restraint that has the cmp's pga in it. we understand that it's now stowed in the bag on the side of a-8. i guess our first question is, how many - how long is the core stem at the present time? did you break it down, or is it still three sections long, which we think it is on the ground?"
"no, it's still three sections long, and we could put it in the sleep restraint. it just seemed like a convenient place to stick it in the bag over there to keep it tied down well."
"okay. next question is, how'd you get it in the a-8 bag, which according to our measurements on the ground is only 36 inches long and, therefore, apparently not long enough to hold the three lengths of core stem?"
"well, it's sticking out a little bit, i guess we have to admit, but it's pretty well cinched down."
"okay, stand by."
but it's no problem; we can put it anyplace you like.
"okay, dave, i guess we - i don't think it makes an awful lot of difference, but it'd probably make a lot of other people happy if we ended up putting it inthe sleep restraint. they wouldn't worry about that loose end hanging out there - if it's not too much trouble."
"oh, it's no problem at all; be glad to do that."
thank you.
"you know, we know what number one priority on this spacecraft is."
"we wouldn't - we wouldn't lose that or misplace it or get it rattled around for anything, bob."
no comment.
"and you say everything else is okay, huh?"
roger; everything else is a-okay.
"oh, boy."
"and, 15, reminder or a question, did you guys get the word that they like a pad of about 2 seconds worth of 24 frames per second at the end of those photos to protect these things?"
"roger; we got that, bob. thank you."
"and if you guys'il give me a call when you're ready to do the mass spec boom test, i'll read it up to you."
"all righty, houston; stand by."
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, you going to read up the procedures real time on the mass spec boom?"
roger.
"okay, why don't we go ahead and do that, the_ while we're finishing up the contamination photos?"
"okay, standby. okay_ 15, the first step is mass spec boom to retract, talkback barber pole for 4 minutes or until gray. if talkback fully gray within 4 minutes, deploy boom and return to flight plan. over."
"roger. understand you want retract on the mass spec boom for 4 minutes, and, if it goes gray be- f-_ fore then, go back to deploy and return to the flight plan."
that's affirmative. and give - give us a call when you get done.
roger.
"come in, houston; 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, there's 4 minutes of retract, and it's still barber pole."
"okay, if the talkback is not fully gray in 4 minutes, let's go to mass spec boom, off, center, for i min- ute. that's just to let the motor cool down."
"okay, it's off now."
okay.
and what at the end of the i minute?
"okay, at the end of the i minute, we will deploy it for 20 seconds and then off, center, and then we will retract for 40 seconds or until the talk- back is 1/2 barber pole or fully gray and then off. over."
"okay, got you."
"okay, going to extend."
okay.
and do you want to pause it off between extend and retract? ih 08 53 53 cc stand by. not necessary to pause between deploy and retract on this.
"okay, it's in retract now."
"copy. 11 08 5h 43 cmp okay, houston, that's the 40 seconds of retp_ct, and it's at half barber pole, and i turned it off."
"okay. in that case, we'd like you to repeat the 20-second deploy, 40-second retract sequence twice more and, if gray talkback is still not obtained, we'll turn it off and wait until 275 hours, at which point we'll give you a call and we'll replay - we'll repeat that. over."
"okay, fine. we'll cycle that whole thing twice more."
"roger. 1! 08 57 16 cc 15, houston. we'd like to proceed with the fuel cell purges now to get those out of the way before the p23s. i1 08 57 25 cmp roger, houston."
"houston, mass spec boom has been cycled three times. ail i can get out of it is a half barber pole, and i've got it turned off right now."
"roger; copy, al. we'll call you at 275 hours to repeat that. the reason for that is that pres- ently we're sort of sitting in a cold-soak attitude. we're going to repeat it at 275 hours when we're sort of in a hot-soak attitude. 11 08 5u 43 cmp okay. r',"

"okay, i'll show you this one."
thanks.
"15, houston. looks like a good set of p23s again, al. and your g_mma, right now, on your vector, is 6.5."
"it sounds like, after a whilejwe might get along without you, huh, bob?"
no comment.
"as a matter of fact, if you guys keep working on your ground vectors, they might even converge to the onboard vectors pretty soon."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston; 15."
"roger; 274:05, we'd like to delete the mass spec line, where you turn on multiplier, low, et cetera. we'll delete that."

thank you.
"and, houston; 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"roger; want us to - delete the logic power, two, if we're going to do the mass spec at 275?"
"15, that's affirmative."
okay.

"okay. the attitude that we maneuver to at 274:46 there, for the second set of x-rays should be changed - that verb 49 maneuver, should be changed to 196, 346, 012. over."
"roger. understand the verb 49 maneuver to x-ray pointing attitude should be changed to 196, 346, 012."
"roger. and, before we start that verb 49 maneuver at 274:45 or thereabouts, we'd like to cover the ex - we'd like to close the experiment covers, alpha/x-ray, to close. that's the one on panel 278. and then after we get to attitude at about 275:00, we'll go ahead and open those covers again, the alpha/x-rays."
"roger. understand, you want the alpha/x-ray covers closed before the maneuver and opened after the maneuver."
roger. these - the new position i sent you up on that - those two steps there in the procedure are to keep from getting sunlight right in on some of the stuff to protect it. and - - 11 t0 39 19 cdr okay.
"- - and, also at this time, you may terminate the battery a charge."
"okay, terminating battery a charge."
"houston, 15."

"roger. guidance says thank you to al. and if - a couple other things here, if one of you guys has a chance, we'd like a mag - magazine status read- out tonight, and we're seeing some noise on dave's biosensors. he might want to check them or push them down a little bit or something."
"okay, i'll do that. and you want a magazine status read-out. what do - what do you mean by that exactly?"
"roger. that means how many picture's been taken in some of the magazines there. i think al's been doing it. he probably knows what's going on, if he can tell you."
"okay. i - i guess we don't have a good answer for you on that, bob. they're all stowed away. and _-_ they've all been recorded as we've gone along. is there any particular need for them before tomorrow sometime?"
"negative, dave. that's a good answer, it turns out."
okay. i think you'll find them all neatly tucked away and recorded when - when you get them on the ship.
"if you're wondering how many pictures we took, at last count night before last, it was something like 1840 some."
"understand, 1847."
or somewhere around the ball park. _-_ 11 12 45 56 cc is that plus or minus one?
"i think that was lm though, maybe yes. then you have to add to that the command module."
"you mean like a mile of pan camera film, huh?"
something like that. it looks like it ought to hold a mile by the size of the thing.
"houston, 15."
"go ahead, 15."
"well, i had - had the log out here, and i took a look at it, and as last count last night, we were 2631 on hasselblad pictures, total."
copy.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston; 15."
"roger, dave. the interest in the mags was with reference to uv - the mags for the uv photography tomorrow. so the interest was in the number of frames remaining on magazine mike and magazine papa, try - trying to determine which of those would be usable for tomorrow's uv photography."
"okay. i think we've got that log in the flight plan. stand by until a1 finishes his p23s, and we'll take a look."
roger; understand. no big rush.
think we'll use a mag that has some film in it.
"say again, dave."
"i said, at - at any rate, we'll use a mag that has some film in it tomorrow."
that's a good idea.
"apollo 15, houston. requesting gamma ray gainstep, shield off, now, please."
"roger. shield off, now."
"that was a good mark, al."
"yes, and it didn't update the state vector very much."
"apollo 15, houston."
go ahead.
"roger. congratulations, al. you've just been voted to receive a second vasco da gama award for that. we were afraid you were going to do them all the way through the rest period."
"well, they're fun enough. i wouldn't mind."
so were we.
(laughter) okay; and - -
it wouldn't have taken nearly so long if you hadn't wanted five m_ks per each star.
"roger, al. i'll tell you about that some time. and, 15, we're configured for the e-mod dump, if you fellows want to give it to us."
"okay, it's coming. does our bio data look any better?"
"roger. yes, it does."
okay.
"and, as you get ready for the ptc, we'd like to do the ptc at 0.42 there again tonight as last night, although it's changing the noun 79 value there at 277:14."
"roger, bob. i guess we use that as standard pro- cedure now, the 4200. ll 13 17 21 qc roger. you don't have to do it tomorrow night f-_ that way, though."
okay. use a different number tomorrow night?
"and, apollo 15, be advised that tomorrow when you're taking your p23 marks, five marks on the cal and then three marks on the stars for the p23 itself will be sufficient."
"okay, understand. five marks on the cal and three on each star."
roger. roger.
"hey, houston, 15. we've got the presleep checklist ready, too."
roger. we're standing by.
"okay. the crew's all ready for bed, no medication, and the onboard read-out: battery cj37; pyro bat a, 37.1; b, 37.1; rcs a, 55; b, 50; c is 48; d, 52. and i guess everything else is done. you've got your e-memory dump, and we're ready to power down as soon as we get the ptc going. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"roger, dave. as far as we're concerned, we're all finished also. we will not be up-linking a state vector to you. we might have to do that some time just for practice, but so far we haven't needed to up-link one to you. you guys are doing pretty super on those p23s."
compensating errors.
"i can't believe that was a unanimous vote, dave."
"no, it was only two to one."
"apollo 15, houston. you're go to start to spinup for ptc."
"okay, bobby. thank you."
"and, apollo 15, we'd like you to check that the potable tank inlet valve is open, please."
"roger; understand. potable tank inlet valve, open."
"houston, 15."
"all right, go ahead, 15."
"okay. listen, potable tank inlet valve is open and has been the whole flight. what prompted the question?"
stand by.
"we're just curious. _ ll 13 30 56 cc 15, we saw a drop in the potable at the same time that the waste tank was staying stable, and we were - just concerned that it might have gotten out of configuration. we certainly expected it to be open; we just wanted to check it before you went to sleep, so we didn't have to wake you up."
"okay. understand. yes - we're reading potable _, at 90 percent."
"roger. we're reading 94. 11 13 43 _2 cc apollo 15, houston. no need to acknowledge, but we'd like to put the dsky to sleep before you guys go to sleep. tapes 180-183/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription rest period - no communications apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"

"joe, sounds like you're really in harmony this morning."
that's one.
"okay, houston; endeavour. we got a postsleep checklist for you."
"okay, dave. go ahead."
"okay. about 8 hours apiece on the sleep, and ready for your consumables."

okay. give us a couple of minutes on those. thank you. apollo 15 air-t0-ground voice transcription
"houston, endeavour."
go ahead.
"well, we just got our first view of the earth this morning, and, can you believe it's getting larger and it's getting smaller? we see just a very, very thin sliver of a very large round ball."
"roger, dave. i believe that."
"and, go ahead on the updates, joe."
"roger, dave. these are the flight plan updates for today. and - would you believe - i don't have any dap load changes to give you, which is fortu- nate. the first addition is at 288 plus 18. and it reads ""x-ray to off, alpha particle to off."""
"okay, 288:18, x-hay, off, and alpha, off. go."
"roger. and all the rest are just reminders, really. the first one at - on - at 290, on the uv photos page, you've already changed the two frames line to read one frame at 20 seconds and the second frame at 2 seconds. a reminder to use mag papa instead of mag metro. and, finally, we'd like to remind you to enable all jets before beginning the maneuvers today. and we're - we're thinking now we'll likely do amidcourse 7 correction of about - probably around 5 feet per second. over."
"okay. i got the uv on the change, and the ...; enable all jets prior to maneuvers; and you're looking at midcourse 7 of 5. that's very interesting."
"it's also not certain, but we'll keep you posted on that. and that's all the official updates i have for you. i have a news s,_mmary, if you'd like to listen."
okay. everybody's in ...; go ahead.
"roger. and this will be a short one. the rest of it you can read for yourselves today in the papers. congress has started a month-long summer __ recess, setting the pattern for a government-wide exodus, likely to make washington a virtual ghost town for the rest of august. the senate finally quit at 7:30 friday night, more than 6 hours after the house had adjourned at about 1 in the afternoon. and after passing an $18 billion higher education bill and three key appropriations measures. besides the labor-hew appropriations, the senate approved, friday, a $1 billion measure to provide public ser- vice jobs mainly for vietnam veterans and a con- tinuing resolution to fund agencies still without regular appropriations until the 15th of october. in chile, four sic government ministers present_ their resignations to president salvador allende on friday, causing the first cabinet crisis since the president took office last november. i have a long list of baseball scores which i think i'll skip over here. in exhibition football, the buffalo bills downed the new orleans saints, 14 to 10, and the cowboys won over the l.a. rams, 45 to 21. in the american golf classic at the firestone country club in akron, ohio, jerry heard is still leading with 7 under par, 133, at the halfway mark. and bob lunn is next with a 4 under par, 136. the united states basketball team was eliminated yes- terday in the pan-american games in colombia, and the u.s. baseball team was upset by the dominic_l republic, 5 to 4. in tennis, stan smith is the last seeded player still in competition at the western championships in cincinnati. and today in chestnut hills, massachusetts, marty riessen meets australian ken rosewall, and south african cliff drysdale meets john newcombe in the semi- finals of the u.s. professional tennis tournament. _d that's all i have from here. over."
"okay. thank you, joe. that's interesting."
"hey, houston, 15. by the way, where did the 5 feet per second come from? should we get our trusty navigator up there to navigate some more for you?"
"dave, it probably came for - from the uncoupled - thrusting we were doing yesterday. other than that, i'm not really sure. it's - it's by no means certain. anyway we're just i guess - we'll be watch- ing it today and get back with you, with the final bit of information on it."
"okay. very good. just thought maybe we'd get our navigator to navigate again, and it would probably go away, as most of them have done so far."
"endeavour, the saturday morning weather report for the landing area reads, ""high scattered, 2000 scat- tered, 15-knot winds out of the east-northeast, 10 miles vis, and waves going to 4 feet."" it should be well above your personal minimum."
looks very good. we appreciate that.
sounds like the recovery troops have things in hand as usual.
"yes, indeed."
"endeavour, this is houston. requesting gamma ray, gainstep, switch to center, please."
"roger. gamma ray, gainstep, to center."

"go ahead, bob."
roger. correction of the flight plan. we'd like to have all crewmembers on the biomed harness for entry. i suspect that means that dave won't be doffing his about now.
"okay, i guess we could give you two. the - our trusty cmp has his off and stowed for entry."
roger. copy.
"okay, 15. looks like the surgeons can live with that without too much trouble. 12 00 34 18 _ roger."

"go ahead, houston."
"okay. if you guys have a moment or two, we have some flight plan updates concerning entry - entry cue cards and entry checklist. over."
stand by.
"well, bob, it'll be about a half an hour before we're ready to talk about those changes."
"okay, jim. give me a call when you!re ready."
okay.
"houston, 15, i have some valve temps for you."
"roger, 15. we're ready to copy."
"okay, 5-c is 4.5; 5_d is 4.4; 6_a, 4.4; 4.4; 4.6; and 4.5."

okay. we copy.
"15, houston. we have your torquing angles."
roger; thank you.
"apollo 15. request omni chariie, please."
roger. omni charlie.
houston: apollo 15. we're ready for your entry updates now if you like.
"roger, 15. understand you're ready for the update. tell a1 that was another super set of arcs, certainly."
"yes, that one came out pretty fair, didn't it?"
"okay, 15. the first change is in the entry check- list, second page; and, on page 1-2, we wish to delete step 21, which is the ""dsky condition light test."""
okay. step 21 deleted.
you may remember that one from the sim; that's the one with the - gives us the p35 and turns the pipas off momentarily.
"yes, i guess we don't want to do that today .... - -"
"that's - that's a roger. okay, the next one, dave, is on page 6, when we're checking the circuit breaker configuration on panel 8; and we're going to add ""sps pilot valve a main a and b main b, open. verify."" over."
"okay. sps pilot valves main a and b both open, and - configuration of the circuit breakers on panel 8. go ahead."
"okay. then if we go down to the entry cue card, down to the p67 section."
okay. go.
"okay. down there near the middle where it says ""steering commands downrange error minus 6 to 0,"" that should be changed to ""downrange error minus 24 to 0."" over."
roger. just like it is in the checklist. right? and i think we noticed that last night looking it over.
"okay. and next, on the second line under the noun 68, there's a comment that says ""negative (if plus: ems)."" and there's a certain amount of unhappiness with that statement down here. they say that you can have a positive h-dot in p67 nominally and, therefore, the statement on the cue card that this is a fail indication is not a good idea. i understand vance discussed this with a1 beforehand."
"okay. we'll scratch that. i don't think we'll get to a p66 - 67 turnover anyway, but we'll scratch that one out. thank you, bob."
"roger. we hope not. and we have a question here, dave, that we need an answer for, apparently con- cerning stowage. people are concerned about the hooks on the back of the r-12, the flight data file container, which is now stowed in one of the pga bags. and they are concerned that those hooks be placed in such a way that they will not be in any danger of piercing the aft bulkhead - the pres- sure bulkhead. so i guess you can tell how they're placed or what's underneath them to prevent such occurrences."
"okay. we'll make sure of that. and i guess the problem with r-12 was that, once we got all the lm data onboard, we didn't have any place to put it, or else we didn't have any place to put the lm data. and if you have any better suggestions on where to put them, we'll be glad to do it."
"i don't think we have any right now, dave. i guess the quickest thing would have been to just put it in the pga bag with the hooks pointing up."
okay. we'll do that.
"and one reminder, dave. you guys undoubtedly know it. just a reminder that you will not have any back lighting for the scroll and no lighting on the roll bug today."
okay. no back lighting for the scroll and no lighting on the roll bug. thank you.
"have anything else, bob?"
"no, dave. that's all i have for the moment."
okay. that's pretty easy.
"houston, we're standing by for a vhf cbmm check."
"stand by, jim. we'll see if they're ready."
"15, houston. we'll have to stand by for another few hours to get you close enough to do that vhf comm check. 12 01 38 54 u_p all right. roger. we understand."
"apollo 15, houston. 12 01 39 57 _ houston, 15. go."
"roger. could we have a reading of the - an onboard reading of the potable tank quantity, please?"
eighty-two percent.
"copy; 82 percent. 12 0i 42 07 cc apollo 15, houston. over."
"houston, 15. go. tape186/5"
"roger. could you guys check the potable tank inlet valve again for us, and find out whether it is in the closed or open position? once again, what we're seeing is the waste tank increase and the potable tank has been staying constant all morning."
"okay; last night when you called, i even went down and recycled that valve and made sure it was in the detent in the open position, which it was."
"okay. in that case, could you go down and cycle it from closed to open again for us, please?"
roger. we're doing that right now.
"okay, it was still open, and a1 cycled it from open to closed and back to open."
"okay. thank you. it's no big deal, dave, nothing to worry about."
might as well get everything all tr_mmed up.
"that's what we're trying to do. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription j'_ 12 02 00 24 cc apollo 15, houston. requesting omni delta."

"15, houston. if you'll give us high gain and pitch of plus 7, yaw of 250, then we'll be able to keep high gain for the next 2 or 3 hours, and i won't have to keep calling you for omnis. over."
okay; understand plus 7 and 250 on the high gain.
roger.
"15, houston. we're noticing some drift in roll. if you're not through with the uv photos, we'd like you to retrim back to attitude, please."
"okay, and we are finished with the uv photos."
okay; takes care of that one.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"go ahead, bob."
"okay; if you guys got a minute, we can do a few things here. number l, if you give us accept, we'll send you some state vector and target loads; and, number 2, we have a couple comments to read to you."
"okay; you have accept, and stand by."
"roger; you're getting the up-link, and we're standing by."
"15, the computer's yours. you have state target and refsmmat. _-- 12 02 32 01 cdr roger. thank you."
"and, houston, we're all on. you can go with your comments."
"okay; first one, news concerning the water business. -- we've been having you check that valve. it looks to us now as though there's a blockage into the potable tank. you got obviously - a - far more water than you need to survive the rest of the mission, but it does mean that the waste tank will be filling up, and there is a possibility that it will start to vent about an hour or 2 before ei. it's been discussed down here and decided that the best way to do this is - far as not perturbing the vector too much - is to let it relieve overboard and not to do a dump ahead of time or turn the water boiler on ahead of time. in line with this, we might just verify that the pressure relief valves down on panel 352 - the water control panel, is in the relief position. it certainly should be there; it's just a - a little verification to make sure we're - we're not going wrong there. second, i - -"
okay. that's verified.
"okay; thank you. second item is, we suggest that it might be reasonable to put some tape over the sps light on the ems to keep you from confusing with the .05g light, in case you have a problem there, al. that's your option, obviously. it just a suggestion."
"oh, i don't think he'll have any confusion with that."
okay.
... make sure we watch it.
"and the third question is, from your comments when we were talking about r-12, some people believe you may be asking us a question that you have a problem with stowage of some of the extra lm data file, or have you found a place for that already?"
"oh, no; that's all tucked away in r-3 very - very neatly. we have no - no problem at all with the stowage. we just wanted to locate r-12 in a nice soft spot and secure it down, which it is."
"okay. we - we were - crank up building 45 to find you a location if you needed it. _ 12 02 34 20 cc and, 15; houston. we've got an entry pad and a midcourse 7 pad if you're ready to copy."

"okay. 0b 17 38 24 cdr i've got 4.9. 'j conftdenj,4"
4.85 and holding.
okay.
okay. cabin's at 3.5.
cabin suit circuit.
is at 4.5.
"0k_j. 04 17 38 38 i24p pga is 4 8 and coming on down. houston, we are ready to start our watches."
give us a mark.
"okay; 3, 2, 1 -"
mark it. we're off and running. time zero.
"okay. over here - let's see, forward do$_ valve, open now."
"okay. i'm going to dump. and there's the tone. 0h 17 39 31 lmp tone on; water flag, a."
"water flag, a."
"five pounds pressure. *** 0.6 pounds in the cabin, *** half a pound in the cabin. you mighl be able to get the door open partly."
yes.
better let her drop a little more. it's a pretty heavy pull there.
you got a lot of surface area on that hatch.
"yes. okay, there's a quarter of a pound. still tight, huh? let her drop. rest a minute. let her drop."
okay. it should be almost zero now.
we're showing a 10th of a pound right now.
there it comes. okay. final prep. plss feed - plss feedwater.
"would you hold it for me, please? 04 17 41 04 lmp' yes, i got it."
thank you. 04 17 41 07 _lv okay -
i can get it now. 04 17 41 10 l_ straight - straighten up.
... there we go.
"okay. pls$ feedwater, open."
okay. we're waiting for the water flag.
*** don't have the preamps or the ecs caution lights.
"no, they're on."
are they? 04 17 43 45 _p yes.
"oh, i see. you've got them on dim. okay. 04 17 43 52 _p okay .... be getting a water flag clear here in a minute."
"okay, my pga is getting down to about usable pressure of 4.3 now. what's yours now?"
okay. reading 4.2.
"we ought to be able to work in a minute. okay. the present warning status is good. we have a water sep light, preamps, ecs. confidenti,, j"
"ed, this is houston. we're showing your feed- water pressure going up. you ought to be in business shortly."
roger. water pressure - water flag just cleared. that's great.
"you know, it's smazing."
"how's yours, al? your water flag about to clear?"
"don't know, it's still up there. no. there, it's gone."
al's pressure is rising now; it ought to clear momentarily.
"okay, al's water flag is clear."
okay. now we know what it all means.
beautiful.
"oh, hum. okay. 04 17 45 32 _ okay. lighting, an_nciator to dim. okay."
dim. stop the det.
"ail right, det is stopped."
okay.
fcrward hatch the rest of the way open.
a/1 righty.
*** reg monitor. okay. forward hatch is open. lower your visor.
let me get a - get a -
yes. let me - 04 17 46 07 _p that's fine. can you get - reach everything now? okay. stay right there. itm going to help you. $onfidenttaijlw
"we're on the way now. about ready? okay, very good."
i'll get your antenna as you go out.
all righty. starting out the door.
"yon're going to have to get your plss down a little; roll toward me. 04 17 46 55 cde okay, coming over."
"there you go. now you're clear. your head down as soon as you can. back right on out. that's great. wait a minute, let me get your antenna; hold it."
okay.
you'll have to get mine when i come out. okay. you're clear. go on out.
"okay, clear of the hatch. give me a jettison bag. 04 17 47 32 i_p roger. let me get over here on the other side, so i can get to it. 04 17 47 46 lbip oops."
"i'm hung up on something, al."
probably that - 04 17 48 19 lm_ it's the door handle. i got it loose now.
"okay, very good. 04 17 48 33 lmi okay, jettison bag coming at you."
"okay. okay, i've got it now. standing by for the lec. 04 17 48 48 _4p okay. it, confidentia,,ii"
"okay, houston. while he's working on the lec, let me comment that it certainly is a stark place here at fra mauro. i think it's made all the more stark by the fact that the sky is completely black."
roger.
"okay, i have the conveyor now. have the bag. and it's deployed. and standing by to deploy the mesa. and the mesa has released -mesa has released properly, houston."
starting down the ladder.
"roger, al."
"oke_, al; beautiful. we can see you coming down the ladder right now. it looks like you're about on the bottom step. on the surface."
"okay, you're right. a1 is on the surface. and it's been a long way, but we're here. and i can see the reason we have a tilt is because we landed on the slope. the landing gear struts appear to be about evenly depressed."
"i'm moving around, getting familiar - -"
"roger, al."
"- - getting familiar with the surface. the surface on which the forward footpad landed is extremely soft. as a matter of fact, it's in a small depres- sion. the - the soil is so soft that it comes up all the way to the top of the footpad; it even folded over the sides to some degree. the same is true of the plus-y strut."
"okay, we'll move on over. take a look at fra ma_ro. i - take a look at cone crater, i should say, which is right where it should be, and is a very impressive sight. you can see the boulders near the rim as - -"
"antares, this is houston. you are go for two-man _a. over. onfidentt"
"roger, hou - houston. thank you."
"and, continuing, we can see the boulders that are on the rim. it looks as though we have a good traverse route up to the top of cone. i can see cone ridge going along to the north. that's very apparent."
i'm moving over to adjust the mesa.
"roger, al."
"and, houston, i'm finishing up my circuit breaker check. will be ready to go out shortly."
"roger, ed."
"okay, the mesa is adjusted. going over to remove the met blanket."
"okay, al. i'm starting out."
okay.
"okay, ed. we can see you coming down the ladder, now."
and it's very great to be coming down.
roger. bottom step.
the last one is a long one. 04 17 56 17 _p ascent check. very easy to do. a little push and just spring right up.
we got there with those lightweight units.
"yes. sure glad they did, too. that's great. 0b 17 56 45 cc al, this is houston. have you released the met, yet? over. 04 17 56 51 _p he's releasing it now."
"okay, houston. the met is finally clear of the _sa. %confidentiai"
"al, i'm going to come over. how about getting my antenna out before i lose comm here in a minute_"
okay.
if i go around the corner or something.
okay. just drop this baby over here.
okay.
"it's bright up-sun, isn't it?"
"okay. if you'll stop here a minute, i'll get your antenna out. stand by 1. okay, you're now deployed. okay."
thank you.
"okay, houston_ the mesa has been stowed on the plus-y footpad."
roger. out.
i'm going back to adjust the mesa.
"mobility is - very great under this crushing one-sixth-g load, houston."
roger.
"and looking at cone crater, where a1 was looking a short time ago, it doesn't appear there is going to be any trouble getting the met up cone crater."
the backup crew copies.
i knew they would.
we knew the troops on the ground would be glad to hear that.
the mesa blanket is coming off here. age3-30 ccinfidentj/!till
here comes the lens cap.
you'll lose television for a moment.
roger. mesa blanket.
okay. that's beautiful.
"okay, senor."
"let me give you a hand, and we'll get it dcne."
okay. 04 18 00 24 lm' put this back on?
"ed, *** 04 18 00 31 lm_ great. 0h 18 o0 36 cdr okay, the lens cap is going on now_ houston, while we set up the tripod - move the tv to another location."
"antares, this is houston. request emu statu_ check here. 04 18 00 52 i_ okay, houston. lmp is 3.75 psi; reading - _5 85 percent; all flags go. on - -"
min cooling? oh 18 01 10 lmp min cooling.
"okay, cdr here is 81 percent."
"and, a1 - - oh 18 01 17 cdr cdr is 81 percent; 3.75, no flags, min cooling."
roger. out. you're looking good down here.
"and, houston, while al's getting that television, i'll go ahead and get my contingency sample; get it out of the way. iikdnfide"
"roger, ed."
"houston, the contingency sample is being taken about 25 feet to the - in the 01:00 position of the lm, adjacent to a - about a 5-foot crater. i'll identify it for you later. ok 18 03 08 cc roger, out."
"do you want to watch the cable as we go out, ed?"
okay.
"al, this is houston. would you verify the lens is still capped? over."
"that's affirmative. 04 18 04 38 lmi keep going. oh 18 04 40 cdr okay. it's about 50 feet, i'd say. 0_ 18 ok 4_ l_p why don't we get al2 the cable out while we're at it?"
"okay. go ahead and pull it out, and i'll -"
okay. let me get this contingency sample folded up.
"okay, houston, the lens cap is off. we're aiming for the general area of mesa. 04 18 05 h0 _ a_k,can you pull this - the rest of this cable out away from the mesa here?"
and we got about ... foot zoom. how does that look?
okay. i think you can zoom in a little more. let's try 40 here.
"okay. and, on the f-stop, al, we'd like to stop it down one additional stop. that's toward the higher numbers."
"okay. it's going from 22 to 44, and i'll zoom it in to 40. stand by. confident.!,"
"okay. hold the zoom there, and the position looks good, also."
"okay, how about the f-stop?"
"is the f-stop satisfactory, houston?"
"al, this is houston. see if you can stop it down a little more. run it up - run the diaphragm ring up against the stop there. it's still a little bright."
okay. it's right up against the stop.
"it's up against the stop, houston."
"roger. stand by. al, this is rouston. request you goto peak control."
okay. going to peak. satisfactory?
"okay, al. now, we'd like to open it up to f/22."
"okay, this is the - the adjustment to f/22. there you go."
"al, this is houston. would you confirm that you're at f/22 now?"
"okay, i'm confirming that i'm in peak and that i'm at f/22."
"and, while we're waiting for the television adjust- ments, the 02:30 position, approximately 50 feet where the camera is, is slightly uphill. we see that the lm did, in fact, land on the - sort of a - a downslope. it appears to be in - almost a basin."
"al, this is houston."
go ahead.
"roger, al; this is houston. we'd like _o go back to average and f/44; stop it do_ all the way, and then leave it there. it confident4 iii"
"okay, this is the last adjustment. going to f/44. and going - -"
roger. and back the zoom out to about 35.
- - and going to average. and back the zoom out to 35. how does that look?
beautiful.
"okay, pressing on. s-band antenna - -"
roger; press.
"again continuing - continuing; the soil is very fine here - very fine grain; and, as we mentioned before, there is - there are very few samples that - of any size at all. mostly hand-sample size, and stacks of generally under 2 inches or less."
"roger. houston, as you can see, the src table is deployed. bb is emptied, and i'm putting the lioh canisters in it now."
"roger, ed. and you did leave the contingency sample on the ladder?"
that's affirmative. that's where it is.
"houston, it looks as though we've landed in a fairly rough place."
yes; indeed it does. evidenced by the fact that you dug your front landing gear into a hole.
"and, houston, i have the swc out and setting out to deploy it."
"roger, ed."
"am i still in your field of view, houston?"
affirmative.
okay. pag -e34 c nfident 5 _._j!l!_ day
"okay, a1 is bringing the s-band antenna around. positioning."
"roger, al; we're watching you."
"and, houston, the swc's in place."
"roger, ed. that's 114 plus 53 plus 48 get. swc."
"and, houston, the lr cubed is coming off."
"roger, ed."
"al, this is houston. if you would, give us the commentary on how the legs go into the surface."
"okay, the legs are in the surfa;_e approxima_e!y 1 inch, i would say. appear to be fairly equal all the way around - perhaps the leg to the left is in an inch and a half."
roger. we were driving more at force penetration. and did you meet any rocks or anything like thav?
i didn't attempt to run any kind of an experiment - forcing the legs down. i just - just - -
"roger, i copy. 04 18 17 17 lm_ and here comes the s-band antenna cable. al, you're too far away. 0b 18 17 2k cc looks more like a kangaroo. 04 18 17 25 _4p it should have more cable than that. it's hung u_."
"okay. how are we in respect to the cable? 04 18 17 45 l_ i'm afraid you're too far away. 0b 18 17 _9 cdr well, i wanted to get maximum length. i'm moving on in. 0b 18 17 53 l_ that's better. let's see. yes, i want to do that, too. %confident,"
"this is all she - i've got, al."
"okay, we'll bring it in."
right over here. right about in here anywhere will probably do it.
we'll have to put it right here to get it level.
okay.
_ okay. can you reach that?
"oh, yes."
"okay. if you want to stand clear, we'll deploy the antenna. 04 18 18 36 l_ let her rip."
"okay, here we go."
it's hung up at the top.
...
yes. if you'll tilt it over toward me without drcpping it_ i'll get it unhung for you.
ail. righty. ready for it?
ali right. lower it on down.
okay.
"keep coming. okay, set her up."
okay. all kinds of freebies in today's simulators.
roger. we got the boys in the backroom working overtime.
sure have.
okay. age3-36 %confidenti/ ii day5
sure you got it_
"appears to be. oh 18 20 oh _,_ okay."
"okay. there is earth, way up there."
how does that look ... - -
"looks like it's getting close. let me get on the _lass. 04 18 20 h3 cdr take that - turn it to the left a little more. wait a minute, because that changes the whole deal. 04 18 20 58 l_ ... step over here."
that's about it for azimuth.
okay. i don't see it_ al.
"well, just put it back down again. okay."
"okay. i think my plss - my ops is hitting it. oh 18 21 17 cdr ail rig_, just a second. let me back it offs minute and move this a little bit."
"okay, that's about it for azimuth, i'll come down a little bit. oh 18 21 32 l_ okay."
let me just check through which way we want to go. 04 18 21 4h cdr ...
okay.
"okay, coming down a little bit,"
you're do_m.
"hold it. son fidenti., iim"
"back up just a bit. right there. okay, i have the earth centered."
okay.
"okay, houston. boresighted the - the earth, dark side and all."
this is houston. roger.
"okay. the s-band anterma has been erected and alined, and the cable has been attached - -"
and i'll go back in to switch. okay.
roger_ ed. and we'd like to get an emu status report as you go by.
okay. the cdr's reading 3.75. reading 76 on the 02 . i have no flags; i'm still in minimum flow; and i'm comfortable.
"okay, and this is ed. i'm reading 3.75, about 75 percent 02, no flags, minimum cooling, and i'm very comfortable, too."
roger. out.
ands i guess - contingency sample into the etb.
okay.
bruce. is any appreciable dust flying off of these boots? i'd like not to take all that dirt in there.
i didn't notice any on the tv.
okay.
"and, houston; i'm back in the lm without a great deal of problem."
"roger, ed."
"i'm getting ready to switch to lunar stay. give me a call, and, if i don't hear you in about 30 seconds, we will go back. okay?"
"ed, this is houston. you're go to switch to lunar stay. go ahead. 04 18 25 17 limp and, houston; this is ed. how do you read?"
"loud and clear, ed."
"okay, you're on the erectable antenna."
roger. and how are you reading us?
loud and clear.
"beautiful. 04 18 25 39 _p okay, alan; i'm ready for the etb, most anytime."
okay. take it on up. it's ready for you.
and did the contingency sample get in there?
that's affirmative.
"it'd never do for us to leave that one behind, bruce."
"okay. well, bruce is loading up the etb."
who?
"oh, excuse me. while ed is loading up the etb - -"
don't i wish it - -
"while ed is loading up the etb, i'll describe the general landing site. we are, in fact, in a - in a low area. there seems to be a general swale or a wide valley between the triplet craters and the doublet craters. and we are on - we are on the downhill side at this particular point. it levels off at a lower elevation to the left of the lm, approximately 15 feet lower there, and then it % confidentj starts back up to the rim of doublet. it's a very uneven landing area here. and, of course, like all of the sections of the moon, it's pock- marked by a - enormous amount of craters. the surface here, as we pointed out, is mostly fines, and i hate to discuss any kind of lineations here in the immediate vicinity of the lm, because i can see very definite indications of the radial dust pattern caused by the descent engine. and *** any other lineal pattern, as such, right here in the area. 0_ 18 28 09 cdr there are perhaps half a dozen very large rocks at the i o'clock position from the lm. but per- haps they're ejected from cone, although they don'5 seem to have any particular ray pattern. they probably are ejected from - from doublet, since they appear to be closer to doublet than they do triplet. they are a lighter gray in material - excuse me - the material is lighter gray in color, and i'm certain that we'll get some of those samples on the way back from our als_ deployment. it's very difficult to assess any kind of stratigraphy in cone right now, look- ing back at it, because we're looking into the sun at a low sun angle, and it's just not the right direction to view that crater when looking for stratigraphy. but there certainly are boul- ders on it. from here, it looks as though they're at least 20 feet in diameter perhaps, at least the ones _e can see here in the western slope. they appear to be grouped fairly close to the rim of _he crater and not too many large boulders on down the sides of the slopes, the outside rim. okay, it looks as though the lm was traveling slowly forward and slowly to the right. as you'll see from the photographs, that's the direction of the landing gear probes, as they're bent. the footpad, plus-y, for example, has a drag pattern of approximately 1 foot."
"okay, ed_ how're you doing up there?"
"okay, al. i've got it loaded. i'm about ready to start down with it now."
okay. age3- 0 c( nfident - ulii 5
just another minute. i have - the isa came loose from its straps and is being a great major headache.
"ed, before you start transferring, you want to verify contents in the etb?"
"okay, let me give you a call on them, bruce. i put in one black-and-white camera, a television camera, two hasselblads, one tds, two 16-millimeter - millimeter mags, and two maps. oh 18 31 36 cc okay. did you get the 16-millimeter camera wivh mag attached? 04 18 31 45 l_ no. thank you. guess we kind of need that _neo"
"yes, that's the one that's supposed to photograph you coming down the ladder."
"uh-oh; all of the contingency -the disposal con- tainers just fell out on the floor. just a minute. get the camera. ob 18 32 32 cdr okay, houston. with respect to _he erosion pattern, directly under the engine bell, there is *** 3 feet to the southeast of the ....location of the bell. that's probably where the thrust was when the engine was cut off. and the i_lslowly drifted to the northwest from there."
"as perhaps you can see from your camera, houston, the view off to the south is an undu2ating hill. and i would estimate that hill back there to the south is, oh, perhaps log feet higher than we are. 04 18 33 53 _ okay, al. i am ready to bring this down."
okay. 04 18 34 o1 l_ wait a minute. got it.
okay.
okay. let her come gently. cipnfide_nii
ail righty.
okay.
"okay, just a second here, we'll get a little more tension. coming over the sill; put a little more tension, please. there you are. okay, coming over the steps now. okay. there are the steps, and i'll take it down slowly."
do you have it in hand?
"negative. just hold it right there for a minute. okay, ease it down a couple of feet. okay, i have it now. thank you."
and it's all yours.
very good. i've got it.
all right. coming out again.
"if you want to wait a minute, iill take a picture of you. 04 18 35 21 _ okay."
okay. we'll give a1 a few seconds to get the camera - -
"okay, about ready? oh 18 36 34 cdr no. stand by 1."
"okay, lens cover is coming off."
"0k_y, come on down."
okay. here i come.
"okay. give me a mark, al, when you start using film."
i just started using film now.
are you on 24? age3- 2 cignfide

"roger, 12."
okay. let me close the hatch.
but not too far.
tell me when i hit the bottom step.
you're at the bottom step. 04 18 38 44 _p i'm on it?
"yes. 04 18 38 46 lm_ oh, okay. i want to miss the lr cubed. okay? and i'm down."
"okay. camera's stopped, houston."
roger.
"okay, up one flag."
"okay, we're right on the time line. right to the minute."
"okay, i'll take the camera, while you get the flag set up. okay. i'll go off to the left over there by the swc. it will be on television."
"it will be the best place, i guess."
"okay, f/8."
the camera was on 1/60th. i hope it - got bumped there.
"no, that's where it's supposed to be for you."
was it?
"yes. 2.8, 1/60th."
"okay. dio, nfident"
you got it? 04 18 40 32 i_ aim my camera out there at about the right spot.
okay. let's see. up there on the rise? be okay?
let's see where you're pointed. 04 18 40 5_ cdr over there on the rise?
okay. let me _oint a little bit further around that way.
"out there in the sunlight, i think, with ..."
okay.
"antares, houston. the flag is going off the c_aera to the right."
"how about that? you back in, houston?"
"al, this is houston. we still show you're off - okay. you're coming back in now."
okay.
"al, we're not going to - we're too far around. we're not going to be able to get it with a 16, al."
"well, we can put it down here close by, if you want."
just put it right out here in front - -
"az.,this is houston. i think it would look a lot - lot better if you could bring it over closer towards the _. 04 18 42 15 _ _t it right here in front of us, al."
okay.
maybe on this - on the tv camera side of the lm shadow.
"roger. age c nfidenti';jjli 5 0h 18 42 31 cc at 01:30, 20 feet."
just about right here.
there you go .... oh 18 42 37 cdr okay.
okay. camera going here.
give me a mark.
mark. it's running. oh 18 h2 57 cc roger. out.
"how's this, bruce? look okay?"
that's a good site.
good. goes in very easily.
"it does, indeed."
you're going off camera to the right.
"that's good. oh 18 43 53 cdr okay. take a picture this way, and then we'll swing it around so they can see it in the television."
"ail right. 04 18 4h 01 cdr okay, let me straighten it around a little, if i can here. 0_ 18 44 02 cc okay we can see it. 0b 18 44 18 cdr okay. there we go. 04 18 44 37 lmi i think i'm still too close to you, al. 04 18 4h 40 cdr watch out for the lr_leg."
yes. cionfidentia
"ok_r. and when you're finished, you can flop it arolmd so they can see it a little better on the tv."
okay.
"okay, and which magazine are you using? *** hasselblad?"
indianapolis-indiana.
"got your feet in the tv cable, al."
roger. indianapolis-indiana; but that was my line.
"al, watch your tv cable."
thank you. 0_ 18 _5 16 lmp and the s-band cable both - got them both. back up. try it again.
"okay, you're clear."
okay. okay. ready?
ready. 04 18 45 h8 cdr okay. got it.
houston. give me a good orientation for the flag.
"what's the final exposure number? ok 18 _6 o1 cdr 25, 25. 04 8 46 02 cc okay, ed. if you just turn us broadside - just turn it broadside to the tv camera with the field to the tv camera right; that is, 180 out from that would be better."
okay.
there you go. you got 25 on the mag.
... al. age3- 6 dnfidenttmm day5
"okay, houston."
that's good on the flag.
okay. 04 18 46 34 l_ did you shut qff 167
"no. 04 18 46 36 l_ okay. 16 is off, bruce. 04 18 46 43 cci stop."
"and there's a little bit left - - 04 18 46 h9 cc you have about 3 minutes remaining on that maga- zine, claremont-california. 04 18 46 54 lm_ roger. we won't change it. okay, i'm going vo press on out for the tv pan, houston."
"and, ed - while ed is doing that, a1 is going to proceed with photographing the landing gear and general features about the lm. oh 18 47 18 cc roger. using indianapolis-indiana."
"okay, houston. i will on my - for my firs% sector per pan, i'll point a little bit more to the south. oh 18 47 38 cc okay. we want to go to a zoom of 25 on this. 04 18 47 k3 lmp roger. 04 18 47 57 i2 okay. you're zoom of 25; focu_ going out toward infinity. and how's your picture, houston? 04 18 48 15 hi? houston, this is ed. al?"
yes.
think we lost comm?
"go ahead, ed."
"okay, how's your picture now? onfident"
roger. it looks good.
okay. can you see the horizon?
".., affirmative. the horizon is about two-thirds of the way up from the bottom of the tube. the flag is over near the left-hand corner of the field of view. and that little rise is sort of centered - -"
"0k_', that's just about where i wanted it."
- - with the small crater off to the left.
"roger. the horizon that you see - far horizon, bruce, is a ridge that seems to run around this bo_ that we're sitting in - appears to be a ridge. it runs down from what we called ""old nameless"" to the south, and it runs to the west. it seems to be roughly circular, but, of course, we could be a little bit deceived at this point, on that - that score. the little rise you see in front of us is a rise that's shown on - on the map with - the craters are on the map. since i don't have it handy, it - i'll have to give you the coordinates later, but i think you already know them. they are about 150 feet south - south ... of the lm. go ahead."
"roger. if you're going to spend several seconds describing each of these locations here after the camera steadies out, you might just as well zoom out a ways, and we'll pick up some features at random on higher magnification, and zoom back in when you go onto the next 45-degree sector."
"okay. ail right, i've moved around to the next sector now. and it's looking down over what we used to call cloverleaf - although it's not obvious from here what the cloverleaf was. there is a fairly significant crater of - about 250 to 300 yards out. i'll try to come - bring it in for you."
"can you see it out there, houston?"
"yes, you're doing fine. keep zooming, if you've ge left"
okay. let's zoom all the way.
well centered.
okay. that crater is - -
"okay. beautiful. oh 18 50 55 lmp - - it's kind of in a low spot, but it's not the lowest spot in this dip that we're in. the lowest spot we will pick up in our next sector, although we'll shoot across it because you won't be able to see it."
"okay, bring her back in."
"okay. now, another sector to the right, facing almost do,m-sun. and-"
"roger. we got your shadow. 04 18 51 25 _ okay. it's a very low spot. the deepest part, i guess, of what we were calling cloverleaf be- fore, although i did not realize how deep that depression was, and i still don't quite get the - -"
"okay, zoom out while you're talking. 04 18 51 50 l_ - - okay. can't quite get the relief in my mind, because it is so different than what i expected. where you're looking at now, this: deep part, is to the south of doublet, and it's probably 75 to 100 feet below where we are, rising up on the far side to above us."
"okay, you're aimed up a little high. 04 18 52 17 i2_p okay. how's that now?"
"a lot better. say, ed, you don't need to stop talking when i talk, if you can do both at once. 04 18 52 24 ixmp okay. i have a little trouble listening to you and talking at you, too. not polite (laughter). okay. i'm bringing it back in and coming around through the west-northwest, and you should be able to see in the distance doublet crater. and i_ve lost it now because of the sun angle, but it's c(j fiden,t iiim just about on the - on the near horizon. i'm sorr2r, there are three mounds, three ridges. the nearside - the nearest one - the ridge that doublet is on and then the far horizon. and i'm bringing them - bringing it on out for you. doublet is on zhe second - second hill that you see. pick it up out there, bruce?"
"roger. we can see the ridges, and i - and i can see _ cra%er that probably is doublet. 04 18 53 24 ijqp okay. we'll zoom back in and move on around; i think ai's about to finish up his task over there."
negative. i'm still working at 8 o'clock.
"oh. 0h 18 53 37 cdr ed, i just wonder how come mccandless has the audacity to presume that we're wrong about doublet crater (laughter)."
"very presumptuous. okay, bruce, i'm coming around one more sector. and you should be able to - i'm going to move it just a little bit more - you should be able to see the large rock, the four or fiw_ rocks i was talking about in my discussion before we got out of the lm. now i'll zoom in on those, if i may. oh 18 54 13 lmp here we come."
"ok_f, now point the camera down a degree or 2."
"ok_. how's that? oh 18 54 29 cc beg_tiful. you might come right a degree or so. i see the small rocks off to the right. okay. 0h 18 54 41 lmp okay. and i might add - i mentioned a quadruplet chain of craters. well, they're right here in front of me - -"
"point it down a little. 04 18 54 52 imp okay. the quadruplet chain of craters starts right here in front of me; well, it's halfway between the rock and myself and moves across here; now, there're quite a few - -"
"you're getting all sky, 04 18 55 07 imp let me zoom back in again."
hold it. 04 18 55 23 imp okay. how's that now?
"good. -.- /2 0h 18 55 29 lmp okay. there's the south quadruplet crater, and _fi-the-_""% t_5_e'x%'?one and the next one and the largest one. you can see - - 3c_ci."

"okay, houstou. a1 is finished with the documenta- tion. counter, 110."
"roger, al. 110, indianapolis-indiana. and, ed, a frame or two ago it looked like one of those rocks was split right down the middle; did you not_ce that, too?"
i don't think it is; i - it may be - it may look like it from there - we'll go by there later on.
roger. let's press on with the tv panorama.
"we're about 2 minutes behind time line at this point, ed. you're looking at sky again. *** her do_n. **_ ed, we're recording all this on video tape so that it only takes a relatively brief period of time looking at the - the scene that we can pl_y it back, frame at a time, later on. *_ 25?"
are you reading me?

ed.
"oh, god."
"ed, this is houston; we're not reading you."
"okay, bruce, now you are; i hit the transmit switch to off. the - -"
"loud and clear. 04 18 59 23 _ the horizon that you see in this view is the north flank leading up to cone crater. it's proba - it's over a mile away - a mile and a half away. i'll give a quick zoom in on it. and then i can't gc any closer to the sun right now. i'm at my limit. age tconfidentiat, ll 04 18 59 39 cdb okay, we're - -"

"let's try about 45 there; we'd like to get %he flag in at the right extremity and the plus-y, if we can, at the left extremity. hold that."
how's that?
"pan left about 2 degrees - 2 degrees. okay, that looks - -"
is that okay?
crank it out about to 40 on the zoom. 0b 19 00 37 i_mp okay.
that's really - -
that's good. 02 19 o0 43 i2_ okay. here i come.
"okay. a1 and ed, if we could get you both in %he field of view there for a minute, we've got a message for you."
okay.
"okay. you're looking lovely, troops. 'ay don't you take a pair and let me pass a message to y_u?"
okay. (onfidentiai.
ok_.
"ok_. we were very pleased a few minutes ago to reo_ive a phone call here in mission control from president nixon. he asked me to extend to you and stu his best congratulations. he said that, like millions of people all over the world, he is an astronaut watcher at this time. the picture is coming in very well at the white house, he said. the president said he knew how many thousands of people had worked on this mission without whom men would not be walking safely on the moon. he asked that i wish the apollo - entire team, well. the president said he was proud of you and proud of them. he sent you a wire just before the flight wishing you godspeed, and he wishes you well on your return flight. the president also asked me to invite you to the w_ite house for dinner and to spend the weekend at camp david with your families after the mission is completed. over."
"that's fine, deke. thank you very much. and we appreciate those kind words."
"thank you, deke. and convey our thanks to the president, please."
"roger. will do. i don't think stu got this, but we'll see he gets it later."
okay. you ready? get the wheels first. 04 19 02 25 i/mp okay.
okay. 0h 19 02 32 lmp wheels out.

okay. put it there.
let's get that .... set up here - there we go.

"hardly worth mentioning. 04 19 03 31 i2,_ agree. 04 19 03 37 cdf okay. houston, as you can see, the mzt is deployed properly."
roger. 0h 19 03 47 cdr looks like it - looks like it's in good shape.
okay. i'll get a camera.
"okay, if you ws_nt to - okay, that's right here - i'll move around to put the tv camera on the scientific equipment bay. 0b 19 03 10 i_p okay."
"antares, houston. we'd like to get an ebgj status report at this point."
"okay. cdr is 3.7 and reading 72_ no flags, i'm on low flow and in good shape. 0h 19 04 31 i2_p and the lmp is 3.7 and reading 67 percent; iow flow, low cooling, and feeling great."
tv camera - -
roger.
"- - tv camera is covered, and proceeding te the rear of the lm to observe the deployment of the alsep."
"okay, houston. the cover is coming off the lens now. how does that look to you? confidentia it"
"roger, al. are you - are you all the way back at the 30-foot position there? ... 30."
"well, it's about - it's abouz 30 right there, i'd say. a little hilly here."
okay. our picture is moving around a lot; you're going to have to set it down and let it stabilize before we can tell you anything about it.
"i'm trying to find a level spot, bruce. we're in- -"
okay. what zoom are you on?
"we're on the side of the hill, as you probably have heard. and it may not stay; it may tip over."
can you poke one of the legs into the surface there?
that's what i'm doing at the moment.
"that's a pretty clumsy tripod, i realize."
"okay. do you know, i think it will stay now? 04 19 07 2_ cdr okay. how's that? oh 19 07 25 cc okay. what zoom are you on? back off the zoom some."
"yes. i think we'll have to. 0h 19 07 42 lmp okay, bruce, can you see the bay?"
wrong way.
i'm ready to start opening.
"roger. i can see your hands very clearly. we seem to be close *** hold that zoom, al. okay. looks good."
okay.

okay.
"looking good though, ed. and you all are within 9 minutes of the time line. 04 19 08 28 imp okay. we'll pick it up here in a little wh_!e. okay. ready with number 1."
"hey. number 1, coming out. 02 19 09 06 imp okay. got her down."
okay. i'm going to move it over a little bit here. 04 19 09 14 i_ okay. it's almost as heavy as you are.
who's talking?
"... move over. man, it's rough to find a level soot to put anything. okay. number 2 is comin_ gut."
"okay, can you get that by yourself?"
"well, it's - i think so. let me - make sure. it's not going to vibrate too much? okay, and it's on the surface. oh, all this beautiful white paint is sure going to get filthy out here. 04 19 11 04 l_ i'll have to bend a little bit. i just can't bend down to that,"
okay. 02 19 12 09 is_p and the handtool carrier's clear. 0b 19 12 12 cc roger. 04 19 12 36 sc/cc ***
"say again, houston."
"nothing, ed. (jonfidentia 04 19 14 10 _ you know, i fully expect to see stu and ron come running around to pick up the pit pins and the thrown-away parts."
see this - okay. i think there's a pretty level place right there.
0ops. excuse me.
"okay, i'm ready for the fuel cask."
okay.
"roger, ed. 04 19 15 17 _ the handtool carrier, as you can undoubtedly see, is on the met. no problems."
okay. temperature indicators on the mast show that there's been no heat.
roger.
and the cask is coming down.
"... ed. 04 19 16 27 _ and it's down far enough, i believe."
"okay, stand by 1. not the best place in the world to work. there we are. 04 19 16 59 i_mp okay, if we can get the lid off of it. 04 19 17 53 _ watch it. that's probably pretty hot. okay, it's locked."
got it? 04 19 18 04 i_mp th:nk so.
"... down a little bit. got a little more in right there. there you go. 04 19 18 25 _ okay, good. houston, the lid is off the nuclear fuel cask. a_ld i have none of them - -"
"did you report tem2_ levels? age3- 8 ""t..onfident 04 19 18 36 _ - - no temp indicators that are,black. you want to take that? got me in midthrow there. okay, it's open."
"okay, the cask ready? 04 19 19 16 cdf okay. ail set."
okay.
this slight slope is about as level as we can get from here. 04 19 19 52 i2dp okay.
"okay, looks good. ail right, a little more this way. there you go. very good. 0h 19 20 21 cdr the reading on that tube? 04 19 20 2h l_ yes. i'll get it in a minute."
"okay. 04 19 20 32 i2_p and, houston, all of the temperature indicaz_rs are still white."
"roger, ed."
"okay, the doors are closed. 0h 19 21 32 _ okay."
"okay, houston. we're going to :lover the teievison camera, load it back to its original location."
"roger, al. for your information, you're approxi- mately 7 minutes behind the time line at this point."
okay.
okay. where do you think's a good spot for the alsep ?
"oh, boy. that's going to be tough, al. i'd just head out toward doublet out there and let's lcok."
which way? 04 19 22 00 l_p rlg_t toward doublet.
"i think that's the best way. aim for the center ,ofdoublet. aim for the - yes, aim for the center of d_ublet, and let's go from there. however, i think maybe we better go a little further south, or we're going to violate that ccig constraint if we go too far north. how about toward the south edge of doublet?"
"hey, why don't you point it - point it at us, and we'll just pick it up on the way out?"
what's that?
"you ought to point it at us, and we'll pick it up on the way out."
"well, we're supposed to - okay, right now - you can put it here and watch the _t deployment, if you like. 04 19 23 29 _ okay."
"okay, houston. we're about - a 40-foot zoom now - on the area of the mesa and the met. how does that look?"
"houston, are you with us?"
"roger. lev's go to 50. 04 19 2h 03 cdr okay, 50."
and come right about 3 degrees. very good.
"okay. oh 19 24 46 cdr okay. got the television camera there? 04 19 24 49 l_ yes, it's down in the bottom."
okay.
"bey, bruce. as i mount these 70-millimeter cameras on the met, i just flip the little spring clip; i just pick up the whole met and drag it along. i can't do that when they get - get a little more weight on there. age-60 cionfid"
"okay. we got that, ed. be sure you get the large scoop on there replaced."
"yes. okay. bruce, i've put on two hasselblads, and i'm going ahead and getting the t6-millimeter on and getting it out of my way right now."
"okay, ed. two hasselblads plus the 16-millimeter."
"right. and i've just started the tv bracket, and i'm open - getting ready to open src number 1. okay. black-and-white television - -"
"and, al, have you gotten - roger."
black-and-white tv camera's on the plus-y strut - on the footpad.
with the white surface normal to the line of the sun?
that's correct. on dimension horizontal.
"roger. roger. and on magazine charlie-char!ie, i show you still have 3 minutes remaining. 04 19 27 04 l_ okay. we'll leave it on there, then."
roger.
"okay, src-1 is open. okay. 04 19 27 41 l_ oh, damn, dropped the weigh bag."
wait a minute. 04 19 27 56 l_ i'll get it.
"i can give you some tongs, if you want them."
"okay. it will probably save *** any dirtier than necessary. well, z dropped both of them. the ***"
okay. may as well put them in the pocket when you're through.
okay. onfident
"okay, houston. magazine double dog and double easy going on the _t. 0h 19 29 30 lmp *** handle."
roger. delta-delta and echo-echo.
"take that baby up a little. 0h 19 29 56 lmp yes .... and while you're getting that ready, let me slip these babies in there."

lift it up with one hand and put it over the other.
that's what i was going to do - this time. 04 19 31 44 i_ip okay. it's a bit longer than expected.
"0k_y, houston. i've got three core tubes, no tabs."
"roger. 04 19 32 k4 cdr and, houston, i finally succeeded in getting two weigh bags. and one sesc in, so far - in addition to the other things, plus the core tube cap assembly. 0_ 19 32 58 cc roger. 04 19 33 10 l_ okay, you putting on the other sesc?"
i've got the other sesc now.
"okay, very good. oh 19 34 04 lm_ the problem here is the clips are so tight tt_% it takes a monumental amount of force to get them in there. course, that's the way we asked for them; can't complain. and, houston, i'm sealing the organic sample at this point."
"roger. oh 19 34 31 cdr okay, antiwe'll put this one in the pocket ...."
"okay, houston. i have the closeup camera. oh 19 35 26 cc roger. still reading on even hundreds? 04 19 35 29 l_ i'm not vhere yet. 04 19 35 hh l_p didn't want that to get away from me, but it did. got it. okay. houston, it's turned on, ana iz's reading 300."

"ed, can you see that little flag all right? oh 19 36 12 lmp yes, i think i can see that. good show."

"okay, let's put that baby over here. that your last item?"
"let me doubleeheck. let's see, 1, 2, 3 - -"
"okay, houston. we'll start a rundown here; i think we are about ready. 0h 19 38 42 lmp yes."
"got the core tube cap assembly, extension handle, two sets of - two sets of tongs. we have a numf.oered geophone anchor on the front. we have the tether, the gnomon, the hammer, the scoop. three core t_es, 35 bag dispensers, closeup camera, two sescs, two 70-millimeter cameras with solar ex- terior, one 16-miilimeter camera and one _g, four weigh bags, two maps, extra number geophone flag, large scoop is on, right. large scoop is on, and we're taking the trenching tool with us."
"okay, and you should have 16-millimeter and two mags."
"tk_t correct; we have a total of, i was just going to say, a total of three _gs; one is almost used and the other two are clean. you with us? you with us?"
roger. looks good.
okay. let me just look at something.
arldwhy don't you give us emu status check before you set out?
"okay, the lmp is reading 3.75 and about 55 percent medium to low - low cooling. doing great."
"okay. say again the percentage, ed. 04 19 40 14 _p it looks like i'm reading 50 - no, sorry about that."
"man, it's hard to see."
"yes. i'm reading 55 percent, bruce. iicon fiden'ii', iim a,'5"
you're reading lower than that. it must be.
roger.
"no, i'm reading more than that. i'm reading 55 percent. 04 19 40 35 cdf you are? okay."
"go ahead, al."
"okay, al is at 3.75, reading 62 percent, and i have no flags; i'm on min cooling and i'm very comfortable."
"roger. out. and we need to point the tv ca,.era out to the alsep site. 04 19 40 56 _qp al, i'll go get it."
"let me zoom on out and get that. i think i'll aim it a little bit to the left of - that bright crater on the side of the west wall of - of doublet. 04 19 41 08 m,ip hey, that's a good place, al."
"say, al, if there's any uncertainty as to the deployment area, we'd rather go to a zoom of 100 instead of a zoom of 150; but if you think you've got a good site picked out now, why, we can go to 150."
"i think we can find a good site. we may be a little closer to doublet than the - than the map shows, because of the grade going up there; but i think there's a level site fairly close to the south rim of doublet, and we'll aim the camera in that general direction and give you 150 zoom. focus at infinity."
roger. out.
"okay. you should be able to see,on the right side of your picture when i settle dcwn here. you should be able to - *** ico nfident,- ttlm"
"al, you can get quite a ways further out, if you want to; youtve got a little cable left."
"*** we're aimed right for the south *** doublet now, south doublet; and you'll probably be able to see *** star crater right in the very edge of your field of view. *** stop okay?"
"yes, f-stop's fine. i've got what looks like two ridges and then the horizon in the picture, and i see a - just past the second ridge - -"
it may be two small boulders.
"okay, may be. 04 19 42 57 l_ okay. i think we can find something out there that fits the bill."
okay. i'll go pick up the barbell.
ail right. the lr cubed is there on the front step.
"al, this is houston. we'd like to try f/22 and peak."
okay_ you caught me just in time.
okay; f/22 and peak. how does that look to you?
"roger_ al. and we'd like to elevate a little bit, so that we get the horizon in. 0k 19 44 31 cdr okay, we'll try. how's that? 0k 19 44 41 cc see if you can depress a little now. it's real touchy at this long focal length. 04 19 4_ 50 cdr okay. we'll try to depress a little bit."
"okay, you still have the horizon? o_ 19 45 20 cc okay, that looks good for elevation; and if you've got us aimed at your proposed deployment site, we're go. age3-66 cj i4fidentia--"
"well, it looks like that's the way we're going. you'll just have to stay in that line of sight, bruce."
okay. very good.
roger. you want a gca_
yes. i think if you aim for a little to the left of that - -
"well, our asr isn't working very well; but if we can once get you in the field of view, we'll acquire you. 04 19 45 59 _p roger. i'm headed over that way."
"can you see *** yet, bruce_"
"negative, ed. i believe you're off to our left. 04 19 47 08 _p they won'v get in the field of view until we get up pretty close to the site. okay."
"okay. you're coming in now. 04 1_ 47 13 lm? okay. i'm going to stop here and rest for a minute, al. this darn thing is heavier than i expected."
"okay, ed. we've got you in the field of view cvet to the left, now."
"okay. a1 should be coming in right now, too. c4 19 47 49 cdr looks as if it might be a little secondary impact crater here by me."
"man, there's so many different t_.pes of craters around here, you could - we could spend the whole eva within a hundred yards of the lm. okay, lead on and i'll follow and watch the met for you."
okay. going to your right.
"okay, houston. we're proceeding over a very fine- grain regolith we described before. undulating surface getting more sloped - - tonfident"
oka_. you need to angle left just a little bit. 04 19 h8 40 cdr left?
"yes, you're doing fine, now. o_ 19 48 49 lmp say, houston. this looks like brown talcum powder; it's so fine in most places. 0_ 19 49 01 cdr i think the sun angle is increasing now."
"the m_t's going off to the right. 0_ 19 49 04 cdr the met's trying to find a smooth place to go. 02 19 49 09 l_ al, i think you'll have to go around this crater, here, to the left. i think we can find our way dorm. good heavens, that's a deep hole. but i guess we can get it - make it, either way."
say again.
"i said we could make it, either way. 04 19 _9 35 cdr okay. 04 19 49 43 _mp see those two over there at 10 o'clock? al, we can see those are on the map."
the two at 10 o'clock?
yes.
"yes. okay, houston. we'll be dropping down out of sight for a while, probably. going down in - in a depression. o_ 19 50 27 cdr well, i don't know. 04 19 50 30 lm1d i don't know either. let's stop a minute, al."
i'm not sure but what we've picked just about as gcod a spot as anywhere. 04 19 50 38 lm_ i think so.
"it looked a little further out here, because of being closer to zero phase, perhaps. age3-68 ionfidentiat4i"
"i think that's it, but it's no1;a bit smoother than the other. i'll be darned if i know what to do. 04 _9 51 02 cdr well, we'll move on a little closer to doublet."
okay. okay.
"well, i think the first ridge over there, about another 75 yards, might be our answer. right beyond this next - these next two craters. 04 19 51 47 cd_ yes, i think so. it's probably a pretty good spot. about right up there. 04 19 51 52 _4_ yes."
"okay, houston. we're in the general area of the planned alsep deployment now - on the chart, it's in a depression, and i think we'll move on a little closer to doublet to give it a zhigher elevation. 0_ 19 52 18 cc roger. you're visible from - about the armpits up, right now."
okay.
"think you ought to press a little - bear a little to the left, al."
"yes. i guess we'll have to. nothing like being up to your armpits in lunar dust,."
"i think just to the left of that rock that's ahead of us, it provides a path through here."
"the met seems to be riding very well, houston. it's bouncing a little bit, making nice tire marks, but not about to turn over. it jumps about a foot every time it hits a small rise, but very stable."
"are you getting any dust thrown up by the tires? 0_ 19 53 23 lmp no. there is a little bit, bruce, but it's not - the dirt feels to be kind of clumpy. 0_ 19 53 51 cdr okay, i guess that ridge is the best place. tonfideni oh 19 53 54 lmp i think so."
how are you doing? oh 19 53 56 lmp fine.
you still on your television_ bruce?
"yes, indeed. you're very well centered."
"*** ought to be coming back in now; we're coming up to - the grade here. oh 19 54 14 cc roger. i can see your shadows now, so - i guess - in fact, i can see your feet; so, you're well in view. 04 19 54 21 _p okay, about another 30, 40 feet now, and i think we're as good as we're going to get."
"yes. _at we're discussing here, houston, is - grade going up to south doublet. it is very consistent, and it's difficult to find a level place."
"okay. let's set it down and look for a minute, al."
all righty.
"%hen, we can see here where we are. oh 19 55 07 lmp i don't know but what this - this rise we're standing on right here - it's about as good as ar_. okay, now, there's a 20-meter crater there."
"okay. you got that other map on there, too?"
"yes, it's in the pocket. now, let's see. okay, the one - that one rigb_ - right there. let's see if we carlfind those. the big one. may i see i_ a minute? can we spot that one and those two?"
"that one's right over there, i believe. isn't it? taat's an old rounder one right there. see what i mean? 7 jlifidential"
"yes, that may be. what's this one right here? that one right beside it. oh, i don't know whether we're that far out or not, al."
"... that little, looking for that little distance thing. here we go."
"okay, i'd say we're probably about 400 feet out, almost directly out in front. plus-x."
okay.
...
i think ... 80 meters along the track. 04 19 57 37 _dp look here. see that crater right in between those two traverse tracks?
yes.
"okay, those two craters and that crater that you pointed out."
right. 04 19 57 46 l_ okay_ i think that one between the traverse tracks is that one right there.
okay.
"on the hill, the two - those right over there and the one you pointed out, this one, is that one over there, the big one behind it. now, i think it's out of sight, unless it's that one over thera."
"well, where do you think we are_"
"i think that we are to the north - i think we're about br; and, let's see, we're south of that - we're about cq 0.8 and 62.5 - 61.5. oh 19 58 35 cdr did you read that, houston2"
"roger. charlie quebec 8 at 61.5 nfidenti,/ii i"

"okay, let's put it right up in there. 04 19 58 59 lhp righ% up there, on that spot? 04 19 _9 o1 cdr yes, you got it. okay, houston. wetre going to move about 10 meters to the west-northwest from those coordinates th._t ed gave you. that will be waere the alsep central station will go. we reserve the right to change our mind as to where we are, when we get up on the hilltop. o_ 19 59 26 cc okay."

"yes. we understand, but it's all pretty much the same; the upslope is abcut - _ or 5 degrees, a,e tonfidenti ii day pockmarked by all types of craters. they're all old craters; but, nonetheless, they produce a very uneven surface. and i think we've found a spit here as reasonable as we'll find an_-_here."

"roger. copy, ed. 05 12 03 06 imp *** i'm back at the met."
and the clock is starting.
okay.
"and, white we got a few seconds there, ed. the raindrop pattern you mentioned_ was it - is it pretty general or is it just here and there that you noticed this texture? 05 12 03 38 _4f no, it seems to be fairly general, fred."
"okay, houston, the tds sampling: is complete, and the final counter, closeup, is reaciing 311."
"roger, al. i copied on 1001, serial n_mber final count, 311. and ed, you can - you're go for the readings. 05 12 04 16 _p okay."
"get in there, baby. okay. 05 12 04 26 _p okay, fredo. on high scale again; x, 01.i - hold it."

"okay, i got closeup shots: 12, 13, and 14; and 12 - all at 9 o'clock shadow; 12 and la are two typical examples of the rain_rop-textured pattern which ed - of which he spoke. now, 13 is a picture of a foot track - - 05 12 06 lc _4p ... tconfidentiaji"
- - foot track in the same - area.
and i see some - -
"roger, al."
i see a fairly large rock here at the - at the north of these three craters. it's embedded right at the rim. it's about 2 feet long. i can see some crys- tals in it. it has a good fillet pattern. i'm shooting a closeup of that. and the sun angle again will be 9 o'clock.
"roger, al."
"okay, and al, a word from the backroom says go at least two crater dis_meters away from - i guess, the crater you're just describing, when you get ready to take the double core."
"okay, we'll try to put it in the center of the three craters to get all three - well, to get whatever stratigraphy we have here. and the last fillets - picture, shadow 9 o'clock - was 18."
*** al.
"k_y. and since i've already taken a couple of pistures of the met tracks, i won't do any more cf that here, and probably won't again unless we see some difference in zhese tracks. they're - they're fairly what you might expect, because they're smooth; they're well packed and vary in depth only as a function of the - of the surface tension. 05 12 08 22 i24p fredo, i've left the lpm, returning to the met. had a little trouble with it that time. the bubble is tangent on the east side of - of the center ring."

*** the mazter?
this is a can cf worms.
"you're having some problem reeling it in there, ed?"
"yes. an awful lot of problem with it, fred. the set in the cable is so much that if i ever let go of the handle, it winds down about three or four turns on me; and i have to - at least - then i have to take it back out. and the cable is all bunched up and curled out here. it's - i'm not sure i'm going to get wound or not."
"roger, ed."
*** a different method of holding it.
"okay, houstcn. a couple of quick stereos in the locater of the core tube as it's about to be driven, and the locater of the m_ is in the background."
*** al.
"okay, fredo. z got the lpm reel reeled in just enoagh to keep it off the ground. i'm trailing a can of spaghetti here."
"okay, ed."
"al, you haven'z taken a pan, have you?"
no.
okay. i'm starting with the pan.
"okay. just in the way of bookkeeping, we need the double core and the pan and a sample. pag4e-3 ! confidentiadii 05 i2 16 42 i_mp okay."
"okay, houston. we got almost two complete - tubes here, about one and seven-eighths tubes, i would say."
"roger, al."

"okay. we copied, a1 and ed."
"okay. and the core bit, just for the fun of it, is going in bag 2-november. 35 12 19 51 i_mp we need a dac."
"and, al, they'd like a description of the surface where you drove the core tube. c5 12 20 29 cdr okay, fred. nothing, but it's titlesr_metextured pattern of which we spoke coming up in this traverse. c5 12 20 _4 i_mp uh oh. c5 12 20 46 cdr what? 05 12 20 47 imp where's ou_- color chart?"
"here yo'a go. did you read the core tip *** 2-november, fred? confidential,,,,"
"roge:_, al. we've got that, and for your information, we're about 5 minutes behind in the total time :line, for departing a."
"okay. continuir_ - our description of the surface, it _ppears to be a scat%ered population of very small blocks, some of which ed is going to photo- graph here, and his documented sample. i believe they came from zhe crater to the north of the sampling sites. other than that, the - that little core-sample site is not uni$_e to the traverse, so far. the first core went in fairly easily. i had some *** difficulty with the last core."
"roger, al."
okay. ***
get zhat by yourself?
yes.
"and,.houston, the rock i'm sampling is a - seems to be a fairly typical one of this little crater - multiple crater that we're working around, right now, near a; and it's goirg into the bag 3-november."
"roger, ed. copy 3-november."
ocps. it's breaking apart on me as i pick it up. i'll try to get most of the pieces.
"*** ed. and *** we need to move on here to b; and before we depart a, we're going to need an huu check."
ok_f. this is al's 5mi3reading 3.75; oxygen is reading 71; i have no flags; i'm on min cooling; and i'm comfortable.
al.
yes.
can you hand me another baggy?
"okay. pag e,-34 t onfident'ia: da6y"
"houston, i can't get all of this sample in 3-n. consequently, it will go into 3-n and the next one. it looked like it was fractured; and when i picked it up, it fractured into about four pieces."
okay.
"roger, ed."
okay. now head on up the hill 'ilob. 05 12 26 lk _ okay.
"okay. and we still need an _u cheek from yo_, ed. 05 12 26 22 _p okay, fredo. give it to you in a minute. 05 12 26 29 2dr can you catch up with me all right?"
"yes, i'll catch up. go ahead."
"okay. a1 is heading up with th_ met_. from a, we go down into a valley. we drop down a - a fairly consistent slope of approximately, oh, 8 to 10 de- grees. the texture, here again, is pretty much the same on the surface. the basic regolith, of course is - of comrse, is the fine material which is now, at this particular sun angle, kind of a grayish _rown, with the light pebbles on the sur- face making the raindrop - the small pebbles on the surface making the raindrop pattern."
"and, houston, i'm - i'm treading along behini a1 now, starting to catch up with him. it - it hasn't been described for you before; the met tracks make a very smooth pattern in the - in the surface, reminiscent of - of driving a tractor through a plowed field. it smooths it out and makes a very smooth, distinct pattern, and probably, oh, a quarter of an inch deep, no more. 05 12 28 o0 2c roger, ed."
and it leaves gaps every now and then as it _cunces.
think you've found b? jconfidenti
"yes. it's this - this big crater over here, isn't it?"
it's way up the hill.
pardon?
"i think it's up the hill. 05 12 28 23 _ oh, that's right. b is the crater we go - this is the crater we go by on the way to b."
"roger. 05 t2 28 45 cdr okay, houston. i'm locking for a contact somewhere in here, but it's not apparent at this point. sur- face texture seems to be very much the same; *** the standpoint of *** bearing properties, it's still about the same softness; and it still has the same raindrop pattern."
"roger, al."
"oh, fredo. you wanted a mi check from me. i'm at 3.7, going 67 percent. i'm on min cooling; no flaes."
"roger, ed. 05 12 29 38 i_4p and continuing the description a little bit, houston. the - trying - trying to think of an adequate de- scription or comparison to something we've already seen, but i don't think there is one. incidentally, i see a string of craters down to the south - a string of boulders to the south of us that may prove to be a ray pattern as we - from cone. and i observe, as we get closer to the - to cone, the number of large boulders is increasing. we're going to go past some here in a couple of minutes - near a - about a 20-foot-wide, fairly fresh crater. the boulders - a dozen of them or so - are 4 or 5 feet in diameter. lot of filleting around them."
"ro_er, ed."
"okay. let's see if we can find this - 6 _age4-36 %__ _ay 05 12 30 hl lmp this crater's the one, i think, al. it's halfway between a and b, isn't it?"
"yes, i think so. this little - -"
can you see the boulders off to the side there on the map?
"no, they don't show very well. i think -"
ah_ you should be able to spot that little chain of craters just to the south of it. on the map - if that - if that's where we think we are.
"ed, i donmt see any craters right: there. 35 12 31 29 _p kind of small."
"that will make us right here, hu_z? 05 12 31 32 _p pardon?"
"there's nc,big one to go with it. a sharp one ts go with it. this is that one right up there. hsw about that? 05 12 31 h8 lmp yes. let's take a look."
"that's probably weird right up there. we're pr3b- , ably about even with weird right now, although we can't see it on the ridge."
"that's weird, that big one right sver there, _1."
"yes, that's what i say. i think b is that deep crater right directly ahead of us, ed. c5 12 32 05 _p nc, i disagree. i think - see that crater right over there we came by? to the south, the big cne?"
yes.
"i think this is the crater that's at - that's at b. i think this boulder field, we can see it here, if you look. $,onfidentia"
!this crater right here?
"yes. yes, we have to he considerably past weird."
"not even halfway to the - to the rim of cone yet. 05 12 32 43 i24p yes, this place all looks alike out here."
"well, let's go on ahead - -"
"and, a1 and ed. i don't - yes. i don't think you have to worry too much about the exact position of site b. if you're - it appears you're getting close to the general area, that should be good enough on"
"okay. i think we're very close to it. i think this crater we just went by is probably it, but it's;very hard to tell_ fredo. i don't see any- thir_ else that might be it, unless it's the next crater up. al, i've spotted it. that crater - next crater up is this one right here."
which way are you pointing?
pardon?
where at?
right behind you. that crater is that crater right up there. that crater is the crater over to the left of it.
"%there do you think b is? 05 12 33 40 lm_ i think b's the one we just passed, back there where we were %alking."
"ail right. 05 12 33 46 i_mp and here's the little - aha, it is here's the little double crater right beside it. look here. see, there's t:hat crater; see, there's the little double crater; it's right there in front of you."
"0ks_, let's go sample b. pag4e-38 confident bj 6"
let's sample b.
okay - -
"okay. and, a1 and ed, this is a grab sample at b, and we need the panorama. and while someone is doing that, we can get our site description. 05 12 3h 20 cdr i'll get a pan, then. 05 12 34 21 lm_ okay. and while a1 takes the _:an, i'll go ahead and give you a site description. the area here is an area of considerably more boulders, a larger boulder field, more numerous boulders than we've seen in the past. we've just come into it as we - as we approached b from a. now, there are - _here were boulders to the north of us; we previously talked of boulders to the north; and, doggone it, they may turn out to be a ray pattern. it i_ks suspiciously like - like one. however, where we are now, we're about on the edge of a genera boulder population lining the flank of cone crater. now, they're not too numerous at this poina. they're somewhat patchy. there's a lot of tham buried, half buried, a few of the smaller ones sitting oa the surface. there are - these boulders are fiiletei, and we'll have to sample that filleting later. the surface texture - the fine is very much - appears very much the same as what we've been walking on all along. and about the only difference we can see is probably a larger number of smaller craters, i say probably; they're so numerous, unless you really make a population count, you can't tell. a large - i'm guessing, a larger number sf craters - _rohably secondaries from cone, perhaps- and certainly a larger number of boulders lying around. now, most of these boulders are rounded; there are a few angular ones; there are a few rocks with angulars but - angularities - but, by and large, you can see edges that have been chipped off, indicating the beginning of a smoothing process. and some of thegn are far beyond the beginning of smoothing. they're - they're worn down pretty well and most of the rough edges are where they have frastured aha per- haps turned over. most of them appear to be along fractures of where other rocks are sitting near them that might have once been a part of _hat boul- der. out. confidentiaty"
"roger, ed. and has a1 got the grab sample completed now?"
he's - -
i'm grabbing it now.
- - grabbing it now.
"houston, give you a quick stereo on it."
"okay. and we need the fine count before departing b; and, right now, we're about 15 minutes behind in the time line."
"okay. fredo, we expect we're going to fall behind you; there's no way we can help it. we'll pick it up later."
"well, we'll see about that."
"0ka;_. grab sample from the west rim of bravo crater, bag 5-november."
"and, fredc, to complete this description - -"
*** a1 - -
"- - we are standing on a fairly high point - well, not really on a high point, about halfway up the slope. to our north and slightly to the west of us seams to be the low point in this area. it's surrounded by a rim that's reminiscent of a very, very old crater. topography doesn't show up on the map, but indeed is there. about 500 yards to the north and - and west is the lowest point that i can see in this area. okay, you ready to press on?"
as soon as i get my handle screwed back on here.
"okay, the next stop is the top of cone. let's get everything secured for that trip."
"okay, houston- -"
okay. and we'd like the frame count before you depart. age -40 (onfidentt 6

okay. jjonfidenttaw
"ok_r, and -"
"houston, as we go across here, this ground is - al's probably previously described it_ but it's ve_f undulating. i would suspect that there is not 10 yards, at the most, between what were once old craters. they are, most of them, worn down 9 but the surface is continuously undulating. there's hardly a level spot anywhere."
"roger, ed."
"lots of - as we come on up toward cone, we're getting to seeing lots more buried rocks, bigger rocks."
"we're keeping our eyes open for a contact here. but i guess the sun angle makes it very difficult to see. however, i expect that by the time we get a little closer up to flank - let me pull it fora while."
i have to shift hands. i'm good.
"oks_. by the time we get a little closer up to flank, we might find some kind of a contact. the e_e of cone crater to the north is very apparent, as we expected that it would be. it stretches off into the distance and meets with the far horizon."
"roger, al."
"fredo, i'm trying to find something distinctive to say about some of these craters we're going by, and it's very hard to do so. they're all smooth- walled except the very freshest one; and we're coming by a w_ry fresh one now, which is rubbtely on the in - hey! it may even - that has some pretty good chunks of rubble on the inside. this is about the freshest crater this size we've seen, al. 05 12 _2 14 cdr that's correct. this is a very fresh crater. it's about ... it's about opposite to the crater at stop e. it's a crater about 20 meters in diame- ter and about 2 meters deep, and i'll get a quick - rcck from the side. l! 05 12 42 40 imp very soft, too. a1 just dropped dcwn on a knee - -"

"okay, baby! _ 12 43 _2 :th ckay, i got it. c5 12 43 22 mp almost turned, didn't it?"
"yes now that grab sample from the west rim of the crater, *** described as blocky, is in bag 6."
"roger, al. bag 6."
"okay, the going is still very smooth as far as the - the area that we're able to pick out. of co_urse, we're tracing a kind of sinuous course hers, staying out of the craters."
"and, fredo, we're - to help further locate us, if ycu can, we're going by two very - well, fairly fresh craters. i don't think quite as fresh as the one we were just talking about. the eastmost one is fresher than - the westmost one is the freshest. they're separated about 75 to 100 feet, and they're about 25 to 30 feet across and 5 or 6 feet deep - 5 feet deep, i guess. the westmost one has got small blocks in it. the eastmost one is very smooth (heavy breathing)."
"roger, ed. and you described the blocks there a couple of times now. i think you used the term ""rubble."" by that, i assume you implied they were just lying loose, just nothing really in place. 05 12 45 24 i_p i'm not sure that's quite true, fred. some of it looked like stuff that belonged there, that had not; fallen there."
"there's a lot of glass in that rock, ed. 05 12 45 34 limp yes. oh, there sure is. it looked like - some of that so-called rubble looked like it had - might. be the - the residual of an impact just lying in the bottom. and, houston, we're passing a rock mu:h too big to pick up. there's a whale of a lot of glass in it."
it was splattered with glass. 05 12 45 54 limp yes.

"take a what? 05 12 46 24 _p we haven't taken any pictures s_nce the las_ one, i don't think."

"... 05 12 52 33 _p i think it's dead ahead of you, al. oh, wait a minute. this is probably it, right here. yes. d5 12 52 41 cdr am i right? 5 12 52 42 lm yes. let's just doublecheck and see. 5 12 52 47 cdr it's got a - about a h-meter-radius crater in the - in the south wall. 5 12 52 59 _p tha_ has to be it. 5 12 53 03 cdr okay, houston. we're going by flank on the way up. we're passing to the north :sideof it."
"roger ... 05 12 53 18 _dr fred, you're still unreadable. onfidentiaw"
"let me pull awhile, al. you're having all the fun."
"well, we still have a little way to go."
yes_ we sure do. putting the map away.
huh_
i'm just putting the map away.
ail righty.
"okay. fredo, you back with us?"
"okay, i'll try again. how do you read, ed?"
okay. that's much better. you got a background squeal.
"okay. evidently, that station switch gave us some problems. i've been ccpying ***"
"okay. we've been copying you most of the time, and i have you by a point now."
that's affirmative. and the grade is getting pretty steep.
"and the soil here is a bit firmer, i think, than we'_e been on before. except around what - the mounds in between craters where it's been thrown out. but, by and large, it seems to have a little firmer footing. we're not sinking in as deep. 05 12 55 h7 cc that should help you with the climb there."
"yes, it helps a little bit. al's picked up the - al's got the back of the _tet now, and we're carry- ing it up. i 'think it seems easier."
"left, right, left, right."
there's two guys here that figured you'd carry it up. age day6
say again?
said there's two guys sitting next to me here that kind of figured you'd end up carrying it up.
"well, it'll roll along here, except we can just move faster carrying it."
okay. you want to rest here by this rock?
okay.
*** i think it's worthwhile taking a picture of it with the closeup. go ahead and keep going.
"i'll pull on up. we probably ought to take a pan to locate everything here while ;you're taking a closeup (heavy breathing). okay, you get that - -"
"okay. i understand, al. you're shooting a 31oseup shot of a big boulder."
"about what's the size of this one, al?"
"okay. the shot's been taken on the closeup, counter number 317. sun angle was 8 o'clock. the - this particular one is only about 12 feet long by about 4 feet wide. it's about one-third buried. it's old, very weathered. there are some evidences of some crystal shining through some of the fractures."
and i'm taking a hasselblad of the rock and will take a pan now - at - from this location. help document our course going to the top of cone crater.
roger. copy.
"and i can look right across into the breach in the north rim of 01d nameless. we're about even with it, now. and my frame - -"
"okay, and copied, ed. and was there any noticeable dust on the large boulder?"
"not where i took the picture, bu_ some fillets around the bottom. ieonfident ."
"okay, copy and ,out."
"okay. and 44, fred, was my frame count. i believe that was - if i remember it."
"roger, ed. 05 12 59 37 imp now, i'm going to move on out. al's ahead of me here."
"okay. we're starting up the last flank of the crater now, houston. the slope is probably about - oh, 18 percent. the surface texture is still pretty much the same, as far as the raindrop pat- tern is concerned. but we seem to find an increas- ing populavion of small rocks."
small rocks and smaller - -
"roger, al."
"- - smaller, fresher craters, as well. well - well, wait a minute; maybe i'm being deceived. with this slope, the sun angle is entirely differ- ent than it is on the flat land. the craters look shy'per in these shadows (heavy breathing)."
okay. let's mske an t_u stop.
ok_r. let me pull awhile.
i'd like to stop and rest here for a minute.
okay.
"boy, i tell you, we're really going to get a pan- or_na. we've got a tremendous one here, houston, already. and we're not quite to the rim. head towards out sic old nameless over there, right along our track - or just south of our track, i shoald say. we made the right approach; we came up through the valley and over the range and down into the bowl. couldn't have planned it better."
"i thought we were in a low spot with the im, but it turns out we're really not in the lowest spot around, i don't think. age jonfidential 6"
"well, i don't know. i tell you_, it's probably the lowest spot right -"
"oh, right in that particular local area."
"right in _hat area, yes."
but that's the low spot over to the right that i was talking about. and there's a low spot - -
"well, there's a crater over there. it's true, yes."
"yes. yes. doggone it, you can sure be deceived by slopes here. the sun angle is very deceiving."
yes.
"okay, let me pull awhile. you ready to go?"
yes. all set.
"go back to m_in cool, minimum cocl first."
i guess right straight up is the best way to go.
beg your pardon?
right straight up is the best way to go.
"yes, i think so."
stay away from the rocks.
okay. get a little momentum going.
"okay, houston. we're proceeding onward now."
"roger, al."
"and the boulder fields that a1 pointed out - the rocks and boulders are getting more numerous toward the top here. however, it's nothing like the rubble and the large boulders that we saw at the nevada test site. now, this is surprising to me. i expected it to be more lillethat. but it is not, at least, not where we're lcoking now (heavy breathing). jonfidential"
"wel-., we haven't reached the rim, yet."
"oh boy, we got fooled on that one. i'm not sure tha_;was flank we were in a minute ago, either (heavy breathing). wait a minute. yes, it is. the rim's right here. that's the - that's the eas"":- little shoulder running down from the cone. tha-5's flank over there (heavy breathing). we're going to hit ii;on the south side. we'll have to move on around it. this looks like easy going right here. see, there's the boulder field that shows in the photograph - right up ahead of us?"
"there's a crater up there, ed."
yes. pardon?
crater up there.
"okay, a1 and ed. they'd like you to take another stop here."
okay. we're really going up a pretty steep slope here.
yes. we kind of figured that from listening to you.
"okay. well, now, that's apparently the rim of cone over there. and we're about - almost 2 hours now. is that right, fred?"
"ok&y. we're showing 1:57 and a half now, al."
okaqf. that's at least 30 minutes up there.
ye_;.
"and - i would say we'd probably do better to go up to those boulders there, document that, use that as the t_mnaround point."
"ye.'_. it's going to take longer than we expected. otu_positions are all in doubt now, fredo. what we were looking at was a flank, but it wasn't really - the top of it wasn't the rim of cone. we've got a ways to go, yet. age ! confidenti a )ay6"
"well, perhaps you can think - -"
"okay, ed. and - -"
"- - perhaps you can think with us, if you want. i'd say that the rim is at leas_ 30 minutes away. we're approaching the edge of the boulder field here on the south flank."
let's look at that map.
"and what i'm proposing is perhaps we use that as the turnaround point. it seems to me that we spend an awful lot of time on traverse if we don't, and we don't get very many samples."
"roger, al. and, just a couple of questions they have up now. they'd like your note, if you do see any dust, particularly on the top surfaces of boulders in the - in the area. and, any compari- sons between the boulders you see distributed around. are they all the same or do some t_pes appear different?"
"*** we're not really in that bo_alder territory, yet."
"i think, fredo, if you'll keep _;hose questions in mind, the best thing for us to do is to get up _lere and doc_mpnt - and sample - what i feel is pretty sure is cone ejecta. and then, when we head down-sun, we'll be able to see these subtle variations and rock types a lot better than we are right now."
"roger, al."
"well, let's head for these two babies up here."
"hey, al?"
yes.
"i'd - #** keep going around this crater, but - except you're right here."
"well, maybe. i thought we'd get those boulders up there, ed. they - - itconfidentia"
yes.
- - undoubtedly came from - -
yes. let's head right for that boulder field at the top. i think we'll be where we want to be.
right here.
pardon?
right here.
"yes, right - clear on up at the top, you mean."
no. 05 t3 09 12 lmp huh?
i don't think we'll have time to go up there.
"oh, let's give it a whirl. gee whiz. we can't stop without looking into cone crater."
yes.
*** everyvhing if we don't get there.
i think we'll waste ar.awful lot of time traveling and not much documenting.
"well, the information we're going to find, i think, is going to be right on top."
we establish -
"okay, ed. look at this - you're going through - just kicked up a layer of some very light gray fine underneath the -"
"yes. as you look back along your path, there's quite a bit of it."
"yes, this crater -"
"fredo, how far behind time line are we? age ,-54 tconfidet' tia' 6"
"okay. the best i can tell right now - about 25 minutes down, now."
okay.
we'll be an hour down by the time we get to the top of that thing. you got six samples.
"well, i think we're going to find what we're lock- ing for up there."
"okay, a1 and ed. in view of youn:'assay of the - where you_' location is and how long it's going to take to get to cone, the word from the backrcom is they'd like you to consider where you are the edge of cone crater. c5 13 11 11 lmp think you're finks."
"that decision, i guess, was based on al's estimate of another, at least, 30 minutes; and, of course, we - we cannot see that from here. it's kind of your judgment on that."
"well, we're three-quarters there."
"why don't we lose our bet_ al, and leave the m_t and get on up there? we could ma_e it a lot faster without it."
"no. i think what we're looking at right here in this boulder field, ed, is the stuff that's ejected from cone. 05 13 12 13 lmi but not the lowermost part, which is what we're interested in."
"okay. we'll press on a little farther, houston. and keep your eye on the time."
"okay. and, as of right now, we have a 30-minute extension."
"and al, did you copy 30-minute extension?"
we got it. iconfidential
"yes. that's affirmative, fred. thank you."
ok_. stop at this little rise here and take a panorama.
ok_r.
"0k_t, al's going to medium flow."
"ok_, i'll take a pan from here."
"roger, ed."
"well, i'll tell you, it's a fantastic view from here, as this pan will show."
"we're approaching the edge of the rugged boulder field to the west rim. it appears as though the best for us to do will be go to the west rim and document from there, even though the sun angle may not be quite as good. well, we're pressing on in that direction. al's back to min flow."
"roger, al. you're moving to the west rim."
"al's back to _n flow, and we're moving again."
"and, a1 and ed, deke says he'll cover the bet if you'll drop the met."
it's not that hard with the met. we need those tools.
"no, the met's not slowing us down, houston. it's just a question of time. we'll get there."
"roger, al. 05 lb 16 37 lmp give you a hand, al."
it's all right.
you caught a boulder with your wheel as you went _round that corner (heavy breathing).
al?
yes.
head left. it's right up there.
yes. i'm going there.
you need a little more lift. go right up through there. i'll give you a hand.
okay. we're now right in the middle of the boulder field on the west rim. we haven't qui%e reached the rim yet.
okay. want to rest here a minute?
yes. lev's take a look at the map. i think we're closer than that (heavy breathing).
"okay, i'll just go ahead slowly with this."
okay. find the crater?
yes. the rim's right up here.
"let's see if we can spot this one, a1 - -"
okay. 05 13 19 41 __2qp - - on the map.
"okay. and, al, it looks like you'd be a little more comfortable there if you're, on intermediate."
yes. okay. we're resting now. 05 13 19 57 _ look. let me show you something.
okay.
here's that crater. we're down here. we got to go there.
what crater?
that crater right there is that one right there.
okay. want to pull for a while? onfidentia_ti41
yes.
"okay. we're absut the mmximum elevation now, houston. it's leveled out a little bit. and it looks like we'll be approaching the rim here very shortly."
"roger, al. and you can leave the dial in inter- b_diate. we're fat on the - for the feedwater."
okay. thank you.
"let me set mine. if we're in that good a shape, let me set mine, houston, if i'm okay, too."
"that's affirm, ed. i guess the iow item is the bat'_eries."
okay.
"0opx it's going over. no, got it."
"fantastic stabilization, al; it's going to turn ove r."
okay. we better reconnoiter here. i don't see the crater yet.
i agree. *** rock under my wheels.
"see this boulder pattern and all that we're in here, right now? this boulder field and all?"
i thought it was on the south rim.
"and, a1 and ed, do you have the rim in sight at this time?"
oh. yes.
that's affirmative. it's down in the valley.
i'n sorry. you misunderstood the question. i me_lnt the rim of cone crater.
"oh, the rim. this is negative. we don't - haven't found that yet. tonfidenti/ j-"
"this big boulder right here, al,,which stands out bigger than anything else - ought to be - ought to be able to see it."
"well, i don't know but what the rim is still - way up there from the looks of things."
"and, ed and al, we've already eaten in our 30-minute extension, and we're past that now. i think we'd better proceed with the sampling and continue with the eva."
"okay, fredo."
okay. we'll observe with a pan from here. i'll take that.
"all right, i'll start sampling."
"okay, houston. we are in the middle of a fairly large boulder field. it covers perhaps as much as a square mile. and - as the pan will show, i don't believe we've quite reached the rim yet, although we can't be too far away. and i think, certainly, we'll find that these samples are pretty far down in cone crater."
"roger, al."
"okay. come on. 05 13 25 33 _dr okay, you about to start taking documented samples?"
right here.
"ail righty. i would say, houston, that most of these boulders are the same brow_lish gray that we've fouu_d. but we see one that is definitely almost white in color. a very definite differ- ence in color, which we'll document. we noticed that beneath this dark brown regolith, there is a very light brown layer. and i think we'll get a - a core tube right here to show that. as a matter of fact, i think i'll do that right now."
"roger, al. and for your information, we won't be doing the polarimetric experiment. dnfidenti"
"i understand, you will not be."
that's affirm. you can delete that one.
"()kay, al's going back to min cool."
"roge;r, al. and_ ed, i need an opinion. do you think you'd be able to deploy and take the second ;_nd last lpm reading at this location?"
"yes, we can take it at this location."
"okay. what i have on the board here to perform at - i guess we'll call it c-prime - is a sample, and i guess you already got a pan - i thought some- body did - and the lpm then."
okay.
"okay. let me suggest that we take one of these football-sized rocks from here, too, fredo."
yes
"roger, al. vez7 good."
this area that we're in right now is - we're sam- pling in - is a pretty darn rugged boulder-strewn area. one of the smaller rocks i've sampled is goi:ag into 7-n.
"and, a1 and ed. when you can work it in, we'd like and emu check."
"okay. al, 3.7!5and reading 52 on the oxygen; and i'm in medium flow and i'm comfortable; no flags."
"okay. i'm reading 3.75, i'm 48 on oxygen; i'm now at min flow, having just shifted; and i'm comfort- able. 05 13 29 47 i_mp okay. lpm deploy."
roger.
"okay. the core-tube sample turned out to only be about three-quarters of a tube. the area is ap- parently very rocky, but i did get down into the pag-e60 /i,jlfill_,i_ iiil, lllll_ ill i?1 a i _- 6 second layer, the underlying layer, of the regolith, which was white as opposed to being dark brown."
"roger, al. understand you got down to another layer that looked white below the dark brown."
"on second thought, forget that core tube. it's too granular, and most of the material came out of the tube. i'll just scoop a couple of samples, and bag it, of the two top layers."
"roger, al."
"hey, fredo; i'm having a hard time leveling the -"
"okay- - 05 13 31 49 lm_ okay, there it is."
"_lnd, al. about what sample bag number are you up to now?"
7-n was the last one i put in.
"okay, fredo, we're up on 12 here. i don't know whether that's consecutive or not, apparently not."
"okay, fredo, i'm - i'm back at the _._t, having left the lpm; took my time."
the lpm is alined about 3 degree3 - -
"roger, ed. 05 13 32 41 _mp - - 3 degrees to the north of the east-west line."
okay. 3 degrees to north.
and it is level; the bubble's just about in _he center.
"what's the size of the largest block y'all have passed, ed?"
that we've gone past? oh -
"would you hand me the shovel, please, ed? cidnfidentta"
roger.
"hey, fred, are you ready to read the lpm?"
"fredo. houston, you still with us?"
"affirm, ed."
"okay, can i read the lpm?"
"all right. you can go ahead with the reading, ed."
okay. i'm on - -
"ail right. go ahead, ed."
"- - low scale, 4.9 on x; y, 4.6; z, 6.5; x, 4.9; y, 4.6; z, 7.0; x, 4.9; y, 4.5; z, 7.5. and it's still going up in z. better give you one more set. x is 4.6, y is 4.4, z is 8.0; and it seems steady at that level."
"roger, ed, copied all four sets. and all were taken on low settings, and you can discard the instrument at this point."
okay. it is done.
"and, al, did you say you had taken a sample of the white boulder, or was that too large to sample?"
"no. right now, i'm sampling a layer that is sort of a light gray just under the regolith. that went in bag number 9, and bag number 10 was a sample of some of the stufface rocks that were - that were right around that area. it looks like kind of a secondary impact that had disrupted the surface regolith and gone on down into the gray area. okay."
"roger, al."
you want to - -
"oh, we'll rmnke - make a grab sample here, as well as doc_menting. get one that'll ..."
"okay. and, ed, is the lpm still in your immediate area, then? l"
yes.
okay. they wanted a temperature reading off of it.
"okay, he'll get it for you in a minute."
"here, i'll get it - minute. okay."
"do you want the gnomon? 05 13 37 23 3c okay. and, al, did - did you mention either' seeing a white boulder or a brown - a brownish-gray boulder earlier?"
"i mentioned there's a boulder definitely whitish in color, fred. and we'll be over vhere in a min- ute. not in our immediate vicinity. but it def- initely looks well worthwhile ssmpling."
"ail right, the lpm -"
"that's affirm. they concur here and we'd like you to sample from the white boulder. go ahead, e_."
125 on the lpm.
"roger, copy."
"okay. where is it you're headed for, al?"
"well, - -"
i'll get the bag.
"- - something we ought to do, if we want to drag the met with us, is - see that white boulder down there?"
"yes, i saw it. and there's a - that's a - bu_mer. yes. 05 13 38 2_ cdr we can sample both - both types of boulders right down in that area; so, let's go on down there."
ail right. c(infidentiaw
"and can you give us a feel, houston, about when you'd like us to leave the area?"
okay. estimated time of departure is in about 8 n_nutes - 7 and a half minutes.
okay.
okay. you want: the hammer? i'll grab it.
"okay. ! guess we just run down there this way, huh?"
"yes. okay. i see - one of these boulders, fredo, is broken open. they're really brown boulders on the outside, and the interface that's broken is white, and then another one that most of it is white. they are right in the same area."
yess i believe that's probably a - -
"okay, ed. i assume you're going to sample some of those. 05 13 39 37 _ that's where we're headed right now. it's about 50 yards away."
"why don't you go on down and start, and let me bring the met down."
all right. yes. it's further than it looks.
that's the order of the day.
"okay, fredo. i'm right in the midst of a whole pile of very large boulders here. it's - see what i can do to grab a meaningful sample."
"roger, ed."
"firs_ of all, let met start my photographing. this whole area."
they're all so darn big 5hat there's hardly anything that i can find. let me see if i can chip one.
"okay, fredo -- pag4e-64 gi onfident,ia ilt.. 6"
"okay, ed and al, to get - to get us back on the old time line here, when you depart c here, we'd like to proceed directly to f, weird. and we'll pick back up from that point. en route, you can make grab samples as you see fi_."
"okay. _nld fredo, i've just - -"
"and another note i'll remind you of later on. go ahead, i'm sorry."
i've chipped off one of the white rocks. i put it in bag 13-n. i'll photograph it. there don't seem to be any samples of the white rocks lying around that are small enough for me to sample and be sure that's what i'm looking for.
"roger, ed. 13-n."
"now, just going around picking up hand-size grab samples from the immediate vicinity of where ed is - is operating. i have a couple that are going in bag 16."
"roger, al."
*** help with that one?
that's all right; i can do it.
"there's a football-size rock, houston, coming out of this area, which will not be bagged, it is - appears to be the prevalent rock of the boulders of the area."
that's better.
that can go in one of the z-bags.
"roger, al; we copy."
okay. you got a sample of that white rock?
"yes, i got one batch of particles."
okay. put it right in here. iconfidenti
i dcn't think it'll go.
yes. core tube's out of the way. it'll go.
okay. we'll just try it back that way.
okay'. let's get another one.
"okay, a1 and ed. we have about 1 more minute here at c."
"okay. we're moving on down the hill, now. okay. can you see weird from here? 05 13 45 39 lmi no."
kind of hard to find.
i can't even see triplet from here (laughter).
"okay, let - let's - -"
"wai'_ a minute, al. let me take one quick look at the map before we move. waste a minute looking."
"why don't you take the map, and i'll just head down to the general area of the lm, and you'll probably get enough elevation view from down there so we can see weird."
"oka7. we're leaving c now, houston."
"hey, al?"
yes?
do you see north triplet?
"roger, al. and to rephrase the question earlier, on the way back down, you n_ight integrate any dis- tinction in the lithology on the way back with a better sun angle, and you're free to take grab sam_kles - samples en route to weird."
okay. age -66 iconfid 6
"al, i think that's weird to the north - i mean just to the left of north triplet. and north triplet appears to me to be right behind the lm."
yes.
you agree?
"it's between - it's halfway between those two large boulders and one way down. 05 13 46 57 lmm' yes, i think that's right. uh-huh, that's the one. 05 13 47 o0 cdf: okay. 05 13 47 09 cdf okay. these rocks - these boudders in - in this field here appear to be very weathered, obviously not by atmosphere but - but eroded by some process, because they all show cracks. they show evidences of being broken up either by impact or subsequently. and it looks to me as though these rocks are really pretty old."
"roger, al. and do you have anything left on the 16-millimeter or has it been running on the ret?"
"no, it hasn't. we might turn it on now - follow the progress."
"roger, al."
it running now?
have you checked the setting on it?
guess i better.
...
"and, al, without taking any extra time, if you - -"
come across.
"- - come across any boulders large enough, we might fill the comm check on the way down, if you haven't already done that on the way up.. dlonfident"
"i don't think we're going to find any along our path big enough, fredo. the very largest ones are off to the right - south of us a bit - and up the hill a bit more."
let s go on - did you want anything back there?
no.
"oh, okay."
you want me to hold you back?
"no, that's all right."
watch out. bet you're going to go over here a minute.
i can't catch you. okay.
"and here again, houston, the texture here appears to be - the regolith appears to be a lot of - of pebbles, approximately a quarter of an inch on down to go along with the fines. and the same textured pattern we spoke of before and photographed is also here."
"roger, al."
okay. 'w_y don't we stop here to see if we're really going to weird.
"yes. man, the lm doesn't seem like it's getting much closer."
"is that weird right down there, you think?"
"h_? no, weird is - weird is almost due east of the lm. that's - oh, there it is. look, see - -"
"and, a1 and ed - -"

"okay. we're now out of the boulder field, houston, and proceeding on down to flank."
"roger, al."
"and, i believe - just get a shot - let's get a sample of that baby right there. let's grab some- thing from that one."
ail right.
"he's going to get a quick grab here of a rock, and i'll - i'll photograph it because it's got same tremendous fillets in it."
okay.
don't hit the fillets until i photograph it.
ail right.
"it's not there. why don't you let me get a quick shot there. okay, a quick pan across there. okay. that looks like - yes, we ought i_oget a piece of that baby. jonfidentialm"
"no, :nan;that's hard, hard, hard! look at that melt in it."
"yes. okay, here's a piece of it. ail right?"
come way on back here.
"crystals here; don't lose it. okay, that was about - it's about where we - no, i guess not."
hold it a minute. hold itl let me get a bag.
okay.
this darn bag dispenser is not doing what it's supposed to do.
go _daead and take twc. small.
"houston, the rock we're taking is in 14-n. grab sample from a filleted rock."
"roger, ed. 14-n."
"large filleted rock that - a1 photographed. okay, let's go on. do you want me to pull awhile?"
"no, just watch everything. we don't want anything to drop off."
you want me to hold back awhile and -
"no, no, no. i'd let it - just let it run. we don't want to lose anything."
no. it's holding in very well. *** doesn't turn over. a little higher e.g. now than we had before with that big rock in there.
"fredo, could you give us an idea of about what time we should arrive at weird? how much more time?"
roger. stand by 1
that 16-millimeter's bouncing all over every place.
0_ht to be a good - good - c nfidentt :)ay6
"it's taken photos from every view,"
"okay. i hate to m_ke a grab here that's not from this crater. looks like that cut fairly deep, though."
"yes. let's - hey, here's a whole batch of them right down here, al. let's grab those."
"which way, left or right?"
off to the left and ahead - aro_ad that little crater. they're all from this same area.
houston. unable to see any stratigraphy in any of these craters. the slumping has been such that it's pretty much destroyed - -
i'll grab this one right here.
- - any evidence of stratigraphy.
"roger, al. and i assume, positionwise, you're past flank, now. is that correct? or at least, the d position of flank?"
"no, we're not, fredo. we're - no, we're not at fank - at flank, yet. i'd say we're probably 15 minutes away from weird. did you get it on board?"
"as a matter of fact, i think this is - this is flank right here."
get it on board?
"yes, i've got the rock on board."
"okay, let's press."
"roger. and one other question that's up there is to check for the stratigraphy reported earlier of the light gray-white layer below the top, if you see that exposed anywhere."
"okay. now, we did not see that until we started approaching the edge of the boulder field. the - there's no evidence of that at all that we ncticed. onfident"
":_ot down this far. one thing i did notice - further outside of where we saw the white underneath - but it looked like an impact had either been of the white rock or it was a splatter of white. and it vas just outside where a1 was reporting that the underlying layer was white. as a matter of fact - no, that just - the sun angle was causing it. right now, some of the spray that we're kicking up looks white underneath, but i'm convinced it's just the angle. i looked back the other way, and it - it's not substantiated."
"roger, ed."
hold i-.
that's what i'm trying to do.
"okay, we're moving along pretty well, fred, at this point. and i'd.say we're still probably about l0 minutes away from weird."
"veer good, al. it sounds like you're making a litvle better time going down than up."
"yes, the slope's a different way, fredo. in this case, the met helps."
"okay, don't let me lose that;baby. that's it right there with the three - -"
yes.
 - with the three rocks beyond it.
yes. we're getting down to the place where we won't see it.
"this is probably flank right here, isn't it?"
"i'm not going to say until i get down and look at the exact pattern, it probably is, al. but if this is really flank, we should have been at the top of cone crater where we were."
"yes, i know. c nfidentia: 6 05 14 o0 ok lmp i think we've already passed flank. now, it's stopped. we'll have to wait on it."
"okay. it maybe - looks down here, ed - that maybe what you're looking at there, if you've got another flank-size crater, is the one by e."
"no, this is a big crater. i% - it's 40 - 561meters across. it has a fairly sharp crater in the south edge of it, which is 20 - 30 meters across."
"okay, that looks like it may be the one by e."
"yes, i think that's it, fredo. and it's - ?io, it's at least 50 or 60 feet deep. 05 14 0t 01 cdr why don't we just grab a couple from right here?"
yes. okay.
that baby came apart. very soft.
"yes, it's falling apart as you pick it up. very crumbly, isn't it?"
okay. you got a bag ready?
"yes. 05 14-o1 33 cdr very, very soft rock - remember that crater? - plus another one very close to us with crystal in it. it's flashing. now, going in the bag."
15-n.
okay.
"okay, copied 15-n."
okay to rush?
not quite; let me get it in there.
"stay behind me; we don't want to lose anything, now."
okay. (t nfidentajlm
"okay, that's where we're going, right there."
"yes_.going right for weird. head right for the big boulder. then, weird's right beyond it."
ail right.
easy.
"oka_f, keep going."
this is ed. i_m going back to m_dium cooling.
"roger, ed."
"we - one of the problems of going downhill here is that you have defric - essentially defraction, i guess, around your body; and it creates a halo effect in your shadow; and you just can't see a darn thing, right in front of you."
it's completely either blacked out or washed out right - -
"copy, ed."
"- - immediately - immediately down-sun of you. we're going predominantly down-sun, now."
"okay, fred, we're still moving, and - looks about 3 _linutes away now from weird."
"roger, al."
"the crater we're going by now, we're just to the north of it, fredo, is an old subdued crater."
"if you want to run over behind that boulder over there, i'll tiufto talk to you."
you're the one that has to get behind it and try to talk to houston.
"oh, that's right."
i'll pull the met. go ahead. age tconfidenti
"okay. on second thought, maybe it's not big enough. i'll just - -"
"no, don't think it is."
"no, i guess not. sure is a big old boulder, i'll take a picture of it, anyway."
"okay, and this - this big boulder, al, is - you're just about at weird now. is that right?"
"oh, probably a couple of hundred meters short of weird."
"this country is so rolling and lmdulating, fred, with rises and dips everywhere, that you carlbe going by a fairly good-size crater and not even recognize it."
roger.
"okay, back with you."
"okay, i think this is weird right - to our right here - forward, al. see that fresh one right there? i think that's the fresh one of the weird pattern."
well - -
"okay, a1 and ed; on the weird task, we'd like to pan and grab samples at weird; gad we'll pick up most of our tasks that we had bypassed at e - when we get to triplet."
okay.
"okay, i'll get the pan. i think a itself is right in here, isn't it?"
where are you?
"behind you, to your left. see rj.ght down there?"
"no, i did_l't think so; i think this is it right here. onfiden j"
"no, that's too small, i believe. well, anyway, we're in the area, houston."
"take us a minute to find it. i suppose you prob- ably - well, that's a pretty big one over here."
"okay, al, i think the - the pan will fill us in as to the exact position."
"okay, pan's underway, now."
"okay, pan's complete. did you get a grab sample, ed?"
"roger, al."
"*** grab some right up here, al."
okay.
"and i guess this is going in bag 16. is that right, ed?"
"this is in bag 17, fred. sixteen got used - some time back."
oka_f.
oka_; let's press on.
"it's so darn big, it's hard to fold out."
"we've got a pm_ and a grab sample. what else do we want from here, houston?"
"okay, that's - that's it, al. we'd like to proceed on to the north - -"
whupl
"- - triplet, and - -"
wait a minute.
- -i'll give you - the - tasks when we get there.
"oks_, we'll try to get to north triplet. pag4e- r6 c nfidentia 6"
you ran out from under me just as i was picking it up.
"oh, i'm sorry."
okay.
okay.
"oh, man."
*** some blocks from the - -
"and, a1 and ed, for your stop for the e, we'd like that - take an estimated one-crater diameter short of the crater - north crater,"
you want us to stop one-crater dliameter short. 05 14 10 26 3c that's affirm; because some of the items coming up are the core and the trench.
okay. 05 14 10 31 3c triple core.
"i think we're seeing the rim of the triplet series right ahead of us, aren't we, al?"
"i would say so, yes. if we can say that's the rim of the north right there."
"yes. it's got boulders on it, _,nd%hat's the only thing big enough to have boulders. we're probably about one diameter out, right ncw."
"i'd say we are. right here. 05 14 11 05 _ the way we've been estimating distar,ces today, that rim has to be at least 6 miles from here."
"okay, houston; we're about one dliameter to the east of north triplet."
"to the west of - yes, east of triplet. excuse me."
okay. confideni-
"okay, copied, and the number 1 item is the triple cot8."
okay.
where's the third core tube?
"well, why don't you use clean ones?"
i don't have clean ones.
"yes, you do. they're down in this pocket, right there."
this one? 05 14 1t 39 cdr let me get my camera tightened up.
this one's been used.
"no, no, no. in here, ed."
"oh, okay."
the three tabs should be clean.
ali right.
"okay, we'll pull it back together here."
do you have an 0 to that -
"now, i'm clear to the bottom of that, i think."
"okay; we've got the camera back together. okay, fredo, for your info, the cdr's commander is reading 117."
"poger, al; 117."
"okay, i'll get it."
start with this one. we've only got two fresh ones in here. you've got four out that are used - or _hat look like they're used.
"()kay, the three tabbed ones, we haven't used yet. let me get them, ed. (jidnfide 6"
okay. i'll take the tabbing off of this one.
"yes, i think that's the best way to go. let's mrke - make them 1_ 2, 3 for simplicity's sake."
"i don't have a back from that ,one;where'd it go?"
"the bottom one will be number 11tube with a tab, fredo. got 2 there?"
roger. 05 14 14 04 lmi number 3.
okay. hold on to that one. okay? and the other one will be number 2 with a tab.
and the top one will be number 3 with a tab.
"roger, al. and we're going to subtract off 15 minutes from that *** extension due to plss oxygen."
okay. you still planning on - -
so that gives us about - 05 14 14 55 cdp go ahead.
"okay. that gives us approximately 25 minutes at stop g, here. 05 14 15 11 cd5 twenty-five minutes until what?"
"*** help you. okay, i got this one. go ahead; start your trench, if you like."
"okay. i'11 dig the trench in the far wall of this crater here, ed."
right.
"fredo, i've tried to push in the core tubes - triple core tube - i get maybe a - oh, 3 to 4 inches of pushing in by hand. and it's just surface stuff; very soft - it will not support the weight of the core tube. now, i've got it balanced, and i can take a picture of it, perhaps."
"okay. we're reading you, ed."
okay. we'll try to drive it.
"and do i understand correctly, ed? you're taking care of the triple core on your own there?"
that's affirm. al's digging - busy with his trench.
okay; very good.
"i'll go over and help him photograph it in - a while. and it - it's not going in easy, fred."
"roger, ed."
"i'll try driving it a bit more, but i think i'm on solid rock; and i'm about one core tube down."
"roger, ed. solid rock, about one core tube down."
"yes,"
"okay. the recommendation, ed, is to pull it up and mo,re - over a bit and try it again."
"the way this one feels, it'll be the same thing."
"okay. ed; and when you pull it out, they'd like to save the bottom core and replace it with another one there, when you try - before you try again."
okay.
"hcw's the trench going, al? are you getting - getting down there?"
"i've got a trench here. it's going fairly easily, but i need the extension angle - handle to get it deeper; so, i'll wait until ed's through with that. i_m cutting into the rim of a crater which is ap- proximately - oh, say, 6 meters in diameter, has a depth of about three-quarters of a meter. and we're back in about one diameter away from the north *** triplet. the trench is going through at least three layers that i can see. the fine-grain surface, dark browns; then, a layer of what appears l m age ,-80 l onfident-# 6 to be quite a bit of glass; and then, a third layer of some very light material. and we should be able to sample all three of these."
"fredo, the core tube cap - -"
"roger, al."
- - core tube cap from that sample is in 18-n.
"roger, ed. roger, ed."
"and a very interesting looking rock with really fine-grain crystals in it. it's a grab ss.mple, houston, from that same crater in which i'm digging. it's too large for a bag; it's dark brown except where it's fractured. it's fracture face is very light gray with very small crystals."
"roger, al; and if you can get any with you__ samples down in the trench itself that have any ... rock fragments, you might include those as part cf your sample."
put it in the side bag. put it in that side bag if you can; these are all - i_1t - full back here.
okay.
"let me help you. okay, baby."
"are you about through with the extension handle, or are you going to go -"
"go ahead and take it. i don't really need it to - to drive. 05 14 23 10 cdp, i'll go over and cut that baby_, and we'll - over here. okay, houston; i know that - we did not men- tion this white layer - down in this area before - that was so obvious to us just below the surface up near the flank of cone. but: it appears as though it is - quite a bit - well, itts relatively deep, as far as visual observation is concerned. and certainly not any would be kicked up by foot-prints, or by tracks, or the like. appears to be some of that here in this trench. ttconeiden;'."
"fredo, did you get my - -"
"roger, al."
- - my report that the core tube cap - tip was in 18-_?
"roger, ed. i got that; 18-n. 05 14 24 32 imp okay, and i have taken the bottom core of that one, whioh was core 1 flagged; and it's now by itself - as a single core tube; i'm going to replace that with - number i unflagged, which is one a1 started to l_e earlier but didn't get anywhere with it."
"0k_f. number 1, unpegged, on the bottom."
"you know what's happening in this trench; it's the - surface fines are so loose that they're just falling down, covering the layering that we want to eet. i say, we're not going to get a classic vertical wall here, houston, on this trench."
yes.
"and, ed, are you having any better luck on the triple core this time? 05 14 26 25 imp i've got it in about half a tube. but i'm - getting ready to take a picture of it, so you can locate it; then, we'll go ahead and drive it the rest of the way in."
"roger, ed."
"oks_, fredo. there's three frames here, probably 69_ 70, 71, that are core tubes. the first one's the aborted one that i couldn't - couldn't get in. the second one - the second picture is the - this new attempt, and a 15-foot shot that i raised up and took a locater shot on the horizon on this one. i think it might go."
"ve:_y good, ed."
"okay, i'm getting down low enough; i'm going to have to have an extension handle to finish driving it, i think. age onfidentia4 6"
"okay, i'll give it back to you. i'm really kind of through with this trench."
"roger, al."
yes.
"okay, fred. bag 19 for the s_aple of the surface fine - that is, from the - the surface layer of the trench."
"roger, al. bag 19 is the sample of the surface fines."
"i am unable to take from the walls of the trench the type of material - blocky type of material that i could see while i was digging; so, i'll _ust get a shovelful of that, and we'll mix the surface with the second layer."
"roger, al. how deep did you finally end u_ getting down?"
"well, the trench is about a - - it was covering all the evidence of stratigraphy."
"roger, al."
"and, houston, i'm over 40 feet - 50 feet from where a1 is; and, on the east side of these craters, i have the triple core in about a tube and a _uarter; and it's tightening up again. i just don't think it's going to go the rest of th,=_way. i'm maybe driving it a millimeter a stroke."
"okay, ed."
"i'll hit it a few more licks, _nd we'll see if we can break through or move it a little more. no, that's as far as it is going, houston; one and a quarter."
"okay, ed. we'll just take your judgment on that; when you don't think you're getting it in any further, you can stop there. onfident"
"okay. i think i could probably beat it for the next 10 minutes, fred, and not get another inch out of it."
"well, i don't think you need the exercise; you may as well extract it now. 05 14 31 44 lmi i agree. i'll take a picture of it, a final pic- ture of it, to show you how far we got with it."
"okay, houston; this is al. and bag 21 is kind of a collection of the - the combination of the top two layers. second layer is a thin layer of small glassy-like pebbles. and i was not able to separate that by the trench method; so, i gave it to you mixed up in the - that bag. and the last bag will be pebbles from the bottom layer."
"okay, al. and about what's the thickness of the j intermediave layer there?"
"well, it's really ephemeral - it's (laughs) almost - it's very thin; i would say no more than a quarter of an inch thick, and i just noticed it because of the difference in the grain structure as z was digging the trench."
"roger, al."
"and in bag 20, 2 o, we'll fill a sample of the bot'_om materiad.; also, mixed up with the - some of the surface material that's fallen down in on top of it. and that's about - call it 18 inches below the surface."
"roger, al; and when you and ed can work it in, we need another f2_u check."
okay.
"this is al, at 3.75 and reading - about - - 05 14 34 05 lmi oh, hell."
"reading 35; i have no flags; and i'm in - medium flow now, going to min flow; and feeling good."
"okay, this is ed. i'm 3.75 - - ctdnfidenti,' im 6"
"okay, and what kind of misery are you having now, ed? 05 14 34 2_ lmp 3.75_ 32 percent. minimum - inter_tediate - just a minute - i'm in medium cooling and doing great. 05 14 34 41 lm? now, my problem is i can't get the - - 05 1_ 34 42 cc okay. 05 14 34 43 lm__ - - driving down - driving do_l_tc that rock, i couldn't get the core cap off; i'm going to have to get some help from al, soon as he puts his handful of samples down. okay, that's great."
"okay, let me get rid of this t:rencher."
"okay. on the - on the agenda here, we have remain- ing documented samples, and we need a pan. 05 14 35 19 l_q_ roger. we'll get it for you."
"oh, god. 05 14 35 21 i2__ get another one; skip it; we've got plenty. 05 14 35 32 t_ shit 05 14 35 33 cdf yes. 05 14 35 36 lmf okay, houst - -"
"okay. and, al, one question. did you get the sesc sample out of the bottom of the trench? 05 14 35 k7 cdr well, i told you the trench was kind of a miserable failure, because the walls kept falling down. and i could get a sample from the bottom, but it wouldn't be the bottom, i'm afraid."
"okay, fredo, the bottom - bit on this string was at - what - 23? isn't it, al? that's the one you got."
"twenty-three, right; 23."
"roger, ed. _r' ,clr',,chlti"
"ok_t, we need a pan from here; i can get that."
okay.
okay.
"and, al, when you get done with the pan, i guess we'd still like the sesc sample from the bottom of the trench, even though it probably isn't the bottom."
"we_l, i'll tell you, i'll go back and whack at it a little bit. see what i can do."
"ok_. and, a1 and ed, we have about 8 minutes left here at triplet."
roger. you're still counting on a quick trip out to the alsep antenna?
"that's affirm, al. that's included in this time, and when - when you start out, we'd like you to m_e some grab samples as you pass by north triplet."
okay.
"fredo, the triple core tube, the second core didn't have anything in it. as soon as i opened it up, a little bit fell out; and the second core tube is empty, even though it drove down -"
"roger, ed."
"- - even though it drove in about 3 inches, it didn't get anything."
"okay, ed."
"okay, i'll put a bit back on that one. save it."
"okay, and when you get done there, ed, i guess you can proceed with getting some documented samples b_fore we have to depart."
okay.
"okay. sesc gan - that's over in that pocket, right? 05 14 39 09 lmf yes. 05 14 39 29 lm_ okay. documented samples coming up."
"this white stuff on the rim here, ed?"
beg your pardon?
this white stuff on the rim here?
yes. document some of that. here's a rock right here.
"okay, has a1 moved over by the :rim of north crater, now?"
"oh, no; we're still at the same place."
negative.
"that's pretty well disturbed, al; i'll grab it - i'll grab it without much documentation."
okay.
"we're digging the bottom of the trench for you, fredo."
"okay, al."
"i'm redigging the trench. 05 14 40 38 l_ i'm picking up one of the - so-called whiter rocks, fredo, near the area where a1 is digging. since it's already disturbed, i'm not going to waste time on much documentation. kind of a kicked-up rock."
"roger, ed."
"man, it's going into 25-nancy."
okay. we have about 3 and a half minutes left at triplet.
"okay, we're packing up now."
one more documented sample.
"okay, there is a special request. rather than grab samples at the north crater rim there_ they'd like to get a documented sample of a partially buried rock."
"okay. i was going to try to get you one of those rig_ here, but it looks pretty big. i think maybe i can get it, anyhow."
"okay, ed."
"oh, no! 05 14 43 30 _ what's the matter?"
i can't believe it!
"'what's the matter, al?"
"oh, that - seal came off that thing, and -"
"okay, ed and al, we're going to have to be depart- ing triplet here - and that one brief stop at the north rim to pick up one documented sample - and get on back to the lm area, if we're going to pick up the remaining tasks there."
"okay. okay, you're right."
"fred, this documented sample that i got of the buried rock, it's too big for our regular weigh ba_s. see what i can do with it. the regular sanple bags - i'm sticking one over it, but it'll never close. okay, it's going in it. and will probably stay, but it won't close it. it's bag n_aber - -"
"okay, that'll probably be all right, ed. we're going to have to move out, now."
it's bag 26-n.
"okay, ed."
"okay. i'll grab the gnomon. we're on our way. 05 1_ 46 20 cdr ... the last i see of that son of a bitch. age4-88 confidentia'dii :ay6 05 14 46 29 lmm' they're miserable, aren't they? 05 14 46 36 cdb okay. 05 14 46 40 lmic oh, let me grab it for you."
what? that thing? what? what do you mean - that can?
yes.
forget it. 05 14 46 48 i4mp okay.
"we're never going to use it again. okay, headed for the lm, and we're probably _bout 2 minutes away from the lm, houston."
"roger, al."
"okay, everything's on so far."
"okay, we're -"
we're close ...
here's the - - 05 14 47 46 i2vip triplet right up ahead of us.
could be.
"we'll have to do a little bit to the north to get around it, i think."
yes.
"we're approaching triplet from the - from the - east, north triplet from the east. there's some - a little rock field down here - a small boulder field, al, to get a documented sample from."
okay.
"looks good. yes, looks like they might have come from there. ! confidentia 05 14 h8 26 cdr oops."
)idyou lose something? 05 14 _8 20 cdr you lost you kno_ what.
"oh, no. ;ghat?"
(laughter) this shiny can.
"damn sesc, huh?"
"okay, the shiny can is retrieved. press on. going to have to mush, ed, right down the m/ddle and get a dccumented ssmuple there."
okay.
"man, that pile of rocks - beautiful, right there - right to your left. oh, just the right size. 05 14 49 08 lmp/cdr okay."
don't walk over them._
"no, i'm trying to stay away from them."
there you go.
are these the ones - the ones over here?
yes.
okay.
god damn that zhing.
okay.
gnomon is in place.
"okay, why don't -"
"i'll get the - go ahead, i'm on this side; i'll get the stereo."
"okay. age -90 jonfidentiab.,"
get the locater. 05 14 49 49 cde can't even see the camera settings.
"yes, that's got so much dirt orlthem. okay, 7 foot ..."
"okay, ed and al, as soon as you wrap this one up, we're going to have to press on back to the lm, or we're going to be really tight on the closeout."
okay.
okay.
"all covered with dirt, huh? 05 14 50 30 i_mp yes. god damn, it's bigger than we thought. al, we'll grab-sample that one; i'll get you another one here."
"okay. listen, just put it in that - in that thing. and let's press - because we don't have the time."
all right. i'll grab itg and let me take a picture - an extra picture here.
ail right. i'll grab one right here in the foreground. 05 14 50 50 lmi okay.
"okay, bag 27-nancy. and another documented sample - -"
"roger, al; 27-nancy. 05 14 51 02 i_  - - a larger documented sample than we thought we were getting here, fredo. agail_, it was a buried rock; and it's too big for the sample bag; so, it'll go into the weigh bag."
put it in that one right there. can you get it?
yes. icon fidentia. :j
okay.
it has a very definite shape; i think you'll be able to sort it out.
okay.
"okay, let's mush for the lm."
okay.
"okay, a1 and ed. i guess we can skip the rim of north crater amd proceed right on back to the lm are a."
"that's where we are. we're at the - we're at the rim of north crater, on the west - -"
okay.
- - rim of north crater.
"i think you misunderstood the message. we can prcceed right on by the rim. we have the buried rock samples now, and head on back to the lm."
that's right. that's where we're headed.
that's the antares.
okay_ that's where we're headed. hold it.
i'll get it; keep going. he lost the core tube.
okay. got it?
i'll have it in a minute. i got it.
okay.
everything still hanging on?
yes. everything is still there.
good.
"okay, we're approaching the lm now. coming in to fra mauro base. age iconfident1ab ii 6"
"roger, al, and i guess from here, we'll - we can split up; and ed can take the ._if_tand proceed to the cluster of boulders he had reported earlier to the north of the lm, and you can proceed out to the alsep. 05 14 54 31 cdf/lmp okay. 05 14 5k 33 cdf i'd suggest - well, you can do it vhe way you want to - i guess you can do without, the lm. 05 14 54 39 lmf without the met, yes."
"without the met, because there's nobody ko - if anything falls off, we've lost all those goodies. 05 14 54 28 l_ i think s'!l just take a couple of rock bags - - 05 14 54 49 c_ okay, that's it. 05 14 54 50 imp - - fredo, my tongs and camera, and go."
"okay, al's on the way."
"that's a good point, ed. yes. that'll be fine. 05 14 55 02 i2_p okay. al's on the way out to r_he alsep. 05 14 55 15 lmip as a matter of fact, fredo, i'm just going to take a weigh bag and no sample bag; that way i can get more. the size of these rocks, i - the sample bags are too small, anyhow."
"roger, ed. 05 14 55 33 imp houston- -"
"okay, al, the first thing when you get to the central station - is vo check tlhe alinement an2 verify the alinement and leveling."
"okay, i'm just going to go throagh the same proce- dure as i used during the setup; that is - - 05 il 55 53 cc okay, and i got - i got a change fcr you on vhe azimuth. i confidenti"
"all :right. let me give you a call when i get there, and when i'm alined and level. 05 14 56 33 i_mp okay, fredo, my plan: i'm out in the area of the boulder field; i'm going to photograph many of the boulders, the rocks, the broken ones, the big ones, what have you - and then, grab as many of the different fragments as i can around these piles of broken boulders. i - now that i'm here, i see a large number of inclusions - i can't tell whether they're crystals or not - i think that they are. and i'll grab as many of these - and give you be- fore and after shots as i can - of a whole weigh bag full of rocks."
"okay, ed. that sounds great. 05 l& 57 18 cdr okay. the center alinement on the alsep has changed ve_ little. ought to be a slight change in the bubble level. stand by."
"roger, al."
okay. alined and level. go ahead with your readings.
"0k_, al. the - setting we need is now - actually a change in the azimuth reading to 16, 16.00."
16_00.
"okay, you have 16.00, and you have - -"
"okay, would you verify elevation is still at 6.417"
6.41 is still elevation. stand by - -
"okay, stand by 1, al."
okay.
"okay, al. you can proceed back to the vicinity of the lm; and with the time remaining that you had for the alsep, shoot a few closeup pictures here. we've got about 4 minutes left."
"okay. are the alsep signals satisfactory? age tonfidentia 6 05 14 59 43 cc that's affirmative. 05 14 59 45 cdp_ okay. heading back to the _,'_."
"and, al; houston. 05 15 0l 01 cdf go ahead, houston."
"okay, a little change in the priorities. when you get back to the lm, we'd like the _qfturned to look at the m_sa area, so we can watch the closeout, number 1; and then, you can shoot a quick picture of the solar wind."
"roger; i'm going for the camera, now."
"okay. and we haven't changed tlhe settings, al, so, it's - it should - should be in good shape when you turn her to the mesa."
okay. we'll be setting at 22.
"okay. we need a little more to the right, al."
"yes. i'm just setting it up, f_l?ed."
okay.
"okay, that's f/22. how does that look?"
"well, should - a little more - more to the left. just a minute."
i'm shooting f/22 in peak. how does that look?
"okays if you can tilt it just u:slightly, al, that'll be it. that' s good. you got good azimuth on it, now."
okay. how's that?
"okay, that's great; and you can go shoot the solar wind, now."
it's on the side of a hill; that's a problem out here. confidentiaw
"okay, fredo, i'm heading back from the boulder field. i've sampled two of the larger boulders in the area. rocks broken from them and lying on them; and i've taken a pan. and i have a - maybe a third of a weigh bag full of small rocks from these boulders."
"okay; very good, ed. we need to proceed now with the regular program."
okay.
"what setting would you like on that solar wind shot, fredo?"
staad by.
"okay, al. i'd go ahead and use your - your stand- ard down-sun picture if that's the direction you're shooting it in. they don't have an input here."
ail right.
"okay, the last - just got an input. they want f/ll at 1/25th."
okay. will do.
"and, al; houston."
go ahead.
okay. they'd like for you to return your camera so you don't have to bother removing the magazine from it. you can just put the whole camera in the et3.
roger.
"okay, and, i guess, so you don't get confused, that means we'll be bringing back both cameras."
"yes, understand."
"okay. al's c_mera is in, and m_gazine lima-lima has got a 109. pag e-96 onfidenti 6 05 15 06 18 l_p okay, houston. and i underst_ld now the contami- nated sample under quad 3 is not to be taken?"
"that's affirm, ed. 05 15 06 32 l_ ) okay."
"okay, i'm putting my camera in the etb. let me slide by you there just a minute."
"okay, ed, houston."
go ahead.
"i stand corrected. what they really wantea was to bring al's camera back, instead of yours; so, we'll only be bringing the one camera, the cdr's. 05 15 07 29 i2_' okay, houston. 05 15 07 35 cd_ excuse me just a minute. 05 15 08 01 lm_ right. right. fredo, correct me, now; m_g kilo-kilo has never been used. isn't that correct?"
stand by.
"houston, while you're looking that up, you might recognize what i have in my hand as the handle for the re - contingency sample return; it just so happens to have a genuine six iron on the bottom of it. in my left hand, i have a little white pellet that's familiar to millions of americans. i drop it down. unfortunately, the suit is so stiff, i can't do this with two hands, but i'm going to try a little sandtrap shot here. 05 15 08 51 i_p you got more dirt than ball that time."
got more dirt than ball. here we go again. here we go.
"that looked like a slice to me, al."
straight as a die; one more.
miles and miles and miles. jconfidenti
"ve_x_ good, al. and - to answer ed's question earlier there; kilo-kilo was used for the window shots, ed; so, you ought to bring it back. 05 15 09 41 i_p hey, that's right. we got some of that to start wi'_h, didn't we?"
yes.
okay.
"how many films did we take with this? seven, huh?"
approximately. seventeen; okay.
"okay, ed; houston."
go ahead.
one additional item on the return is to bring back the 100-foot tether. that should also go in the etb.
"okay. okay, there's three cassettes and three f:?amcs. 05 15 11 39 lm? okay. the closeup camera cassette is removed, fred."
"roger, ed."
and stowed. that'll go in there?
"houston, do you read me?"
think that'll clear?
yes. okay.
"loud and clear, al."
"()kay, tell me about this tube, ed. has this got anything in it?"
"no, that's - that's one that's left - nothing in it. before you throw it, get the number. that's the tube that we didn't get anything from. ik_-,_ i1-11,_ i--k i-,r'm age -98 't .uni-lul:r',l day6"

"yes, we'll have some weigh bags. these two."
okay.
okay. can you get them? okay.
"houston. that completes src-1; then we have the - the organic control sample, one sesc container, fo_ core tubes, and one bag of documented samples."
"roger, al."
"okay. now, can you fit -"

"i'll give it a try. wait for me there, just a second ..."
"no, it won't go."

"okay, stu, i'm going through gate 2. and we're braking."
roger.
braking complete.
"we lost your coma, stu; it's breaking up now."

hope you didn't drink any of the coffee while we were gone. sure is going to taste good.
"(laughter) have to worry about that, huh?"
that was a bonus for this flight. corner all the coffee. didn't even make stu unhappy at all.
"okay, i believe i'll just have a few pictures of you here."

"yes. 05 23 16 30 cer okay. we're slowing down, now."
okay. we'll ease it on in a little more.
"houston, antares is stationkeeping at about 100 feet. closing in a little more for the pic- tures of the service module and command module."
"roger, al. we got you on television, and it's looking beautiful. 05 23 17 11 l_ip not nearly as good as the command module locks. 05 23 17 ik cm_r okay, any time you're ready, al., you - t onfiden l"

"yes, i saw that. i was going to wait until we got in a little closer. probably part of the separa- tion plane, i'm sure. okay, i'm going to turn the tv off here before i blast it into the sun on this titcharound, bruce."
"7_ad, stu, we'd like to confirm that you got the i_4weight of 5700 pounds loaded in the dap prior to docking. 05 23 18 13 czc, ()kay."
"okay, i see a smoot?: loop there."
"yhat's - that's no problem, bruce, because i dock _nd i'll go free. and then, i'll get all that squared away, but i - i'll load it in. okay, stand by 1, here."

okay. engine bell looks very clean. ail these streak patterns are radial and uniform. nc hot spots at all. 05 23 20 11 _p looks pretty nice.
"okay, now, you want to put that thing down; let me review the - no, the - the time line instead of the docking procedures again? 05 23 20 33 _ okay."

i can't believe you're docking.

yes. how about that?
where's he at?

yes.

"oh, it's hard to get in there. hell, i can't - let me get out of this son of a 'bitch."
might be able to see whether that's flush enough - before we dock.
you ought to be able to ....
"okay, the central pin looks flush, stu."
"it looks flush, right on out there."
say again?
i'm looking at the end of the probe and the pin looks flush.
"okay, get back in here."
we're standing by for your capture call to go free.
"okay, we capture."
"okay, we're free."
beautiful. normal docking.
stand by for those latches.
there we go.
okay.

let me look at that schedule.

"okay, you haw_ it, houston. we'll have to hold. why don't we bake these things off?"
"ali right, houston. are you going to give me lpand command module weights?"
"ed, this is houston. understand you want the command module weight now?"

"and, kitty hawk; houston. when you're through with what you're doing there, stk, i do have a sep pad for you and a - an updated dap load, but there's no rush on either one."
okay. i'll take the dap load now. that's what i'm working on.
roger. csm is 34727.
okay. 05 23 35 34 cm2p 34727; thank you.

"well, i guess we better get to cracking, troops. i'w_ got to put your 160 pounds of rocks some place."
yes. we can't do it until we get the tunnel open.
roger. i'll be working on that in just a second here. i'll start equalizing.
"yes, it's going to take me awhile to copy these pads, al. so you'll have to press on with that."
"press on with what, ed?"
"i said you're going to have to press on with that, because it'll take me a little while to get these pads squared away."
roger.
"okay, antares. i'm going to be off the - off the air for about 3 minutes here."
"okay, stu."

"okay, ed. if you would, we'd like a few words from you on the subject of the ags. we've lost the ags downlink telemetry and sort of at a loss as to what its current status is. could you spare a little time for that? 05 23 40 08 l_c roger. it performed beautifully up until the time you asked me to check circuit breakers. i looked, and the circuit breakers are okay. i started to look at it for a backup braking gate about that time, and found i could not access it. further- more, the ball, the ags ball, is_still at 150 de- grees pitch, zero yaw, zero roll and has been for some time. and i have no warnings, all the circuit breakers are in, but i cannot access it to get a self test."
"when was the last time you tried to access it, ed?"
"well, just now and - -"
successfully.
"- - oh, about - oh, shortly before we hit the braking gates."
"ed, this is houston. we'd like you to - on panel panel 16, cycle the asa and ae circuit breaker - aea circuit breaker, if you would, please."
"okay. they're cycled. i - in further answer _o that last question, bruce, it was some - somewhere around aos, but i don't remember exactly where."
*** ed. l_nat's close enough.
"good enough. i abandoned the ags and started setting up cameras for the docking about tha_ point. you coming out, al?"
"no, z got the screw out all right, and it looks like that ought - -"
"okay, ed - - -onfiden"
"oh, those springs just hook; i think you can just get rid of them."
"- - and if you didn't see any change, we'd like you to take the ags operate switch - the ags status switch and cycle it from operate to standby and back to op'_zrate;and, if that doesn't do any good, on panel 11, we'd like to close the com- mander's aea circuit breaker. over."
okay. that hasn't done any good. we'll try the other one.
"that doesn't seem to help either, bruce."
okay. which one was that?
any of them. i - have put in the commander's circuit breaker and still have not gotten any- where with it.
"okay. let's skip the ags and leave dt in its present situation, and i've got a few items i'd like to read off for return - over and above the nominal return items."
you've checked coming out of that - thing.
it's not?
"ed, this is houston, i'd like to read you up some extra rec'_rn items, if you've got a piece of paper around. 05 23 43 54 _ okay, i'm ready to copy."

"(cough) we thought about bringing them both back, but since you said not to, we left one on the surface. but you'll have the cdr's."
"man, i can't figure out what the hell's"
"- - 5, we want both of the lmp's eva gloves. cver."
"okay, they're aboard."
"and, of course, we're going to bring back the docking probe. now, on stowage: the first three items, the tethers and the webbing can go in the temporary stowage bags in the com- mand module. the hasselblad in the isa, which is normal, and your gloves can go in the pga bag, and the probe up underneath the right-hand couch in vhe temporary stowage location."
"okay, we've already stowed most of this stuff, bruce. the tether - the 100-foot tether is already in the isa (clears throat ); the lec waste tethers can go in the tsb and so can the 30-foot tiedown webbing. the colmmander's hasselblad, we can put in the isa; the eva gloves are already in the isa."

"we'd like to get the - the tethers, especially the 100-foot tether, out of the isa, because you're going to be bagging the isa in a - a conlsamination bag, and we plan on using the cidnfidentta day 100-foot tether, the lec waste tether, and the 30 feet of tiedown for securing the docking probe for reentry; so we'd like - if you can do it without impact, we'd like you t.oget that stuff out before you put the isa in the contamination bag. ail the other stowage is okay. over."
"okay, we'll see what we can do. did you hear that?"
we've got lots of time to do that cn the way home.
well - -
roger.
"no, but we've got to put it in the decon bag just a little while. if we can rip that lo0-foot tether out right now, why, we'll save ourselves a lot of headache."

cut what?
cut those lights off.
what lights?
the -
utility lights?
"yes,"
"well, hell, i've got dikes for that, al, and i just reach up and take them off like this."
okay. just stick those in the purse.
hers they are.
here's all these goodies.
"kitty hawk, houston. computer is yours."
put them in there.
one of them's still warm.
huh?
that camera's still warm.
"it is? well, hell, it was running just a minute ago."
"okay, al, now that you got those out of the way."
"well, i haven't got them out of the way. i'm going to put them in the isa."
okay.
"now, you want me to get the isa - you want me to get 100-foot tether out of there?"
"yes, you'd better. -66 c fident! 6"
"okay. why don't you hold the purse, and lev me get the isa down, then."
okay.
because we - i'll have to get into it - damn - have to get into it to find out what we're looking for there.
we're - running kind of late.
"well, we can always get it up on the way back."
"well, we got to stow this damn -."
"kitty hawk, houston. were you _alling?"
"well, if you can find it handy, go get it, al. otherwise, don't."
it's not a - it's not a 100-foot tether; it's a 50-foot tether. you talking about the one in that bag?
"yes, they want the one we took out on the lunar surface."
yes. it's 50 feet.
"it's 100 - it's supposed to be. well, there's 50 for you and 50 for me but -"
shit.
"i don't know. i don't feel it in there, anti,ay."
you sure you put it in there and not in the other compartment?
"shoot, i don't know. i thought we stuck it in here. look in the purse; maybe it's in there."
"no. well, we really haven't got time to look for it. we're just going to have to - -"
i don't think so. give me the-- stick the purse in here. fidet i i
huh?
stick the purse in here.
okay.
"i got one more item - a couple of more items, if it'll go."
in the isa?
yes. did you get the ppks and the flag kit out?
"no, hell no. you didn't tell me to."
okay.
got plenty of room in that.
okay.
plenty of room.
okay. ail this stuff -
huh'?
"these, we'll just forget about and stick them back. i don't know what they are."
ail right. those are in.
pardon?
those are all in. what's next?
"ok_f. flag kit, unstow sample bag, left-hand stowage compartment, temporarily stow in aft cabin under netting."
in _ft cabin under netting?
"yes, just hide it out of the way."
you mean the rocks?
"yes. so we cal_put them in decon' bags later, al. c nfidentia'l '"
i think i'll just leave them right where they are.
why now?
"no, no, we don't want to because the goddarn drogue comes in here, gets in the way."
"okay, it's ..."

right on descartes.
"if you leave it up ... descartes again, huh? wait a minute."
no. you go to sleep after that one. confidential
how are you supposed to configure the camera here? okay. your trigger's here and you actually photo- graph it there. and - ... eat and go to sleep. you ...
yes. that's ... while we're waiting.

i just want ts see the ...
"yes ... 03 tl 51 44 cmp a_out 100 hours, we wake up. somewhere in that time frame."

we actually - rest period officially ends at 99:30. the eat period - ... 20 ... 03 11 52 24 _ just a minute.

"yes. we can't talk it over now, because we're going to have get ... 03 ll 55 22 imp okay. everything's off."
"... okay. cmc, free and then auto on the _rb 28. you got the purge line heaters on?"
yes.
"okay, cmc, free - that's auto."
... and i got 15 minutes.
"... 3, verb 4 .. - -"
... myrtle here.
"we still want to do a b/d roll, won't we?"
"yes, might as well."
"· i'm going to load 2110. okay? 03 11 56 11 cml before you - hold it just a second before ycu enter. let me do that one more time, just to make sure we didn't get out of - okay. now enter it. okay. 03 i1 56 24 cdr what did you do that for? 03 11 56 26 cma well, see, we're in a 5-degree dead band."
yes.
"if you change that - if you change that to a narrow dead band, it will immediately fire and bring you over to the center of that 5-degree dead band. what cycling this to free and auto does is - it centers the dead band. ceonfidenti/"
i already did it once before i called up the 43... --
"well, i was noticing the roll - the drift up. see, you're going to a - a half a degree dead band - -"
"... drifted off. 03 11 56 50 cml - - so, anything - more than a half a degree will cause a jet to fire."
"yes, okay. et was off half a degree? 03 i1 56 56 cml well, you knc_, what - what's a half a degree. it was off a little bit."
"the att - it was actually rolling apparently. 03 11 57 04 cml yes, we're - you know, we're - we were drifting in a 5-degree dead band. it's just that i'm real - see, we just had a firing there. yes, after we sat there and talked about it. it's - it's the pro on that 21101. son of a gun. see, we just wasted some gas. we were talking about it."
we were talking ... ?
"yes. but see, if you're moving, you've established it at that point. but then, if you're drifting along - and i should have remembered that, as many tlmes as i've ... watched that. anyway, you enter; sad then when you pro on - on the 21101, what you're doing is, you're shrinking your phase plane now to a half a degree dead band. but you don't change the center."
you change your center by going to free - -
yes.
- - and back to auto.
"see, we had already drifted out, because we got the firing."
"yes. okay. well, we should have - - 03 ll 58 15 cml just before we proed - - pag1e .4 onfidentj"
just before you pr0ed - -
yes.
- - not - not just before you e_ter.
yes.
"you had the right idea, but you did it the _ong way."
yes. kind of.
okay. we're supposed to start the landmark track- ing ... here.
okay.
you can do that now ...
yes.
"plus zero .... if we load it that way? 03 11 58 54 csfp yes, it should. let's try it."
how about that.
"okay, we're cmc: auto."
"do you want to use myrtle, al?"
"yes; just a second, ed."
ready to go?
"yes, i'll - i'll flush the water, ed. i'11 be right down there. 03 11 59 31 .!_,_'v_ okay."
and you can start the hydrogen and oxygen purge at 5 0. that's 10 minutes.
okay.
and the waste water dump. 03 11 59 52 _ okay. get ... going.
"do you want to use myrtle, also?"
"while it's in here, thank you. i don't really need - no, i don't really need - no, i don't need to. it's going to be awhile before i really get a chance to again. no, i talked myself out of it."
okay (laughter).
"you know, it wouldn't hurt us to get that waste water dump started."
ye_.... do it in a minute. 03 12 00 15 cml ...
"yes. i think ... be sure it's all out of the way, so it doesn't screw u_ your - 03 12 o0 20 cml did you turn _he heaters on any earlier, or did you turn them on right at 30? 03 12 o0 2_ lmp what, the hydrogen? 03 12 00 26 cml no - yes."
no - -
turned them on 3 minutes early.
okay. so we'll wait on that. but -
"this damn thiag is ... 03 12 02 05 cml isn't that something? we - we got so shocked by looking up and seeing the moon in the window, we didn't do a verb 82 (laughter). 03 12 02 14 i_ ... have any doubts?"

okay. you want dump a?
let me have it.
"okay. ready, go. cross off a."
and there's sunup.
when is aos this rev? did they give us a map - - 03 12 03 46 i2zp they didn't. they - -
i guess they ran out of time.

"they gave us a map update, but %hey only gave it to us on the 180 degrees."
we could extrapolate from the ... - -
"oh, well - yes, the - at least as my - far as my solo book goes, the aos/los was in a minute of - shown in the - on my solo book."
...
"ail they do is read me the 180 time. so that's probably what they were doing here. in fact, i may have said that. if anybody would say that i said that, i would agree with them .... not any- where around the points of the moon, are they?"
no ... can say what way we're pointing.
"we'll be up in the air, because the optics will be pointed down. tconfidenti i. 03 12 04 _1 lmp yes."

08_:_4:53.
okay.
al's starting the clock over here.
"one minute late. yes, okay .... 2 minutes."
... okay.
"well, i just missed it - i'll get it at three."
"okay. h2 purge heaters have been on 20 minutes. we'll have to start the oxygen purge and then a ihydrogen purge. 03 12 07 29 _ okay. 03 12 07 30 _ mark. mark, mark, mark."
"3oy, i'm sure glad we cut out that tv show."
yes.
"it really worried me, when i saw where it was. glad we got sort of a pseudoexcuse - to cut it out."
"yes, there it is."
this is really something. the most unreal looking :real thing i've ever seen. if that makes any sense (laughter). ll8 confidential 03 12 10 53 _ probably not.
"... yes, it is ... vegetation. something as common reference, you know - familiar reference. so you don't know how far above you are. so it makes it look like the scale is ... 03 12 11 16 _ okay. let's terminate waste water dump. 03 12 11 19 cm2m okay."

there's our loveletts again. little lovelett. that's oriented like that. ()kay.... that is chaplygin ....
which one's chaplygin? 03 12 17 13 cml it's off my side.
are we headed for mendeleev?
that should be over on your right.
that's what i _hought.
yes. there it is. the tracks are across the mid- dle of it.
those are definitely secondaries in the center of mendeleev.
i'm - that's not the current thinking.
isn't it?
no.
that's a crater chain.
_rater chain. right. davy and - confidentiatf
"yes, you can sure get fooled easily, but it sure looks like a -batch of secondaries."
"... crater chain hadn't ever seen it. it ices make a difference, doesn't it?"
i'm not about to argue with them at this pcint.
"what am i supposed to be doing? 84:58. i'm not doing anything, just checking my camera. ckay."
and null bias check.
they didn't want me to do that .... the backside.
huh?
you should have done that in the dark.
...
"hey, my - my ... 03 12 21 10 l_p are we supposed to be doing any photography at all on this .. ·,"
"i have got the crater king out here, stu, if you were looking for it."
"yes, that's one of our targets. that's one of farouk's favorite craters. 03 12 22 25 i_p pretty damn interesting one, too. 03 12 22 39 i2_p really an interesting one. huh? that one ... looks like ... got a rugged one right out here - with the central peaks."
"... 03 12 23 05 i_l sure does. really got a very complex central structure. 03 12 23 08 cr_ it's got one of the biggest central peaks a_ound. it's a very unusual crater. but there are some dark areas in it that farouk has gone on record as saying they are dikes. confidentia 03 12 23 37 cml high sun. that's one right down there; just shows how it dominates the whole photograph. just an extremely bright crater. sun angle just isn't high enough for you to see it here .... yes, ti_ey're mining it ?, i think."
what's the name of that one?
it has no name. i've called it the bright one. this is langemak that we're just going over right down here.
"it's got to be fairly fresh, too. 03 12 2h 42 cmp yes. it's a very bright crater."
"hello, houston; il. loud and clear."
okay. give me a second. time skip
"hey, al."
yes?
"the lineations down here cross the - no, i don't have a big enough chart to cover all this. but they just point right up toward imbrium. this transition between -"
okay. thank you.
"man, we ... - -"
just need a wider chart is all.
"fantastic. a wild view out here with the ... like that, pointing it ... well. 03 13 07 37 _ damn it, copernicus ought to be coming into view. 03 13 09 29 _ ... ooh."

okay. 27.8 by 27.1; it passes.

okay. your being in pad burn attitude for the - is causing the comm problem. i'm sure it is. it's barely hanging on to enough signal strength %0 talk.
"well, i still can't make that look like rigel. there's a lot of light out there. 03 13 48 43 cm2_ i saw orion awhile ago, but - - 03 13 h8 45 cdr yes, but so did i - but it sure doesn't look like it now."

and you agree to 206.4 as the total delta-v?
yes.

"probably came from the lm. a lot of those little ba'_ies floating around; we brought them back, and they probably just floated out of our pockets."

20.8.
"okay, what's your confidence on getting a hack on ex_ct burn time now that you have looked at three of them, ed?"
it's within 2/loths..
"okay, great. are you going to count down to zero ... 20.8? you have to shut it down on zero."
"we're going to wait until he calls zero, and then move the switches."
okay.
i'll not try vo have them off at the time he says zero.

"houston, 14. how do you read? ..."
"well, how're the troops of antares making out? do you have an estimate on the landing spot ret,ron? confidential pag1e89"
how far from the spot? did they - they come right in on the first pick?
roger. are they right on the target?
"oh,_okay."
"houston, 14 - kitty hawk."
"hey, ron, got any word on how the low-altitude pass on 14-1 and the high-altitude compare?"
okay.
okay.
"ali right, ron. i tried to change the cs_mera and put the sextant on and take a look at vhe site."
"and, houston; kitty hawk."
"hey, ron. has - is scmebody thinking up an - any words about our descartes photography? does it look like the hycon's wiped out; are we going to do the coas or - any decision on that?"
okay.
and - somebody ...? does it look like the hycon's wi_ed out?
"left, left, and ..."
that son of a hitch ....
"okay, we're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on target 1. i'm now running - det was started at - t-start at 111:59:43 and i'm wa_ting to try again."
first target at 8:07.
... 5.
"okay, starting at 9:05."
"... yet, if not ... - pag1e90 confident l"
"and approaching 4 minutes. 04 15 25 02 cml okay, there are n_ytargets. targets a, b, c."
"okay, standing by to start the time. that's 5 minutes."
"mark. intervalometer going. okay s i have tar- gets a, b, and c. c will be the firs_ intc the zero-phase. picked them up withcut any difficulty at all .... anyway. intervalometer ... again. 04 15 26 14 cm2_ an_ a, b - okay, looks like c is just abcu_ in zero-phase now. and i really have losz c az zero- phase. that's a pretty good picture there. as it moved into zero-phase, it was essentially wipe_ out."
"now it's coming back out again. 04 15 26 h6 c'_pe okays b. you just almost lose b going tc zero- phase. i can tell where it is by the o_her craters - pointing at it. but, if you didn't have that help, it'd be tough. 04 15 27 12 cmip and now we're going into - a's goin_ in toward zero-yhase. in fact, i'm quite surprisea how washed out they do become. i had anticipaae_ i would be able to stay with them a little more than that."
"well, we're going - it's 7 minutes, so a will _e moving towards zero-phase. amd it's pretty much the same story. zero-phase is that - is thav con- dition - it - it really - kind of surprisinf how it - how it wipes it out. i think you can tell the general area, on b in particular, that with zhe lead-in, you could - you could find it. with - with b, it's pretty much totally wiped ouz a_ - at zero-phase, and a had a little better l_nj_narks around it."
"okay, i'm switching to second target now. am_ a shows up extremely well. b is - you c_n see b here now. it's just starting to go into - int_ zero- phase as it moves on up. but b is a - b's a mighty rough target, even without zero-phase. confideni'ial c it: _! age191"
"and you can - you can hang onto a pretty well. b - b, just - i just didn't find long enough to give a good - a good impression on that one - on that one. i guess, overall, i'd rate it - at -"
"but a in - in target 2, you can almost hang onto - b in target 1 -"
"now, of course, target 2-b is hard to find even under good conditions, so - but it'd be impossible at the - at the zero-phase point. and i'm going to quit now, and i'll give you a little summary here. i'll rate these as i - by the criteria that we set up. 0kay, on target 1, i'd rate c -"
"okay, i'm going to turn off the intervalometer. no. let it r'_n for another 20 seconds. but i - i'm so far out, i - i really can't - it says you got to let the dac run until 12:2_. okay. ail right, i'd raise - i'd rate c in area 1 - i'd rate c as low, b as medium, and a is - is low; 2-a, medium; and b, very low."
"i think what would really help you is - is relief around, like c was out pretty flat. and then, when it got zero-phase, it pretty well wiped it out. but - okay, and on my mark, the dac will be going off. stand by."
mark. i let it slip one.
"mark. there, that was the last picture on tar- gets 1 and 2."
"and just a little more on the debriefing. i think if there's some relief around, it helps you quite a bit. like c was out flat, and you'd lose it. b, i had the good chain of craters going into it, so you could pick that up, and - and a, also. it was the landmarks that really - really had you pick it up. but when it's out flat, it just washed it out completely."
"okay. houston, kitty hawk."
"344.7, 340.9, ... _k.lrlr_l_klti a i age confidentt4#. 04 15 3_ 17 cmp hello, houston. this is kitty hawk."
kitty hawk. how do you read?

okay.
"okay, thank you. 04 16 00 36 cm_' okay, i'll do that. 04 16 00 56 cmf and stand by. 04 16 00 59 cm_ mark. camera's running. five minutes. okay, _d now i can pick up to ptolemaeu$, to ptolemaeus a, and i can pick up bright crater. yes, even at this low elevation, targets a and b show up real well. the trouble of it is, it doesn't look to me like the camera's on target, but - they're a little too far to the left. but, anyway, i c_n't see targets - both targets a and b by themselves. i guess i used that little bright crater up by b, maybe as a gou_e_ but it showed up pretty well. there's no problem on acquisition, houston. appear to just be gettin_ better as i - as i come up in elevavion. of course, i guess it wouldn't surprise me to come up ere and see that i picked up the wrong target. con fidenti.- t"
"i really don't think this camera's pointed right, ron. it's boresightea right down - looks like the junction between ptolemaeus and alphonsus. but, anyway, my - both targets a and b - had no trouble acquiring these and no trouble sticking with them. even a is the - the hardest; it's not quite as straight. now b had a - had a bright rim and showed up at the very start of the - of the obser- vation. a is - is a little more subdued, but it was quite easy to pick up and hang on to. and that's - that's really a no-sweat on - on this one, much - much easier than the - those on the back- side. in fact, i rated some of those with zero. and i'd have to give them up on - on both these targets - cone crater."
"and the hard part is over, once you acquire them at that low elevation. in fact, the elevation is as difficult as - any sort of sun problem. that wculd be here, as we go - go towards the zero- phase; i guess it's probably still about 08:h0 and i'd guess about 40 minutes to go. it's still hanging in there right now. no - no problem at all. particularly b, it's - it hasn't the - the bright surface on the center across the crater - tkat makes it that much easier. let's see, i can see the zero-phase. and i guess the camera was pointing at it as we get up here closer. and i es_ see zero-phase now, approaching target a, so tkis should be a - a good test. been no problem to acquire up to now. 04 16 04 39 cml_ there's zero-phase just about on a, and the camera took the picture. okay, we went through zero- pkase on a with - with no problem - hanging on to tile landmark itself."
"zero-phase is passing b - at this time. and it, again, is definitely no problem."
"and now, as we come cut of the - out of the zero- phase, it gets constantly better, of course. and i'll be switching targets at 09:58. it's 09:24 now. both targets at ptolemaeus are ready to pick up. of course, it's no problem now picking those ut_. _ jl_ ip_l!% !_l.l?.! ,l i '_ 04 16 05 59 c_) okay, we're going to switch now and take a loek at - at parry. and - actually, this one here is again extremely easy. you can pick up both - both targets a and b as soon as you see it_ nc sweat. i think you'd use the - of course, you'd use the - parry and parry m to guide you i:tc_the area. but once you got into the area, why_ a and b just stand out so good that, here again, i:'s - primarily - it's - the elevation angle helys, because we're up a little higher and - and, also, the bright crater stages show :_ extremely well. it's like you got the crater with a bright rim. it real:_ helps with low elevation."
"in fact, zero-phase is approaching - approaching the area now. and both targets are - are hangin_ in there. 0_ 16 07 22 c_ camera went just right at zero-phase. _nd here again, it was extremely easy to recognize the targets - this would be - really, again, a no- sweat proposition to pick the targets up. zero- phase - really doesn't have that big an effect on - on these two targets."
"okay. and now, i'll stop and rate them here; seems like a good time. i guess target a was ex:_remely good all the way along. target b, also, was _uite easy to recognize. but here again, prim - primarily because of the - of the sun shining on the - on the crater rim. an older, more diffuse crater would be more difficult to pick up, but with those - with those bright - bright rims - bright si_e :o - both targets a and b, it was really no problem. okay. and my last picture, i will give you a mark. when it goes off, it'll be a little past 12:32. 04 16 09 21 c_ and - 0k 16 09 22 cmp mark. last picture on target 4. camera is off. 04 16 11 11 c_ okay. i'll get to moving here, and then i'll pick me up at - oh, maybe between 50 mhd 58. first frame number should be eight. - onfidential"
"okay. just a couple of more comments while they're fresh in my mind. i think there was a big differ- ence between the frontside and the backside passes, and that's primarily because, on the - on the front side, we're picking out craters that were out in a flat area. and they had the rim up behind them to - to guide you in on it. i think you'd - you'd use the - the large, gross features to get you pointed in the right area of the - of the mare or the flat surface, and - and then_ the - the rim of thc crater would - would - would show up. and you could guide in on it. both those craters at parry were quite fresh; they had a bright rim. the tar- get a in the ptolemaeus was fairly subdued - but still, yet, it did show up, and you could hold on to it right through zero-phase. so, let me see, i'd rate -"
i'd rate both - both targets 3 and 4 - high.
"a-3, c-4, b-3. a-3. c-4 - okay, ron. a-3, c-4, b-3, d-4."

"sure is a lot of difference with this low sun than '_here was yesterday. kind of amazing about c; low- in particular, how it - you really lose it _ zero-phase,"
"well, tell you what. at this low - sun angle, you can see a b on target 2, but it's still - still almost unidentifiable; that's just really a tough target. a shows up real well at this low sun angle. you'd be hard put to call which crater was b - at any sun angle. 05 19 06 02 cml okay. at 04:20, turning on the dac here shortly. camera ..."
"and i lost them all - so on that one, at the switch point, i could not pick up target a at all. et was just too subdued. b was easy to pick up, and c also. c - c was - was very easy to pick up. going through zero-phase, b was completely wiped out; a, i never did have to start with, so it was wiped out; and c - c held through zero-phase and reason- ably well; but as it got further on up, it, too, got pretty well wiped out. i think it's the same bit of being on the - being on the backside. you just - the terrain is - you don't have the flat mare surface to give you the relief that - that you need to pick out - to pick out the targets. it's - what - very little contrast in albedo, and - you - you just don't have the - the ability _o see the darks and lights like we did on the frontside pass yesterday. and, i guess, in summary now, for targets 3 - very easy to pick up at the time i picked them up; of course, the sun was low an them. and i'm going to turn off this ... test lever under panel 18. okay, i'll leave it on a little longer and debrief onto the tape. a - a, b, _nd ccn target 3 picked up very easily. saw them into zero-phase; surpri - b is a fairly shallow crater, but it even held up as good as c. i'd out b _u_ c both completely wiped out at zero-phase. a held to zero-phase; but then, as it went on up, you surely couldn't have picked it up - by itself, if you didn't know the relation to some other terrain. all three of those were - once you're well past zero-phase, it'd be a rather marginal target. and, on target 6, i never got a at all - it was already wiped out. b went real fast in zero-phase approach. c, you could still identify after zero-phase, but just because you knew it was there, knd then, i% got pretty well wiped out as it - as it went or:up."
"and i'm turning off the camera. it just maie i_s last mark, i'll let it hit one more, let iu cycle one more time."

"and you are go for tli. huntsville reports that you have a 6-second propellant pad which is 3 seconds more than a 3-sigma case; so you're good on consumables. the iu is so good that we're not going to update it. the only change we have for you is in the tli checklist. at 57 minutes where you slew the fdai to 18 degrees, we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees at ignition. the s-ivb is riding on the top of its deadband."
"- - understand; and just out of curiosity, was that engine out to use up more s-ivb fuel?"
"the engine out did cause you to use more s-ivb fuel - about a 10-second-longer burn; but you're still go. o() oi 49 2 cdr okay. thank you. ()()()l 49 2 cc ;jtd, 13, louston. we'r_ ready to support pyu_ arm and docking probe extension whenever you' i:'e ready."
"okay, houston. docking probe has been extended and all indications are nominal. we're down to pyro arm now and we're getting ready."
"okay, jim."
"okay, houston. my circuit breaker's armed - or closed; sequential logic, two, on and up and we're ..."
"okay, 13. you are go for pyro arm. canary (rev 2)"
"and, houston, 13. were you reading us?"
"roger, 13. go ahead."
"roger. we have our sequential arm circuit breakers in and our sequential logic, two, on and up and we are just standing by for your confirmation for a go."
"sorry, 13. you didn't copy. you are go for pyro arm. over."
0kay; fine. thank you.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead_ houston.
"about 2-1/2 minutes to los, jim_ and your a0s at carnarvon will be 2 plus 25 plus 50. over."
roger. aos at carnarvon 2 plus 25 plus 50-
that's affirm.
"apollo 13, houston. los in about 1 minute. at los we would like command reset and then normal."
roger. pag_ ih carn vo (r v 2)
"apollo 13, houston through carnarvon."
"okay, joe. read you loud and clear. we are sitting here monitoring time base 6.... count- down; we're 20 seconds away."
"okay. we're just starting to get data, and everything still looks good to us."
"tey,joe. at 2 hours and 12 minutes, the 02 flow high light came on, and it's been pegged high ever since, so itts been on about 114minutes now."
"roger, 13. we're looking at it."
time base 6.
copy. time base 6.
"okay. apollo 13, houston. you have a go for all systems, and the 02 flow high check is nominal with the waste tank vent open at this time, and it's no sweat."
okay. just wanted you all to check it for me.
okay. we did.
thank you.
"apollo 13, houston. we will be losing data from carnasvon in about 1 minute. we'll probably have voice through aria. everything is honkey-dory, and we will be listening for you to tell us how the burn goes."
"okay, this is 13. we are standing by, too."
"apollo 13, houston through aria. just a comm check. over."
reading you clear ...
"okay, jim. it's not the best, but we are reading you."
roger.
"ignition, houston."
"copy that, jim. good deal."
everything's okay so far.
houston; roger.
... at 38.
we're getting a little vibration during this burn.
houston; roger.
it's off. engine off.
"houston. copy. engine off. note after the hawaii pass following tli, there is continuoas acquisition among goldstone (gds), madrid (mad), and honeysuckle (hsk)."
"13, houston. we'll have you through hawaii in 3 minutes."
roger. through hawaii in 3 minutes.
"apollo 13, houston through hawaii. over."
13 through hawaii. how do you read?
"13, houston. you're weak but clear; it will probably get better in a second. we're standing by for the burn report."
roger.
"13, houston. the booster reports that everything looks good with the s-iv."
"sounds good, houston. the ride was very nominal. we a little vibration, though, during most of the rlln."
"okay. we copied your call on that, jim. 00 02 46 19 lnp okay, joe. _i_edsky read 35560, plus 04445, plus 01769, and delta-v c was minus 3.0."
roger. you can't ask for much better than that. how about the burn time? did you notice?
"okay. on my trusty watch, i had about 3-3/4 seconds long."
okay. copy that.
"apollo 13, houston."
"roger, houston; 13 here."
"okay. we have the s-ivb maneuver to sep attitude commencing at 2 plus 56 plus 37. duration of the maneuver: 4 minutes. sep time, 3 plus 06 plus 37. over."
"okay. if i heard those right, joe, the s-ivb maneuver was 2 plus 56 plus 57. sep time is 3 plus 06 plus 27."
"correction on the second; 2 plus 56 plus 37, and 3 plus 06 plus 37."
"okay. 2 plus 56 plus 37, with the maneuver time and the sep time, 3 plus 06 plus 27?"
"that's plus 37, too. exactly 10 minutes later, fred."
okay; 37.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"we see the booster doing all the right things, and fido says your trajectory looks good, and it looks like we'll stick with a pretty close to nominal midcourse, too. we'll have soma numbers for you later"
okay. and we concur. the s-ivb is maneuvering at this time. 00 02 58 3 cc roger.
"and, apollo 13, houston. wetd like om_n1alfa. over."
"13, houston. now request omni charlie. 00 02 59 5_ cdr roger. omi_icharlie."
"and, 13, we'll be doing a handover, now."
okay.
apollo 13_ houston. you are go for t&d.
"okay, joe. thank you."
"and, 13, itouston. check your noun 17 for extraction pitch attitude. it should be 319 degrees. over."
okay. we'll look at it. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription tape 3/!
"okay, houston; 13. do we have a go for pyro arm?"
"13, houston. affirmative. you're go for pyro arm, and recommend you secure the cabin pressurization."
"we did. we closed the waste management vent valve, there. or waste stowage valves - -"
"okay. we're reading 6 psi on the cabin, jack."
"roger, joe. thank you very much."
"yes, that's quite a bang, joe. we've separated, and we've pitched around about 60 degrees now."
"roger, jack. we see you pitching."
okay. we got the sla panels - one of them is out front now.
"ah, so. 00 03 08 38 cml got the s-ivb. i guess we're about 80 feet."
good deal.
"okay. i'm going to come on with the tv now, joe."
"okay, fred. we're waiting for it."
"13, houston. we've got a groovy tv picture."
sounds good.
"is the focus good enough, joe, that you can see all the glittering debris?"
"we've seen some debris, fred. the booster itself is a little bit bright. what's your f-stop?"
okay. i'm at 22.
why don't you go up a click and let us have a look at that.
okay. you're at 44 now.
okay. let's stay there for now and i assume you're in peak.
affirmed.
"13, houston. recommend rate 2 on the bmagn."
thank you.
it's getting bigger.
"as you might know, joe, i've got the center seat, again and i can't see a thing."
too bad.
i gave him the tv monitor.
"okay, i'm going to be moving the tv directly. i'm going to pull it out of this bracket, jim."
"13, houston. did you call?"
roger. i'm going to be moving the tv to get a better shot here - moving it out of this bracket.
"okay, fred. it's just beginning to cut off at the bottom, but it's still a very good picture."
"that's a good picture, fred."
"yes, we are just about there. about 10 more feet no_."
roger.
"everything looks pretty good down in the s-ivb, too. the shroud still looks intact down there."
good deal. there is really quite a bit of detail on this picture.
okay. we've got two - two barber poles.
"houston; roger. 00 03 18 10 _ okay. you should be able to see down into the portion of the iu right now, joe."
"fred, houston. we'd like to try going to average on the tv for a minute or so."
"okay. you've got average, and a little yellow dust cap just floated by in front of us."
yes. we see it at the top of the screen.
"fred, after a few minutes of this, at your con- venience, we could use some interior shots if you get the time and if the lighting is good. 00 03 18 51 _ okay."
"and, 13, houston. the s-ivb vent times are nomi- nal as in the flight plan within a few seconds."
"we're hard docked, houston."
"roger. understand. good deal. fred, one more thing on the tv. if you could come to f:22 again - -"
okay. you've got f:22 again.
"and, houston, fred will handle the camera as we go through the postdocking checklist."
"okay, jim. real good."
"okay, joe. i am pointing it over toward jack, and it's pretty bright with the earth out that window. is that sort of washing out the picture here?"
"no, fred, it's not. we've got a bright spot where the window is. the rest of you are semi- silhouetted. it's a pretty impressive picture."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
for fred. the ios ? has caught you with the fuel cell reactant values in latch again.
touch_.
and we have word that the propellant usage for t&d was nominal.
"okay, what is nominal, please?"
"well, i didn't ask that yet, jack; stand by one."
okay (laughter).
"fred, this is houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay. with the direct sunlight from the window, out of the tv camera field as it is now, we'd like you to open it up an f-stop or so and, if convenient, try to keep that bright spot out of the window."
okay.
"13, houston. i guess we could stand one more twick down on the f-stop."
"okay, joe. he's going to do it."
"that is, we want you to open it up. looks like a very interesting book you're reading."
i have two of them.
"hey, that's pretty, fred."
okay. i hope you got more detail than i have on the monitor here.
"no. we probably don't, but it's kind of a neat picture anyway."
"houston, we are now going to finish repressurizing the tunnel."
houston; roger.
"... probably hear, joe, we're just finishing pumping up aquarius here."
"okay. about all we see on this picture, fred, are the bright spots with the lights around the tunnel area. the hatch itself is pretty dark."
"13, houston. by the way, we'd like to know how the high gain antenna lockup worked. our signal strength is a little bit lower than we thought it would be."
"it looked just the way i expected it to, joe. i had her sitting there in reacq with the numbers cranked in and soon as we got pretty much through the rotation, i just threw it down to high gain and it appeared to lock right up."
"okay. good deal. see that flashlight beam wandering around in there. 00 03 33 45 iap houston, 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
we'd kind of lik_ to hold off on th_ - st_rl th_ venting again until we get the things - pumped back up inside here. wonder if you might give us a call to remind us when to initiate that.
"okay, 13; will do."
and we'll try to shift her up to look up into the tunnel here.
okay. real good.
"okay, 13; houston. i think we could use an f-stop lower. what f-stop are you in now?"
"i'm about as iow as you can go, joe. i'm sitting on 4.4."
okay.
"what you're looking at, joe, is the commander has removed the hatch and is proceeding to stow it."
"okay, 13. that's a pretty good picture there."
the cdr is verifying the docking latches now.
roger.
"hey, joe. jim reports that there's a slight, you know, burn smell up in the tunnel area, as been reported on previous flights."
okay. we copy that.
okay. the commander reports all docking latches latched.
houston; roger.
"13, houston. for your information, the s-ivb vent is proceeding on schedule. 'pape 3/6 t'av_ ;.'_ (j() ('_ il? 15 (;mi' okay, joe. o0 03 42 20 _p yes, joe. that':; - ?hat':: coneurrin6f wit_ all the thousands of particles that i see going by outside here."
yes. i guess i didn't need to tell you.
"13, it looks like jim is connecting the _mnbilical at this time. is that right? 00 03 4h 21 lmp yes, that's affirm - affirm, joe. do you have any detail up in there at all? on tilemonitor it looks like i can - i can make out tile drogue - the drogue a little bit, but not much else."
"we can see the probe pretty well, and we carlsee his hands quite well there."
"okay. we're powering the lm now, joe."
"okay, roger that."
"and the voltage looks good there, 13."
roger.
"okay. we're going to take an outside view now, out the left side, joe."
"okay, fred. real good."
"okay. you making out the picture there, joe?"
yes. is that the world?
"okay, fred. that's pretty nice looking picture. we'd like to know what settings you used to get that."
"okay. i think jim is holding it now and - it - okay, it should be in about f:22, infinity, and i think the 50-millimeter. and jim says he thinks he hit baja in the picture now."
okay. i think we can stand to go to f:44 on that. the clouds are pretty bright.
"okay. we are going to have to press on here, joe, so we are back inside. tap_ _/' 00 i)3 49 o0 cc okay. thanks a lot."
"okay. iiow's that picture looking back oun:id_' now, joe? getting ready for lm extraction."
"okay. that looks pretty good, fred."
"houston, this is 13. do we have a go for'pyro arm?"
"13, houston. affirmative. you're go for pyro arm."
"hey, joe, when we went back up and rechecked the tunnel there, we found two latches that weren't cocked and we reset them."
"i'll roger that, jack. 00 03 56 56 cml joe, i've got a beautiful view of the earth out window 1."
"roger, jack. 00 03 57 0_ lmp by the way, the windows came through in real good shape. window 5 looks real clean, so i am kind of hopeful that hycon stuff will be pretty good."
good deal.
"i meant window 3, joe."
"()kay, 13; houston. you're go for lm sep whenever you' re ready."
roger.
"okay, 13; houston. correction on that. you're go for lm sep at the nominal time and - or later. we don't want it early."
"okay, joe. we'll do it at 04:01:00."
roger.
"okay. we're about ready to pull the lm out, joe."
"okay, 13. 00 04 01 03 c_p here she comes."
"okay. looks like we're clear, joe."
okay. looks good. it's weird because we get the tv about 10 seconds after you call it.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. we'll be waiting for you to tell us that you feel you're safely clear of the booster, and give us the go to command the booster in its yaw maneuver."
"13, houston. did you copy my last about giving us a go for the yaw?"
"yes, we're maneuvering, joe, and we hadn't picked her back up again yet."
okay. do you want to wait till you acquire it before we yaw it?
"how much time do you have, houston? can you wait, or do you want to do it right now?"
"ne can wait if you want us to, jim."
why don't you wait just a little bit.
)kay.
"joe, did they ever get an idea of what that - the td and e fuel was?"
"jack, they're not willing to pin it down to a specific number right now because they say the tanks will warm up later on and the apparent consumption will go down. but it was nominsl."
",)kay."
"okay, houston. we have the s-ivb in sight. you are go to maneuver the s-ivb."
"_ouston, roger that."
"try to give you a - houston, we're going to try to give you a shot of the s-ivb with the tv out window number 3."
"okay. real good, jack. our s-band signal strength has been fluctuating. does it seem to be going all right up there in the auto track mode ?"
"yes. right now; yes, it's dropped off to about the 70-percent point, joe, and it was before up about 85."
okay.
"and, houston, do you have a tv picture?"
"not at the moment, jim. we had a garbled one there for a few seconds, and we don't have one at this moment."
okay. i can see the s-ivb now out the hatch window and it's - -
"okay, jim. suddenly we have a very good picture."
okay.
"and, houston, i can see the gold shroud around the iu, and it looks that it's all intact."
"roger, jim. we copy that. incidentally, the aps evasive maneuver will be about 4 minutes late. it'll be at about 04 plus 18."
roger.
"13, houston. wonder if you could zoom in on that s-ivb for us a little bit?"
okay.
"yes, yes. more like that. that's nice. it's off our screen to the right, now."
"oh, that's very nice, very nice. o0 04 13 55 cml okay, joe. is eecomm monitoring the 02 flow high light again? we haven't yet started the venting yet."
okay. stand by. i'll check.
"13, houston."
go ahead.
"jack, your cabin regs are still making up, but you're go to open the waste management vent again at this time, and we'll delta the time to close it by the appropriate amount for you."
"okay. real fine. well, we'll wait till the s-ivb does its maneuver here."
"okay. 00 04 !16 53 lmp okay, joe. we just had a momentary dropoff in signal strength again there."
"roger, fred. we had an los for a minute and we lost our tv picture. it looks like - yes, we just got it back. it looks great again."
"13, houston. you might stop the f-stop down one more notch, if you got any left."
"and, 13, houston. we'll be commanding the evasive maneuver in about 17 seconds."
"dkay, joe. we aan see it start to move. however, it doesn't seem to be a lot of debris or vapor coming out of it."
"roger that, jack. booster says that's great. he says the booster's doing its thing normally. con- cur. we don't see much on the television at all."
"_nd, apollo 13, houston. we'd like to change the s-band and antenna configuration. like you to go 0mni delta. like you to go manual mode on the high gain with pitch of minus 60 and yaw of 90. over."
okay. you want us to omni delta and manual on the high gain to minus 60 and plus 90. is that correct?
that's affirmative.
"okay, houston. how much longer would you like the television?"
stand by on that. we'll get a word.
"okay, lb; this is houston. you can turn the tv off anytime you're ready. we've enjoyed the show."
"13, houston. before you secure the tv, we'd like to know whether that was in maximum zoom, just for information."
that's affirm. jim had it in max zoom.
okay. good deal. that was a real good picture.
"and, 13, houston. the aps evasive maneuver ap- l peared to be nominal. the lox dump time is now 4 plus 39 plus 20, about 3 minutes late."
roger.
"okay, joe. we are right now opening the waste stowage vent."
"okay, jack. we copy."
"okay, houston. we are charging battery b."
"roger, 13. we see it. looks good."
"apollo lb, houston. request omni alfa now. over."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"roger. they are having trouble verifying that the high gain is doing its thing. like to verify that the pitch is minus 10, the y is plus 350, you're in wide beam width and auto."
"okay. minus l0 pitch, plus 350 yaw, and wide beam width and going into auto. you want high gain, john?"
that's affirm.
"okay. here, it's coming at you. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
"ail right, houston; 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
is the s-ivb doing something different now?
"well, i don't know. it should be - let's see, it should have started the lox dump at least quite a while ago. i guess that's complete. why do you ask, fred?"
"i'm looking out window 5 at what i think is the s-ivb, and i'm seeing what looks to be double plumes, going in two very narrow bands maybe about 3 degrees that are streaming out from it. and then there is a less dense band that covers maybe a 40-degree swath through the sky that continues out, also, in two directions. 00 04 51 45 cml hey, joe, what it looks like, kind of, is if you pull up behind a guy that's pulling a con,rail, and you get in his contrail, like he's going away from you - there's a long contrail -"
okay; stand by. let me see what frank's got to say about that.
"except we're between - looks like we're between two contrails, one guy above and one below."
roger.
it's a very pretty sight.
"okay, 13; houston. the booster says that the propulsive dump is concluded; he now has the nonpropulsive vents open and what you see is a normal phenomenon and it should go on for another 5 minutes or so."
okay.
"and, while i've got you, 13, at your convenience, we'd like to have the results of the ems bias tests that you did pre-tli and pre-sep."
stand by.
okay.
"okay, joe. the tli - the delta-v no bias test prior to tli, we had a 0.8, and post-tli, it was 1.0."
"okay, jack. copy that. thank you very much. incidentally, as your tracking gets better and better, the size of mcc-2 is getting lower and lower and figures to be somewhere between 20 and 30 feet per second now."
sounds good.
"yes, sure does."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"okay. we have a ptc refsmmat ready, if you're ready to go po0 and accept, we'll stick it in there."
okay. stand by.
okay.
"okay. i'm poo and accept, joe."
okay. roger that.
"apollo 13, houston. we'll have a handover in half a minute or so. you may get a momentary loss of strength."
"okay, joe."
"apollo 13, houston. the computer is yours. over."
okay. going to block.
roger.
"okay, houston. do you copy 13's torquing angles on the p527"
"13, houston. leave them up just a second, and we'll get them down."
"13, houston. okay. we got them. o0 05 bo 46 cdr okay. the time of torquing was 5 hours bo minutes and 40 seconds. o0 05 bo 51 cc roger. we copy."
"hello, houston; apollo lb. o0 05 b9 49 cc 13, houston. go ahead."
"okay. i just got all hooked up to get in my comm system here, and i just wanted to check out. i've got my suit stowed, a few other odds and ends done, and i'm back in business again."
"okay. good deal. we're kind of hanging loose down here. i've got a lift-off plus 15 pad. there's no hurry to read it up, so let us know when you're ready."
okay.
"okay, houston. go ahead with the pad."
"okay, jim. lift-off plus 15 pad: geti 015:00, delta-vt 5622, longitude minus 165, and get 400k 047:04. over."
"okay, houston. lift-off plus 15: geti 015:00, 5622, minus 165, 045:04. is that correct?"
"that's right, jim."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, jim."
"roger. we'd like to have the attitude set switch back to gdc, if you're finished with your aline. it gives g&c down here a telemetry problem."
yes; okay.
thank you.
i'm just going to give them one more aline here.
okay. no rush. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. would you please verify or tell us what s-band antenna configuration you're in, please?"
okay. stand by.
we're in high gain.
"roger. stand by a minute, jim. our signal strength is getting a little iow. we may have a recommendation."
"13, houston. are you in manual or auto in high gain?"
"stand by. we're in auto track, joe, and high gain."
roger.
"houston, you copy 137"
"hello, houston; apollo 13. over."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"hey, were you copying my p23 results?"
"that's affirmative, jack. we followed you through the whole thing. you're ahead of schedule."
okay.
"and, joe, we confirmed there is no midcourse-1. over."
"that is affirmative as far as i know. let's get a final check on it, jim."
okay. because we're standing by. we want to do a fuel cell purge and a waste water dump.
"okay, jim. we confirm there will be no midcourse-1. 00 06 45 30 cd_ okay. it sounds good."
"and, 13, houston. you can go ahead with the purge and dump at your discretion."
"roger, houston. what we're going to do is, we're going to get rid of fred's suit here. fred's suit has been right in the commander's slot here for the last half hour. so we're going to try and get it stowed."
okay.
you did a pretty good job.
"apollo 13, houston. we'll have a handover in about 1 minute."
"hello, houston. apollo 13."
"roger, jim. we'll have a handover from hawaii to goldstone in about 30 seconds."
"say again, houston."
we'll be handing over from hawaii to goldstone in a few seconds. you may get a temporary loss of comm.
"okay, houston. we've got a whole bunch of noise, too."
"okay. houston, 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"hey, joe. do you want to dump waste water down to 25 percent. is that right?"
that's affirm.
"okay, in work."
okay.
do you know we're also purging fuel cells 02 now.
"okay, jack."
"okay, houston. the fuel cell purge and waste water dump are complete."
"roger, apollo 13. and this is your relief cap comm shift on now."
"well, good evening, vance."
"boy, you sure made it back fast."
"yes. you guys had a beautiful launch, there. really nice."
"could you follow it all the way up, vance?"
"no, i didn't see staging. it was too hazy for that, but we could see it for a few miles anyway."
"i'll tell you, it's sure an interesting ride."
right.
"houston, apollo 13."
"roger. go ahead, jim."
"roger. we're at that stage now where we're going to take some earth weather photography. if you're standing by, i have the camera aimed at the earth right now, and i'll give you a mark when i take this first picture."
"roger. we copy, jim. we'll be standing by for the mark."
"okay, houston. 3, 2, 1 -"
mark.
"roger, copy."
"and apollo 13, houston. over."
go ahead.
"for the ptc, recommend that you disable quads a and b. over."
"okay. disable quads a and b, will do; and soon as jack gets finished thrashing around, we'll be going to that ptc mode."

"okay. you want the high gain secured and you want the 0mni on omni charlie, huh? or baker?"
that's affirm. and this'll be maintained in the ptc.
okay.
"and the high gain angles for stowage - or for stowing - are pitch minus 52, yaw 270."

stand by for another earth weather picture. i'll give you a mark.
"okay. standing by, jim."

"go ahead, houston."
"houston here. your rates look very stable. it looks like your rates are damped out completely here. as far as we can see, it would be alright to start the ptc."
okay. we'll give it a try. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription
"hello, houston. this is 13. how do you read?"
"hello, 13; houston. loud and clear. 13, houston is reading loud and clear. how do you read?"
"okay. and do you have any estimate, vance, on how long we'll be charging battery b?"
"stand by 1, fred."
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"we'll be charging for 4-1/2 to 5 hours yet, jim."
roger.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"fred, recommend that, when your window comes around facing the earth again, that you catch another one of those pictures, and at the same time, you should probably start ptc again. we might have sent a confusing bit of info up to you. the ""disable two quads"" only applies to an early step in the procedure. we didn't mean that for the latter part of the procedure where we have the statement ""enable all jets."" over."
okay.
"houston, apollo 13."
"apollo 13, houston. go ahead."
"vance, fred said that you had some more informa- tion about ptc and a different way of establishing it or something, huh?"
"roger. referring to the procedure on g/8-2, if you have that open, i'll tell you what we had to give you."
okay. stand by and i'll get it out. 0008 08 lb cc okay. / pa_.c 37
"okay. (;o_lc.ad, van."
"okay. on checklist g/8-2 under step 5, tbert_'s a statement, ""disable all jets on two adjacent quads,"" and that's what we were referring to when we called up saying ""disable quads a and b."" so that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7 where it says ""enable all jets,"" we hoped that you didn't think we meant leave a and b disabled there. in that case, it's as written. ail jets should be enabled. over."
"okay. our checklist has ""all jets"" scratched out, and it says ""enable couples on all axes."" so what we'll do is - we'll reestablish this thing and come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all jets. that means enable quads a and b. is that right ?"
"that's affirm. you'll have a, b, c, and d en- abled for step 7."
"okay, real fine. i'll start on it now."
"okay. understand you're going to reestablish it. 00 08 10 46 _ and vance, on that picture, i was all set to shoot it just a little before you called, and the earth hasn't showed up in the window yet. i don't know if we got too far off the bellyband or what."
"roger. copy, fred."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, vance."
"roger. on the photo, you'll probably have to reestablish the attitude for ptc and then when- ever it comes into the window again, why we'll just be standing by for the photo."
okay.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, ..."
"roger, you're coming in a little weak. have a recommended roll rate for this ptc, if you could copy. pa_e 38"
alright. go _uhead.
"okay. recommend that you put in ri the following: 03750, and that should give you exactly a rate of 0.3 degrees per second. over."
okay. enter 03750. is plus or minus our choice?
"roger. the same direction you rolled the last time, which i believe is plus."
okay.
"hey, vance, would you monitor our rates and kind of give an idea of when you think they're stable enough to start ptc."
"roger, jack. we'll take a look and let you know as soon as they look stable enough."
okay. i've got quads a and b disabled here.
roger.
have they come up with an idea of how much fuel i used on the docking and also the p23 session at 5 hours or 6 hours.
i think we can give you something. stand by a minute.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. it's looking good so far as rcs consum- ables are concerned, jack. you're standing about 20 pounds above the curve right now. looking at the td&e, you expended 65 pounds or - stand by - 55 pounds, correction on that."
how much?
and 14 pounds on p23s. you used a little more out of quad a than out of the others.
"okay. thanks, vance."
roger.
"lley,could you say again the td&e i'uel? we've got a different - we ali heard different things."
i said 65 and then corrected that to 55 pounds. 00 08 27 55 cmp okay.

"go ahead, houston."
"jim, houston here. two items: first of all, your ptc is looking very good and it should carry you through the night; second point, have a procedure to give you, if you're ready to copy. we'd like to set three bits in the computer, and i'll explain why. 00 09 24 43 _ go ahead, vance, we're ready to copy."
"okay. the procedure is as follows: verb 25, noun 07, enter; 1331, enter; 7, enter; and enter. explanation as follows. during the p23s, there was one time when verb 37 was entered into the computer at about 16 seconds after the optics zero switch was flicked to zero. this is a very uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during - 0.4-second interval at around 16 seconds after you zero the optics, some opt-mode bits are reset; and this would mean that, if you had a ocdu fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this procedure is doing is setting these three bits back again where they should be."
"okay, vance, and i guess i'll try to be slower on that verb 37."
"yes. actually slower or faster, either one, i guess. well s yes, slower. it's a very unusual thing to have that happen."
"okay. and s houston, stand by for a mark on another picture."

"roger. we copy, fred."
"okay, vance; we've completed that procedure, and let me know if everything was okay."
"okay, thank you. we'll let you know if anything isn't okay. i'm sure it's good now."
"tell g&c and guido thanks a lot for keeping good track of me, there."
roger. they're right on the ball.
"and, 13, houston. if you would like, we can let you know about every 2 minutes before the earth should be coming into your window. we think we've got it pegged down pretty well now, and you won't have to look for it so much. you want that? 00 09 27 54 i_p yes. that would be fine, vance."
okay.
"and, 13, houston. guido says the bits are reset - rather, are set."
"okay, thanks much."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"it's time for fred to start looking for the earth, should be coming by in about a couple of minutes."
okay. he's got his head out there right now.
"yes. you've got that pretty well pegged, man. there it be."
doesn't that give you confidence?
"yes. i guess so. in a minute, you're going to hear my kitchen timer ding, and that also says the earth is there."

"well, looking at here, vance, it's hard to be convinced it's even the earth. all we see is water and clouds."
"well, i guess that's what we want. we want pictures of weather, right, clouds."
"yes, about half of itts covered with clouds."

"okay. we've got them. go ahead with the torquing, jack."
"okay. that was stars 20 and 27 and star-angle difference is five balls, and the time at torquing would be 10 hours 40 minutes 15 seconds."
"1 hour 40 minutes and 15 seconds; 20 and 27, stars; and five balls. roger."

"hey, maybe the fact that you verified that the earth really turns, we can call this haise's theory, huh? 'l'ap c 8/:' pag,e 4(,"
"very good, vance. very good."
...
"no, seriously. very interestingly, we can see on the map now that you're between guam and hawaii and a little bit north, and you're almost out 60 000 miles."
yes. i just did a p21 and we had 55 900.
okay. that's pretty good.
i'll let you look at it again here.
"incidentally, we're looking at a replay of your td&e stuff here and the tv looks pretty good. first chance some of us had had to see it."
"okay, vance. in r1, there's our altitude in tens of miles, 55 290."
okay.

okay.
"we have a sign underneath our leb dsky that ""my name is hal."""
"i can't imagine how that got there. just remember, you have to be nice to hal."

"houston, 13."
"13, houston. you're very weak. please repeat."
"vance, to my calculations, we have taken about 10 earth window photography pictures. i see nothing coming up here except to elose the waste stowage vent here in a little while. i was thinking about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty soon."
"okay. that sounds good, jim. fao here would like to request just one more picture before you bed down, if you don't mind."
okay. we'll come through with one more picture.
okay.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"a couple of items, jim. the first is, the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. if you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far as we're concerned down here to close it before that time just before you go to bed. the second point, we have some results on the p23s, and, if jack's interested, we could give him the corrected altitudes we're getting, and so forth."
"yes. i sure am, vance."
"okay. this is preliminary results, but it will give you some indication. corrected altitude is turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers, and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers indicates that you're being very consistent in judging the altitude. the effective altitude is turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers. comments are that, as i said before, you're being consistent on the horizon selection. the sub- stellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. that's the only comment there. over."
okay. we'll try doing it better next time.

"roger. we copy, and could you give us the frame number on that last picture, please?"
"okay. we've been writing them all down, vance, as we went, but that one turned out to be 29."
"roger. twenty-nine, fred."
"okay, jack says i can't read the camera very well. it should be 28 based on our start frame."
correction to 28.
"13, houston. understand, though, the number showing that you read on the camera was 28. is that affirm?"
"yes. the readability of that thing is like, you know, half a frame one way or the other; so, 28, i think, is a good number."

go ahead.
"fred, did you get any master alarms up there about 5 or 10 minutes ago? folks thought they saw some here and they were curious about it."
yes. we got another 02 flow high on - i guess it was about 5 minutes ago.
okay.
"vance, what the people down there might have been seeing is our testing."
roger. testing the caution and warning?
"yes. we were rigging the siren device over the master alarm, and we were running a test on it."
"okay. good enough. and anytime you're ready to copy, i've got a pad p37 block data."

roger. that's all correct.
okay.
"houston, 13."
roger. go ahead.
we're starting our presleep checklist and no medication.
okay. the doc says very good.
"and, houston, is there any onboard readouts that you don't have from us."
"stand by 1. we need the lm/cm delta-p for one thing, and i'll check back in a minute with the others."
okay. and we still have the vent valve open. we'll close it one of the last things and looking at lm/cm delta-p right now and i see 0.5 in psi indicated.
roger. five-tenths.
"13, houston."
go ahead.
"only other readouts we need are those on page 3-13 of the flight plan. bat c, pyro bat a, pyro bat b, rcs a, b, c, and d readings, and dc indicator select main a or b."
okay. stand by.
"and, vance, we're still charging bat b. did you want to dispense with that in a few minutes?"
"stand by on that, fred."
"okay, vance, i've got your readouts on page 3-13 of the flight plan."
okay. ready to copy.
"okay, bat c is 37, pyro bat a is 37, pyro bat b is 37, rcs a 94 percent, b 95 percent, c 93 per- cent, d 96 percent."
roger. copy that.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. in answer to the battery-charging questions, i calculate it should be fully charged at 12:35. play that one, though, the same as the waste vent. if you want to do it earlier because you're turning in, why that's fine with us."
"okay, we'll continue on with a few other things we got to get done, and just before turning in, we'll check with you, and you can remind us then."
okay.
"houston, apollo 13. give me a call when you're ready for e-memory dump."

we think the spacecraft's looking in good shape. nobody has any comment down here before you hit the hay.
okay. row do they think we stand on the way of consumables so far?
you're looking in good shape in all respects - consumables-wise.
okay. real fine.

"no, i - i was just - i'll do that for you."

"and we'll see you in the morning, huh?"
okay. it'll be just a minute or 2 yet. we have to finish up a couple more chores.

"hello, houston. houston, apollo 13. over."
"good morning, 13. this is houston. how are you?"
read you loud and clear. we had a fairly good night's sleep.
"okay. real fine. at your leisure, you can give us radiation reports, i guess. we are getting a consumables update together for you, and a few other little details whenever you are ready to talk. about the only major thing on tile spacecraft is that it's been getting farther away."
"okay. well, that's to be expected, i guess."
yes.
"and we're starting to charge battery a, houston."
"roger on battery a, fred. eecomm says battery b looks real good."
okay.
"houston, 13."
go ahead.
"okay. for information, fred was on comm last night; and he was over in the left-hand seat, and if you want our radiation readings, we just goofed. we left them all in the suits which are now nicely tucked away. we are going to get out jack's suit in an hour or so anyway, and we'll get ais dosimeter out if you wanted to get the reading on that one."
okay. that will be satisfactory.
okay.
"and in exchange for that, the surgeon would like to have a rough number of hours each of you slept and a qualitative verb to describe whether it was good, fair, or poor."
okay. stand by.
"okay, houston. we had an average of around 5 or ..."
"jim, houston. your comm got pretty garbled there just as you started to talk."
"okay. houston, apollo 13."
"okay, 13. you're loud and clear again."
"we averaged about 5-1/2 hours' sleep apiece, and we are estimating that the sleep was good."
"okay. copy that. let's see what else we have for you, jim. mideourse-2 looks like about 23 feet per second, approximately retrograde and on time. and it's holding real firm now. for your information, and you don't need to copy this down, because it's still pretty soft, but we have an s-ivb impact of about 8.57 south and about 33_9 west, which is a little west and a little south of the flight plan value. we have it at a get of about 77 plus 51 which is just before aos, and the loi pads are a little bit late, and as i say, it's still pretty soft, and we'll be updating you with firm numbers."
"that's fine, joe. just as long as it doesn't hit cone crater."
"okay. and i'll have a consumables update for you in a little while, and i have a small flight plan update for you sometime a little later on when you're ready to copy. there's no big deals in it."
roger.
"and, 13, houston. wetd like to verify that you cycled the 02 cryo fans. we saw the h2, but we didn't see the 02 get stirred up."
"yes, joe. we did, and it kind of looked like we might have had a little stratification because right after we put them on, we had a cryo press light."
"okay. eecomm told me that might happen, and he was right. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription 00 23 21 5;1 c_ j okay, joe. we're ready t.ocopy a fikht pan update and your consumables."
"okay_ jack. the flight plan update has a couple of items in it_ and the first one we'd like to do is to update the tephem values in the g&c check- list on page g/9-2. these are fairly small changes, but in case you need them, we'd like you to have the exact numbers. over."
okay. just a minute. i'll get it out.
"joe, was that the g&c checklist, page 9-2?"
"that's affirmative. g&c, page g/9-2."
okay. go ahead.
"()kay. on that page in line 04, column b, change the number from 03366 to 05253. over."
_.- 53.
"okay. and in line 05, column b, change from 11000 to 33661. over."
33661.
"okay. that's right. the only other thing i've got for you, jack, is three additional questions for the booster systems debriefing, which is to take place at about 25 hours, and we thought we'd pass these questions up to you early so you can consider them. over."
okay. we're ready to copy.
"okay. the first extra is, and let me get the original question because this question says, qmore specifically on item 2,"" and item 2 says, 'fwere there any significant changes in the noise ihration level during the single stage of powered flight?"" specifically, describe your observations during the early s-ii center engine out-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to tli cut-off_ you reported a high vibration in the s-ivb. we'd like you to describe the buildup of this vibration and its behavior through cut- off. over."
"okay. essentially, what you'd like us to talk about is vibration sequence during the early s-ii cut-off of the center engine and also describe the vibrations that we encountered during the s-ivb tli burn. is that correct?"
"_ that's it. okay. the second extra question is for you, jim, and it says, ""comparing this flight with your ride on apollo 8, were there any sig- nificant differences in the powered flight environment?"""
okay. we'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13 as far as powered flight goes.
"roger. and the last additional question is what did the ordeal ball look like during tli? as you know, we passed you an update to that setting, and we'd like to know whether it was riding right on zero or what during the burn. over."
okay. will do. we'll describe the ordeal ball.
"()kay. that's it, and that's the whole flight plan update. i have a consumables update now if you want to listen to that."
"()kay,joe. we're ready to copy."
"()kay. at 23 hours the total rcs is 1121, quad a _s 274, quad bravo is 286, quad charlie is 274, quad delta is 287, and the cryos are as follows: h2 tank 1, 83 percent; h2 tank 2, 86 percent; 02 tank 1, 87 percent; 02 tank 2, 87 percent. over."
"okay, joe. we got all those, and how do we com- pare them with where we should be in the time sine?"
"as i understand it, jack, you're running slightly ahead of nominal in both those areas."
okay; real fine.
no problem.
"and, 13, houston. that's all the business i got right now. i have a little news and plan of the day for you, if you feel like listening to that a little later on. 00 _ _-s 28 30 cdr just hold off ti, illlc hii. i,ilcr'c, joc, i1' you don't mind ...."
"stand by one, jim. you're coming in _arl)lcd :q.':ait_."
"houston, 13."
"okay, 13; houston. loud and clear again. go ahead."
"okay. joe. on the news, jim would like to hold off a little bit on that, and i want to make a request to fao, if he will at sometime during the day, when we get a flight plan update with those activities we agreed to make optional during lunar orbit and the few activities we were going to delete, i think that i forgot and left that card back during the press of suiting, i left it in the suit room."
okay. wilco.
"okay, jack. i understand fao's working on that and we'll have something for you later on."
okay. we're not in any hurry.
roger.
"okay, houston; 13."
okay. jack. we copy the angles. you can go ahead and torque them.
okay. joe. the time of torquing will be 23 hours 47 minutes 30 seconds.
we copy.
"houston, 13."
"_3, houston. go ahead."
"for information, joe, we're all configured back again now to our regular seating positions, if you're monitoring us."
"okay. thank you, jim."
"hello there, houston; 13. tape 6/4 paa__ 61"
"13, houston. (_n_o_ead."
"gosh, we had forgotten, but we'd like to hear what the news is."
"okay. there's not a whole lot to it. well, let's see, we'll start with the - let's start with sports, what the heck. the astros survived 8 to 7, the braves got five or six runs in the - five runs in the ninth inning, but they just made it; and in the other important game of the day, the cubs were rained out. i have all the rest of the scores, you can tell me if you want any of them. they had earthquakes in manila and other areas of the island of luzon. there were three tremors and they kept the buildings shaking for about a half an hour or so, and it was about a 5 on the richter scale. okay, let's see. the beatles have an- nouneed they will no longer perform as a group. the quartet is reported to have made in excess of a half billion dollars during their short musical career. however, rumors that they will use this money to start their own space program are false."
maybe we could borrow some.
"(laughter) okay. okay; west german chancellor willy brandt, who witnessed your launch from the cape yesterday, and president nixon will complete their round of talks today. brandt reportedly came to the u.s. to seek assurance from the president to go ahead with talks with the eastern european nations, especially east germany, poland, and russia. many air traffic controllers are still out, but reports indicate that they are slowly returning to work, and you'll be happy to know the controllers here in the mocr are still on the job. 01 00 18 04 cdr"
go ahead.
i said thank goodness for that.
"okay. some truck lines are being struck in the midwest, and the school teachers have walked off the job in minneapolis. today's favorite pasttime across the - uh oh; have you guys completed your income tax? o1 o0 18 _ cdr how do i apply for an extension? o 00 18 31 cc (laughter)"
"yes, joe. i got to - hey, listen - it ain't too funny; things kind of happened real fast down there, and i do need an extension."
(laughter)
i didn't get mine filed. and this is serious; would you - -
you're breaking up the room down here.
- - because i may be spending time in a - -
we'll see - - 01 00 18 52 c_ip i may be spending time in a - i may be spending time in another quarantine besides the one that they are planning for me.
"we'll see what we can do, jack. we'll get with recovery and see if we can get the agent out there $n the pacific when you come back. by golly, let's see. in professional basketball, the nicks beat the milwaukee bucks 110 to 102, and billy casper :s leading the masters after 54 holes with a 208, _nd spring football practice is in full swing. and that's about all the news we got; the updated plan of the day for you guys, tileuniform will be service dress inflight coverall garments with swords and medals, and tonight's movie shown in the lower equipment bay will be john wayne, lou costello, and shirley temple in the ""the flight of apollo 13."" 0ver."
outstanding.
"houston, this is 13. is it true that jack's in- come tax return was going to be used to buy the ascent fuel for the lm?"
"well, considering that he's a bachelor and hasn't got that deduction to take, yes."
"hey, joe. i'm glad you brought that up, because i was really serious about that."
"okay, jack. we'll - we'll take care of it. tom stafford says he'll get an extension for you."
okay.
"and jim mcdivitt says, ""yes, now that you mention it, he forgot to fill the ascent stage."""
(laughter) suspicions confirmed.
"should give you very good performance on descent. 01 00 21 11 i24p we should have a lot more hover time, huh?"
that's right.
"okay, crew. about the only other thing i've got for you right now is an update to your p37 pad for lift-off plus 35. this is a change to the pad we gave you yesterday. the reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the mid-pacific landing area at 70 hours, which is the return time for this pad, and in case the question arises in your mind, we don't expect any problem there for she end of the mission. the weather area is 20 degrees south of your end-of-mission landing point, and it appears to be moving to the south."
"okay, joe. i'm ready to copy the pad."
"()kay. get of ignition is 035:00, delta-v t 7883, longitude minus 155, and the get 400k 069:54. over."
"geti is 035:00, 7883, minus 155, 069:54."
okay.
"and, houston, jack's going to try donning his suit now for practice, himself, and when he gets it out, we'll give you a dosimeter reading."
()kay. real good.
"houston, apollo 13."
"%3, houston. go."
"okay. we've retrieved jack's dosimeter, and it's reading 02022."
"okay. we copy 02022 on the dosimeter, jim."
that's affirm.
"13, houston. at your convenience, we'd like the lm/cm delta-p reading."
that reading is 0.65 psi.
copy 0.65. thank you. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription
"apollo 13, houston."
"houston, apol ... roger. we're thinking together. and we're here waiting for your call."
"okay, you were a little broken up there, jim, but i think it's getting better. we are ready for the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever you are."
"okay, houston; apollo 13. you were cut out again; say again, please."
"roger, jim. we are ready for the launch-vehicle- systems debriefing whenever you are. over."
okay. stand by 1.
"okay, houston; 13. in answer to question l, the changes in noise level occurred mainly between the first stage and the other stages - the other stages were about the same in noise level, very quiet, with the first stage, of course, making quite a bit of noise in the beginning but - which built up during the high q, and then ... went quiet just after high q."
"okay, copy that, jim."
i might mention that the noise level during the first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable at all.
roger. and i assume comm was okay.
that's affirm. comm was very good all during - throughout the entire flight. much better than i expected.
okay.
"now, in answer to question 2, there was, of course, a vibration transient in the second stage that - due to the number 5 engine going out - which occurred shortly before the engine went out, and slightly after that then the s-ii stage was very smooth."
"okay, jim. i guess the significant point there is that you didn't notice the vibration before you saw the engine light."
"that's right. we - we noticed the vibration but it wasn't such that we thought something cata- strophic was going to happen; it just started vibration and then the en light came on, and then the vibration went away and the stage itself was smooth."
"okay, copy that."
"yes, and that - it was all pretty - pretty short in span - just a second or so before and like a second afterwards, joe."
oh. roger.
"and on the s-ivb, the vibration of the vehicle it- self wasn't what ... second ... powered flight - a very-high-frequency vibration."
"that was - was that during - just during tli, or did you notice that at insertion?"
"well, it was a high-frequency viola - vibration but more noticeable during the tli burn than it was during the ... flight."
"okay, i - understand."
"i guess the s-ivb vibration during tli was there all the time although it seemed to - to grow to us as the burn progressed, although that may have been just due to the boost weight decrease."
"okay, you called this about 3-1/2 minutes, but i guess the thing was slowly building up throughout the whole burn. right?"
that's right.
"okay, was it uncomfortable or did it cause your vision to degrade or anything like that?"
"no, it - it was not uncomfortable at all but i was recalling the ride on 8, and the s-ivb was more - much more smooth than even it was on 13. /"
copy that.
"okay, now, in answer to number 3, we did not ex- perience any unexpected transients except that all of us noticed the pu shift. we thought it was more pronounced than we had expected it to be."
okay. understand.
"joe, on that. i guess most of every time that pu shift occurred we all - almost all of us glanced at the engine light. we could feel definite acceleration change."
"roger. understand, jack."
"and, during the high-q portion of the flight, the alfa meter, to my knowledge, nearly went above 25 percent."
okay.
"in answer to number 4, we got a pretty good look at the thermal shroud and the iu after taking the lm away, and from our viewpoint, the shroud was completely intact. i saw no loose particles or parts of it floating at all."
"okay, jim. understand."
"and, i guess we answered number 5. i don't think at any time did we have any communication problem during powered flight."
roger.
"in answer to number 6, the answer is essentially no. we saw no venting or suspected leak on the lm or the csm ..."
"okay, jim. i guess you described to us the non- propulsive venting on the s-ivb after the aps maneuver and we copied that at the time."
okay. fred saw the s-ivb venting.
"yes, we had already talked about that, joe. and that was also visible when it - of course, when it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking at it right close up."
roger.
"okay, joe. the last time we saw the s-ivb posi- tively was when fred saw it venting at about - at about 5 hours. we think we might have picked it up later on. we saw a particle or something out there that was tumbling which might have been the booster or one of the sla panels."
"and when was that, jim?"
we're - we're debating. it was somewhere between - say 7:30 and 9 hours.
okay.
"but, joe, assuming the s-ivb is still stable. the object i was looking at was definitely tumbling."
"okay, fred. as i recall, it was stable then, although it's tumbling now."
okay. it probably was the sla panel i picked up.
"right. incidentally, i guess the guys in build- ing 6 - -"
oh and i think we -
"go ahead, jim."
"i - i think we answer to number 9. we - at around 5:32, i think, was when we think the number 5 light came on in the s-ii, and a definite vibration which was more than just a high-frequency vibration we got with the normal s-iv burn, and then the light came on. i called eco thinking from the training that it was 7:42 and looked up at the time and realized it was early. and then, soon after the light came on, the vibration stopped and the engine or the booster smoothed down. it was very smooth from there on."
"okay. this may be a stupid question, but do you have any idea what the frequency of it was?"
only to say that it was much higher - i couldn't really guesslinow. it was rather a rapid longi- tudinal vibration.
"okay, jim. stand by now for a minute, we're going to switch omni."
"houston, 13, _.."
"13, houston. i read you. we still have quite a bit of noise on the loop."
i'll stand by. roger.
"okay, jim. it should be pretty good now. we copied you answering question number 9."
do you want any more comments on the s-ivb vibrations?
"i don't think so. when you get all done, i'll - i'll make a quick check to see if the booster people have any - any additional questions. you skipped number 8, jim; could you go back to that for a second?"
"okay, stand by."
"our only comment there, joe, was that the burn on tli, to our knowledge, was about 3-3/4 second longer than had been predicted and that was the only thing that we really noticed; otherwise, looked like pi ? was nominal at cut-off."
"okay, understand."
"okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to apollo 8, lift-off was about the same amount of vibration as i noticed on 8, but at the beginning of the flight, there was less of the sideways motion than we experienced on apollo 8. the s-ic separa- tion felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8, maybe that's because i was in a different seat, i don't know. but there was about three sharp transients of the cut-off and a couple of big bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally on our straps before the s-ii went off. and the s-ii was, of course, just as smooth on 13 as 8 except for the number 5 engine. and we did not experience the vibration that we experienced on 8 towards the end of the s-ii burn. and the s-ivb was - had more vibration than we had on 8."
"okay, jim, got all that."
"the up - the update on the ordeal ball was a good one. at the burn, we were about - just about 8 degrees. we had to pitch down. the yaw was right on all the way through the entire burn, and just towards the end of the burn, the ball started going black in pitch a little bit."
"okay, sounds good, we'll give mike wash a gold star on that one. okay, jim, stand by 1 while i see if we have any extra questions."
"jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any more questions, i'd like to read you the booster people's preliminary analysis on the - the s-ii cut-off. over."
that would be very interesting. go ahead.
"okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the center s-ii engine vibrated at a some- what higher amplitude than we've seen on previous flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into the s-ii burn. as a result of these vibrations, the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust- okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off. early evaluation of data indicates that no damage occurred to the engine, and the cause of the in- creased vibration amplitude is still under inves- tigation. over."
i thought it was the center engine.
"yes, right."
"joe, do you have any word on what marks we had for tli?"
"at the time of tli, as i recall, you had 6 seconds longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds longer than the b-sigma iow burn, and you were also go for a second-opportunity tli if we had re- quired one."
"okay, we were just wondering because it appeared to us that we had a longer tli burn than had been predicted. o1 01 28 bo cc yes, you did. we confirmed that - that - that cut-off time just about as you saw it, and i don't have an explanation for it, but it was within the b-sigma margin."
"13, houston."
go ahead.
"roger, we have no further questions. all the answers were clear and satisfactory, and we thank you very much. you can press on with the rest of your busy day. o o 30 02 cdr right-o. 01 ()229 08 lmp and, houston; 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"okay, joe. out window 5, i just picked up the tumbling object again so, for sure, it must have been a sla panel. i don't think we could still be in the proximity of the s-iv at this time."
"i don't think so, fred. it's several hundred miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number, i'm told. and since the sla panel didn't make the midcourse correction, that might be it. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription psge 72"
"yes, it's, i can't really tell for sure even through the ,_nocular that it is, but it looks the same relative position to the stars. and the best i can tell about the same intensity and still about the same distance from us."
"can you see it tumbling. does it have a shape, or is it a point?"
"no. i can tell it's tumbling; i guess the flat side not only is facing me, it's not only much brighter, it also grows larger."
okay. very interesting. we'll see if we can figure out where that's relative to you. they keep updating the s-iv impact on us a little bit. the last guess we had was that it will impact about the sue longitude we gave you but close to zero latitude and a little bit later. you still won't be able to see it. and they're say- ing it might make a - -
roger.
"- - they're saying it might make a 100 to 120 foot crater, too."
it'll still be past the terminator for us for awhile.
"right. it will be at about the rev 20 terminator, so it will be late in your lunar orbit activities before you will be able to photograph it, and fao is looking at whether we can work that in or not."
okay.
"houston, 13."
"lb, houston. 01 02 4b 33 cmp hey, joe? is fao ready to - do you - or are you ready to give me those items that we made optional and deleted in the solo book?"
"jack, we are not quite ready with that yet, but we will be before too long. can you wait awhile?"
sure can. got lots of time. o1 02 43 5_ cc okay.
"hello, houston; apollo 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"just a passing comment, joe. we're having lunch right now, and i just made myself a hotdog sandwich with catsup. very tasty and almost unheard of in the old days."
"that's correct, lb. as i recall the flight plan, you're supposed to put mustard on the hot dogs and not catsup, but i guess we'll overlook that."
we blew it.
right. how's everything going?
"it's going pretty good. we have about four dif- ferent methods of spreading catsup, right now."
"okay. jack, we'll have your update to you before too long."
"okay. fine, joe. we did a pit check on the hycon camera and everything works okay."
okay. beautiful. we don't have anything else for you at the moment. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription
"houston, 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
okay. we'd like to get the fm up now to look at some inside pictures there.
okay. stand by and i'll get a go on this.
"13, houston."
go ahead.
"that's acceptable, fred, and meanwhile, when you guys are ready to copy, we've got an mcc-2 pad for you."
okay. stand by 1.
"roger that. and also if you can go to p00 and accept conveniently, we'd like to uplink."
okay. you've got it.
okay.
"okay, joe. you can go ahead with the p30 pad."
"okay. here we go. mcc-2, sps/g&n: 63634; plus 0.96, minus 0.23; 030:40:49.00; minus 0021.7, minus 0001.7, minus 0008.0; 080, 164, 326; n/a, n/a; 0023.2, 0:03.5 - we'll give you half a second on the burn time because it's so short - 0018.5; 44, 135.9, 28.1; and the rest is n/a. comments: set stars 31 and 23; roll aline 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage, lm weight 33499, and over."
"okay. mcc-2, sps/g&n: 63634; plus 0.96, minus 0.23, 030:40:49.00; minus 0021.7, minus 0001.7, minus 0008.0; 080, 164, 326; n/a, n/a; 0023.2, burn time 0:03.5, 0018.5; 44, 135.9, 28.1; and the rest n/a. set stars 31, 23; roll aline 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage, lm weight 33499."
"roger. readback correct. i have two more short comments on them, but i want to wait just a second and make sure i understand them before i pass them to you. 01 04 52 25 ij_' okay."
"okay, fred; houston."
go ahead.
"the two additional comments were just that, first of all, they biased delta-v c by minus 0.34 feet per second based on your ems null bias cheeks. that's just for information. and the second one also for information is that your targeted pericynthion is 60 miles after this correction."
"okay, understand. for jack's information the ems delta-v bias is 3.4, and our targeted pericynthion after this meueuver is 60 miles."
"that's correct on the pericynthion. the ems bias is 0.34, very small."
okay. 0.34 on the ems delta-v bias.
roger. and - -
"hey, joe, we'll give - -"
"go ahead, jack - -"
"we'll give you - we'll give you the read - we'll give you the results of another null bias test for comparative purposes right before the - oh, at the proper time."
okay. real fine; and the computer is yours.
okay. thank you. going block.
"okay, houston; 13. are you copying the torquing angles on the p527"
"okay, jack. give us a second."
"and, 13, houston. we have them. you can torque them."
"okay, joe. time of torquing 29 hours 0 minute 30 seconds."
"roger that. 0i 05 29 35 cc apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"hey, you've got a new oapcom on now with the black crew, and we have about three items to give you, jack."
okay. stand by 1. are these updates or what?
"i'm going to give you some high gain antenna angles for tv and the rest is just information, general words."
go ahead ...
"okay. burn attitude for tv, your pitch and yaw angles are as follows: pitch minus i - minus 69, yaw 180, high gain."
okay.
okay. second point is that you're go for mcc-2. everything's looking good here.
okay. real fine.
"and the last item's for jack. jack, the pre- liminary indications are that you can get a 60-day extension on your - filing your income tax if you're out of the country."
that's good news. i guess i qualify.
"yes, we were just looking at the map, and you're south of florida so you're not in the country now. but we wondered how about your car tags. have you taken care of those?"
"yes, i did, as a matter of fact. i think i did:"
"known as, ""plan ahead."""
okay. good.
"and, apollo 13, houston. recommend omni alfa until you get to the burn attitude."
okay. omni alfa. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription
"okay, houston; apollo 13."
"13, go ahead."
"okay, vance. the ems delta-v pass passive, the results of the no-bias pass in 100 seconds, have been from 100 to 101.5."
"roger. copy plus 100 to plus 101.5, and that agrees fairly closely with the last one, as i recall."
okay. fine.
"okay, houston. we're at p40 burn attitude. jim is on the sextant star check, and we do have a star in the sextant."
"roger, jack. copy. very good."
but we oould't tell you whether it's 44 or not.
whoops.
"okay, houston; 13. we're a little bit ahead of ourselves. do we have a go to do the fuel cell purge and the waste water dump?"
"jack, that's affirm. you have a go for those."
okay. we're on our way.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"jim, battery a is charged now. whenever you want to unhook it will be fine with us."
okay.
"houston, 13. are you still planning to have tv at the scheduled time?"
"okay, 13; houston. that's affirm. at the flight- plan-scheduled time."
okay. all right. we've got a beautiful sight we want to show you.
right.
"13, houston. you can go ahead with the tv now. we're standing by."
okay. here it comes.
okay.
"okay. jack. it's coming in, and it's right in the center of our screen."
"okay, vance."
"can you - think you could guess what that might be, vance? better than charlie?"
i don't want to start flipping coins at this point.
"okay, vance. we're pointed just a little ways off from looking directly at the moon. jim is holding the camera through window 3. the sun is coming at about 40 degrees off our left side, and what we are going to show you in just a minute is about 30 seconds of waste water dump and just show you just what it looks like. it's really fantastic."
okay. we'd like to see that.
"okay. we saw some droplets speeding out for a little while, jack. now we don't see anything."
"actually, vance, what you're looking at is solid water droplets coming out just about all the time. it lights up the whole sky around the moon. it's just far too fine for you to see. now i think they're coming out a little thicker."
"okay. yes, we see those."
jack's complaining about seeing stars.
fido says he can understand why that would perturbate a trajectory now.
"it's amazing watching these little frozen droplets maneuver. they seem to go in all directions, but finally after they get out a certain ways, settle down and they all seem to be traveling in the same direction. 0! 06 16 42 cc right. that's coming in real well."
the objects in the foreground are parts of the lm that you're looking at.
the camera is now going to ...
we can just barely see those parts of the lm. they must be in a shadow.
okay. now you are looking at a thruster quad at the lower part of your screen.
"i've got the f-stop all the way open now, vance; that's quad - quad i you're looking at with the lm should - the moon should be in view just over the top of the quad."
"right. we see the nozzle of the quad, but it's dark and it's not easy to see."
"13, houston. inco suggests you try average if you're in peak to see if that gives us a better picture."
okay. we're in average now.
i think that helps out. we can see it better.
"okay. now, 13, request you either move it away from the bright area or else move it back to peak. over."
"okay, vance. i cranked the focus down a little bit. is the quad coming in any better now?"
"it's coming in about the same, fred, and you're a little weak now on the comm.."
we could see when you went back to peak.
and i'm now ... all the way out.
"okay. we could see you zoom in on the moon, and it's near the center of our screen, just a little to the left. very clear."
yes. i show it just about at 38.
"we can't tell if it's gray or light brown, though."
"do you have your grid down there, vance?"
"that's negative, fred."
okay.
"i don't know if you can make out the features there, vance, on the moon, but it looks like the terminators are at central plains area somewhere around descartes, maybe. 01 06 22 h5 cc okay. we're -we see it just as a bright portion of the lunar disk, and it looks a lot like you see it from earth. very bright. we are unable to see any features at all."
"it's pretty much the same with the eyeballs in here, and it looks a little bigger now. but the only way i could see it very good at all was with the monocular, a little while ago."
"okay, fred. very good. we'd be interested to seeing the cabin when you get ready for that, too. 01 06 23 39 _ okay. i'll set up now."
"and, vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2, we're up to, in our checklist, to minus' 6 minutes to go."
"roger. minus 6 minutes. understand you're about ready to turn on the gimbal motors and all that sort of thing. okay. we see the computer now in the upper middle part of the - the panel. i think we see somebody's checklist in the center couch. it must be jim holding the checklist. 01 06 2_ 39 lmp right. and what jim's holding now, he's got a pen in his hand we've rigged on a string, as sort of a simple-minded accelerometer. this burn's pretty short and i'm not sure even that's going to show very much. but we'll see if it'll stretch out at the end of its string."
yes. we see the pencil at the top of the picture floating around. and jack's coming into view now.
"and i've gone back - okay, i've gone back to average now and ... pitch up."
roger.
"now in a few minutes, vance, i guess we'll see how about the only system we haven't used yet works. everything else sure has worked mighty fine."
right. the spacecraft's really working nicely. okay. we're picking up panel 2 now. still a little bit of the checklist.
wondering if you can pick up the caution array there?
right. we just saw your - your testing of the caution and warning system at the left-hand side of the panel on our tv. see the lights all flash on. you're doing it again.
"you mission timer's showing up as a - a brilliant green in the upper left-hand part of the picture. g1 06 30 12 lmp roger. i got the camera kind of canted on you here, vance."
"vance, jim's going to go to vox now."
"vance, how do you - -"
"roger. read you loud and clear, jim."
okay. we'll - what we'll do - we'll be on vox for the remainder of the burn and preburn count- down. 01 06 30 38 sc
... and what we're waiting for is 5_ minutes on our counter or 20 which would be minus - -
"jim, we hear clipping on your vox. could you adjust it so that you're coming in continuously all the time?"
okay. stand by 1.
"l, 2, 3, 4, 5. how's that, vance?"
okay. that's better.
"vance, how do you read the cmp on vox?"
"jack, read you loud and clear."
okay. fine.
we show minus 8-1/2 minutes.
roger. houston copies. 01 06 32 h_ sc close --
"is that too close, vance, or can you make out the sps engine panel now?"
"we can see your fuel and oxidizer gages and hydrogen/oxygen gages at the top of the picture and the pugs, but it isn't coming in in focus too well. it's a little dim."
yes. i think the problem is i'm about 2 feet and it doesn't go down but to 4.
right. we understand that's the panel right in front of your face.
"okay. vance, stand by for the main ..."
okay. we're minus 7 minutes.
roger.
"fred, the focus is good enough that we can see the position of your four ball valves at the top of the picture for the big sps engine."
"what would you like to watch, vance?"
"hopefully, you'll see the - or we'll see the two on the left here, set a, go on here directly - -"

"okay. houston copied your residuals, very iow."
"okay. fuel is 1.0; oxidizer 0.25; the ox un- balance is reading on the decrease, which doesn't mean very much, and i guess that wasn't too much for a push there, vance. i didn't see the accel- erometer do a whole lot and it was a little sur- prising how slowly the injector valves opened, at least on the indicators."
"roger. that was a very short burn. request you give us a sweep across the panel when you get a chance, fred. let us see jack and jim again. over."
okay.
"okay, vance, i was going to show you on - wonder if the folks might - down there might be inter- ested in how we find out how far we're away from the moon. going to do that right now in pro- gram 21 here."
okay.
i'm asking the computer how far away we are. and the computer is telling me we're 121 490 miles out.
okay. that agrees fairly closely with our map on the wall.
i'm glad. that means you're tracking us too.
"and if you didn't see our residuals, it was 0.1 x, 0.2 on y, and 0.1 z, and delta-v c was minus 3.8."
"jack, houston. we show you down here 121 thou- sand miles 520 out. so i guess we all agree."
"okay. real good, vance. what i'm going to do is give you a shot of fred."
if we can get all the wiring out of the way.
"the big problem here is, when you move the tv around, this wire follows you like a snake here."
"yes, we have fred now. looks like he has a lariat there, getting ready to rope the checklist."
"that's only half of it. we have most of it hidden away. it's been pretty interesting doing all the camera work here to get a little extra training running the tv here, hopefully for when we get on the ground at fra mauro. the monitor does make it pretty easy though."
right. that's a real advantage in the cockpit. you're just a little bit dark. it looks like it might help to have the f-stop run down about one increment. see how it comes out - -
"can't do it, we're wide open."
are you?
i think we're wide open - -
"yes. we're wide open, vance."
"okay. does that help any, vance?"
"okay. it's reasonablly good. we can make out fred fairly well. looks like he's in a shadow. hey, that helps. you just turned up the lights, huh?"
yes. we went fixed on the - -
okay. you're on candid camera.
"we did notice one thing, vance. you know that new fad with long hair? it won't work too well up here in space."
what was that one again?
"i say, you know the new - the new fad with long hair?"
right.
"it doesn't work too well up in space, you can't comb your hair up here."
"well, i guess you have to give up something."
"well, at least it - it helps to try. we can see you trying to comb your hair there, jim. it looks like your - your beards haven't come along to the point where you've had to use the razor though."
"well, we've been debating that. we thought we'd take care of our beards tomorrow and make that one of our daily routines."
"i take it that was a subtle hint, vance."
"no, no. we're not commenting on your appearance, f_red. i mean nothing derogatory, understand."
"_n_d, vance, thought we'd get a picture of jack just so that all the girls know that he's still here."
(laughter)
...
"yes, we - we appreciate that. there he is. big jack."
"jack, you're in the shadow right now; we have a little bit of interference from your window, which is very bright, so we can't - i think you're smiling, but it's a little hard to tell."
"... fa_e 90 01 06 47 1_ cc hey, there we go. incidentally, we've been getting ali kinds of tits of information to pass up to you. we've had baseball scores coming in, basketball. somebody said there's 220 days, shopping days left until christmas. o1 06 47 46 cml yes. who won the masters, vance?"
"it was a tie in the masters and stand by. it was a tie between littler and casper after 72 holes, and there is going to be a playoff monday, we understand."
oh. sounds good.
"one thing the world might be interested in knowing is what you do after the burn in the way of configuring switches back. we - we heard you go through the checklist. but, i guess right now, basically, you probably have all the switches back in position and you're in the mode to con- tinue on with - okay. what does the flight plans say? you're going to be doing cislunar naviga- tion. so, jack you're going to be down in the leb. is that correct?"
"that's right, vance. be going down there shortly."
okay. the tv now is all but black. looks like it must be pointing into a shadow.
"what he's doing, he's trying to give you one more shot of the moon, and right now i'm setting to maneuver pad and the optics calibration attitude."
roger.
"and what i wanted to point out, i don't know if it's apparent, but ... to show the advantage of doing all the dumps just before the burn, we're looking again at the same scene over quad i at the moon. and now you don't see all the sparkly frozen particles outside there any more. we've sort of run off and left them."
"roger. we - we don't see anything out there any- more in the way of particles leaving the space- craft. we'd suggest, maybe you zoom the moon in a little bit again so we can see the shape of it better."
okay. that brings the moon in. we can see the terminator at the top of'the melon-shaped disk.
okay. now you can see a few of the spark - sparkling particles going across the screen. those are being emitted from the thrusters. jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now.
"okay. we can see those very poorly. well, actually, they are coming in better now. it looks like little specks going from the upper left part of the screen across to the right, and understand those are from the thrusters."
that's affirm.
"okay, 13; houston. just as an item of interest, advise your speed with respect to the earth is now 4667 feet per second."
"okay. thanks, vance."
"okay, apollo 13; houston. the moon has been in and out of the - the - our screen here. right now it's off at the bottom side, but we can still see the particles coming off of the spacecraft."
"okay. i am going to have to pull it out the window now, vance. the sun's coming up on the right side."
roger. understand. you - -
"do you want to see any shots down in the leb, vance? o1 06 55 b1 cc say again."
do you want to see any of the photographs or do you want the tv down in the leb?
"that's right, jim. it would be good to see what you are doing down in the leb or the far corner of the spacecraft where the optics are. might be interesting to describe what you will do in the next few minutes in the way of sighting."
"okay, vance. first we are going to give you a shot of the sleep station."
"okay. the camera's bounced around a little, but we can see the green computer come in every once in a while."
"while jack is getting the sleep station rolled up, i thought i would show you one interesting corner. we've got a temporary stowage bag here and that's where all our wastepaper and all that goes while we're - after every meal. it's in the right-hand corner down by our dump system."
roger. understand. we're looking at the wastebasket.
"and the age-old question that is always asked us is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that line that you see, i think you can see it now, it goes right outside where we open up the over- board drain dump, and all of our waste products, liquid waste products, go out through that line and get dumped overboard."
"roger. understand, and we can see somebody's foot, as well."
"okay. fred is now going down there, and he is going to try to get underneath the sleep station on his side where we have a sleep restraint. and the whole object of that is to ... to position the body between the - between the bottom of the spacecraft and - so it doesn't float up between that and the bottom of the couch."
roger. the sleep restraint of the hammock is coming into view underneath the couch. it's the white object.
you perhaps can see the zipper of the h_mock right now. it's the black lines in that white object.
right. we can see it.
"these hammocks, by the way, are very comfortable. when we first heard about them in the design of apollo, we thought they weren't necessary, but they turned out to be very nice devices to sleep in."
"i'm trying now to get down there with fred to show you how it works. i keep floating up, though, but maybe we can get a little shot here."
"okay. we have somebody upside dow_ in the photograph now. realizing, of course, in - in space there is no really rightside up or upside down. it still looks that way to us."
"okay. that's - that's fred now. i'm trying to put him rightside up, for you folks back there in the sleep station. fred, would you move your hands there so the folks back home can see you?"
"okay. that's coming in real clear, jim. we see fred in the sleep restaint - restraint."
"as a matter of fact, vance, i find my - i find fred down there all the time. g1 07 o0 44 cc yes. i can see he appreciates that. looks fairly comfortable."
"looks like there is a lot of room down there, considering all the boxes on the floor and under- neath the couch."
"it's surprising. there still is quite a bit of room down there even with the hycon camera box down. and now, i'm going to bring the camera back up."
"okay, vance. if there is no more that you would l_ke to see right now, we'll terminate our little tv for you today."
"okay. thank you very much, jim. appreciated seeing inside the spacecraft and getting a look at the moon that you're rapidly approaching."
roger. this is odyssey saying goodby.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
o'kay. at your convenience we have an item to give you which will have to be copied. it's information on how to photograph comet bennett at time 32 hours get. over.
okay. stand by i minute.
okay.
"okay, vance. go ahead."
"okay. time 32 hours 00 minutes get. instructions at completion of p23, maneuver to following atti- tude: roll 01.0, pitch 090.0, yaw 000.0. high gain antenna angles will be: pitch minus 23, yaw 93. use normal ptc procedures to dampen rates. after vehicle's stable, and before spinup, take photographs of comet bennett. use the dac on the sextant with magazine g. that is, very high-speed black-and-white film, right? that's the dim-light film. take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure. use auto optics. noun 88 values are r1 plus 34717, r2 minus 08028; r3 plus 35075. take three photos one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-second time exposure using manual optics. shaft will be 000.8 degrees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. comment: strip off about 50 frames; that is, 2 seconds of - at 24 feet per second be- fore the first frame and after the last frame of the photos. that is, 2 second - 2 seconds at 24 frames per second - before the first frame and after the last frame of photos."
"is that it, vance?"
and that's all.
"okay. the time is - the event will be at 32:00; and we're to maneuver to the following attitude; roll 101.0, pitch 090.0, yaw all zips. high gain angles will be pitch minus 23, yaw 93. and we're to use normal ptc procedures to damp the rates. and after damping the rates and before spinup, we're to put the dac on the sextant with the magazine g, very high-speed black and white film. then, we're to take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure using audio - auto optics. our noun 88 values ri plus 34717, r2 minus 08028, r3 plus 35075. thence, three more photos, one each at 5-, 20-, 60-seconds' time exposure using manual optics. shaft 0.8 de- grees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. and we're to take 2 - second bursts at 24 frames per second, before and after these pictures."
"your readback is correct, fred. end 0f tape apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcrifion"
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, for ptc tonight, request that you disable quads c and d. that's the opposite of last night. over."
"okay. for ptc tonight, disable quads c and d."
"roger. and advise in approximately an hour, we'll have some read-ups whenever you're ready to take them regarding solo book changes."
okay. we'll be standing by for it.
roger.
"houston, 13."
"go ahead, 13."
have you all got a chance to look at the data on the sps yet?
"stand by 1, fred."
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"fred, it looks good, but they haven't had a chance to evaluate everything. they'll probably be finished with looking at strip charts in about 15 minutes, and after that we'll try to get back with you."
okay. thank you.
roger.
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"on the p33, just like to verify that you changed the noun 88 values for this last star. it looks like they haven't been changed. over."
"okay, vance."
"that's better. let's read you what we - what we have. we have what they had in the flight plan, and if it's been changed from the flight plan, we don't have it."
stand by 1.
"we think you're right, vance. it looks like they used the same set of noun 88 for both stars by mistake."
"okay, very good. o1 07 )4404 cmp okay, vance. that ought to complete the p23s, right?"
"okay. very good, jack."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"we have some results on your - your first star, if you'd like to hear them. the rest of the stars we'll - we'll have to give you in a couple of hours. over."
go ahead.
"okay, the first star: the corrected altitude, 15 kilometers plus or minus 4; effective altitude, 12 kilometers plus or minus 7. as far as the substellar point, the value is arc-minutes - 2 arc-minutes, and that's very good. and, like i said, we'll get back with you in a couple of hours for the rest."
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
go ahead.
"okay. we have several items, here. first, is a reminder on the ptc that ri should be 375 - 0.375 degrees as last night, to get 0.3-degree rotation rate. the second one - -"
okay. copy that.
"okay. the second one, at 32 hours looking at bennett's comet - we want the pictures taken when the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be before starting ptc. the stability requirement is very high. we weren't sure if you understood that from what we passed up. in addition, the photographs might not show as much as the eye can see of the comet, so if you see anything interesting about the structure of the comet, why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged. over."
"okay, vance. what we'll do is, when we get to attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we did last night; we'll let guido and you people down there tell us when you think we are stable enough; then we'll do all this work with the dac on the sextant, first; and then when we get that done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece back on and see what we can observe visually."
"okay. that sounds good. also, while you are waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be looking at it visually. okay. next item: your sps burn had no anomalies whatsoever. it was a very good burn."
okay. very good.
next item: request hydrogen tank i heater off for balancing purposes.
"and apollo 13, another item: something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a slight tce fluctuation on fuel cell 3. this fluctuation has been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37-second period. it has been seen on other flights in the past. no one is worried about it, but the usual fluctuation is about l-l/2 degrees instead of 7 seconds, so i thought you should be aware of it."
"okay, vance. and one other slight distinction we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3 either."
"okay. we copy. and the last item: we'd like to send you an irig update, so at your convenience, request po0 and accept."
"okay. we are in po0 and accept, vance."
okay.
"quad c and d are disabled, vance."
"roger. disabled. and down here, we see that your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are exactly matched, so we suspect it's purely a spacecraft read-out problem."
okay.
"okay, vance, let us know when you're through with the dsky so we can load noun 88?"
"roger. we'll let you know, jack."
"apollo lb, houston. the computer's yours, again."
okay. you're go for the pictures.
"okay, vance. we tried our auto optics and couldn't pick it up there. we're pointing pretty much right into the sun, and things are pretty well washed out. and i've gone to manual optics and i'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and trunnion, and i still can't pick it up. so - it's very light in the sextant, so i kind of think maybe we're too near the sun to see it."
"that's right, vance. the sextant is all - it's - it's all milky and it - any comet that could be seen through there is just going to be missed in the background."
"okay, we copy that. we got some discussion. stand by."
"okay, vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the sun - what we are getting is a large reflection from the sun behind us off the lm; and it is - it is coming on that quad i there, and that quad is reflecting back into the sextant."
"okay, jack. understand. just a question: if you look through the telescope, can you see the comet at all? over."
"no, i can't, vance. it's - it's still too light. tape 2/5"
stand by.
"say, vance?"
roger. go ahead.
are the flowers blooming yet?
"gee, i sure haven't seen any."
okay.
"hey, we've - we've got quite a discussion down here on your trying to observe the comet, and this reflection is not unexpected. and give us another minute, and we'll be back with you on something on that."
"okay. i doubt very seriously though, if we take any photographs with high-speed black and white with the light coming into the sextant that you're going to get anything out of it."
"okay. unanimous opinion is that you're right, and we'll scratch all of this bennett comet stuff on the way out, with the hope that conditions will be more favorable after tei. over."
"sounds good. without the lm, we may have a better chance."
roger.
"and apollo 13, you're go for ptc. tour rates are very low according to what we can read."
"roger, vance."
"okay. are you going to give a call on omni b, vance?"
"do you read, vance?"
"roger. go ahead. request 0mni b, fred, and secure the high-gain antenna."
okay. you got it.
okay.
"apollo 13, houston. tape 2/6"
"go ahead, houston."
"just something to think about. in about 30 minutes, we can generate the pads that we have yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could sup- port an earlier sleep period if you so desired. and - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff. the other thing is any time you're ready to copy, i can read up the solo book changes. over - and, also, two pages in the flight plan."
"okay, vance. we're about ready to copy the solo book changes and the flight plan changes, and whenever your pads are ready, we'll take those. and as far as moving up the sleep period, that's fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right away, we'll use it to get out some of our lunar maps and study them."
"okay. and we'll get busy getting those pads for you as soon as possible then, and i'll stand by on the copying bit."
"okay, vance, i'm ready to copy the solo book changes there. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay. first, turn to page 12. on the right-hand side of the page, starting from the middle of the page down, everything under ""cycle 5 frames, replace dark side or dark slide"" should be deleted until you get to the very bottom of the page where you have ""acquisition msfn omni d"" and that should remain in. also, leave in ""remove window shades ,"" which is about the third line down from where you start."
"okay. okay. then from ""cycle 5 frames, replace dark slide,"" from there on down, delete."
"that's everything from there on down, with the exception of ""remove window shades"" and at the bottom ""acquisition msfn 0mni d."""
okay. copy.
"and that includes in the margin to the left, the ""dap load"" that's at the _ery start there and the ""0.0507"" and ""plus 0500,"" farther down."
okay. got it.
okay. going to page 13.
okay.
"okay, in the left margin, just below 105 hours get, cross out the ""0507"" and the ""plus 0500,"" and below that, add in ""dap load"" as follows: ""10111 and lllll."""
okay. got it.
"okay. now, next, at about 105:05, there's a ""verb 48."" that should be moved up to 105, and below that, the ""verb 49 maneuver"" should be moved up, too."
"okay. that ""verb 48"" should be moved up to 105:05 and also the ""verb 49."""
that should be moved up to 105:00. i'm sorry. both.
okay.
and what that does is give you more time to maneuver.

"okay. go ahead, tk."
"yes, sir. understand you have a question."
yes. i guess i didn't understand what the letter and the number was behind some of these photo targets.
okay - -
does that refer to the pages?
"yes, sir. that's the map. each fold is lettered in the lower - or upper right-hand corner if you work your way from east to west and the charts are labeled d, e, and f and the solo stuff will all be the d and e, and they change with the plane change 1. that's the time they change the two maps."
okay. i got it. thank you.
"yes, sir. you're doing good work, hey."
"well, i had a good prime crewman that taught me all i know."

"hey, when fido gets a good hack on our trajectory, will you let us know?"
how long you willing to wait?
"he's looking at his calendar, if that means any- thing."
(laughter) all right.
"okay. i'm back at the attitude here, and i'll wait for rates to damps and you let me know when we're stable again."

"roger. i think i got it. i remembered a lot of it, and so i think with what you gave me and what i remember, i'm pretty sure we got it right."
"okay, and the third item, i was just about to call that your rates were stabilized to start the ptc, but it looks like they're jiggling around again from a dump, so we'll stand by some more."
okay. 01 09 52 23 imp no secrets around here.
"say again. hey, that's right. 01 09 52 33 imp i said there's no secrets around here."
yes. big brother is watching.

okay.
"okay, vance. we're po0 and accept. the computer' s yours."
roger. here it comes.
"you know, somehow, everytime i do a set of p23s, you guys uplink me a state vector. i don't think i do too well."
no - -
i could get a complex.
"no. you know - you know how the fidos are. they like to load in their own data, no matter what."
but our state vectors take into account the waste water dumps.
"yes, that's -"
"apollo 13, houston. it's your computer again."
okay. going to block.
"and as a matter of interest, understand that the downrange comparison between the mcc and the computer is within 35000 feet, and that's on the last sighting, which people think is pretty good."
"okay. maybe that gives us a little more confi- dence that if we had to do p23s on the way home, we'd make it."

okay.
"and, vance. has fido come up with any obser- vations on the trajectory?"
"well, a minute ago, he said that to tell you that he was pacified now after your past comments on his trajectory and so forth, and he hadn't seen any waste water dumps or anything and he's pretty happy."
okay. i just wondered if we're going to need any more mideourse.
"he says, seriously, it's looking probably like you won't have any more. g1 l0 59 45 cmp hey, that's real fine."
"fidos never guarantee anything, however."

"go ahead, vance. 01 1i 27 07 cc jim, just an item for you _md fred to be thinking about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's now being talked about a little bit. these conservative people would like to have you read the she tank pressure when you go into the lm for the lm familiarization at 58 hours. if there's no midcourse-3, and it looks like there's a good chance that there will not be, why, they might want to move the lm familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. over."
"okay. if we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll probably move lm fam up to 55 hours, in which case we'll go in there and read she tank pressure."
"roger. along with the other fam stuff, and it's not certain that we want to do this, it's just being talked about, so this is just the informa- tion for you."
okay. this is beginning to sound like the sim that we ran not too long ago.
i don't think it will be a very big deal.

"yes, it is pretty nice. not bad at all. you're right; you didn't say it. this ptc we're in is a pretty - pretty nice merry-go-round, vance. every l0 minutes alternately i get to look at the earth and the moon."
you couldn't ask for anything more than that. just so it isn't so fast you - -
"no, it's a lot - a lot better. i remember from 8 when they didn't hardly ever get to look at either one."
"that's right. they were tumbling about another axis, weren't they."
yes.
it's pretty cloudy down there tonight. about the only land i can see again is a portion of australia and korea and looks like a part of china. just about clouds covering everything else.
"can you still see that clearly with the naked eye, or do you have to look through a glass?"
"i can see australia with the naked eye and the china landmass, but i - it took the monocular to pull out the korean peninsula."

that's supposed to be just right.
yes.

"go ahead, jack."
"okay. we're into the presleep checklist now. as far as the crew status report, as far as medication goes, we've had no medication. and we're all feeling really good. i've given you the onboard readouts. jim is chlorinating the potable water now. i'm ready for an e-memory dump whenever you're ready."
"stand by 1 on the e-memory dump, jack. i think we'll be ready in about a minute."
okay.
"and eecomm says that as soon as you stir your cryos, request you go back to auto on that one tank."
okay. we'll do that.

i don't believe so unless we inadvertently hit the microphone button.
"must have been some other guy trying to call, jack."
"just trying to get some words in, eh jack?"
"roger. we saw the downvoice subperiod come on. we thought maybe you were trying to call. sorry. i hope we haven't disturbed you and from where i sit, it looks like you're running a rest home up there. good night."

it might be interesting that just after we went to sleep last night we had a master alarm and it really scared us. and we were all over the cockpit like a wet noodle.
(laughter) sorry it wasn't something more signif- icant. i've also got a procedure for you on that h2 tank; simple thing after you get done stirring up the cryos.

"okay. got it right here, jim, and it follows. this is the p37 pad for lift-off plus 60. the reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the mpl at 119 hours. it's the same one we passed you yesterday, and it's the same weather, but we still don't expect a problem at the end of the mission. geti is 060:00, delta-v t 6079, longitude minus 153, get 400k 118:04. over."
"geti of 060:00, 6079, minus 153, 118:04."
"roger. that's correct. i've got a consumables update for you, jim, if you're ready for that."
ready to copy.
"okay. as of 47 hours, rcs total 1096, quad alfa 270, bravo 278, charie 270, delta 278, and the h2 - - they gave me the h2s in percent, 76 per- cent; and on the 02 we have 81 percent. however, we show the 02 tank 2 reading off-scale high now. we're quite sure it's a sensor failture. we'd like you to verify it with your onboard reading."
okay. stand by.
"joe, we confirm. our gage reading is - on the number 2 02 tank is reading off-scale high now, but jack just tells me that it was okay when we first looked at it this morning."
"we verify that. at 46:115we had 82 percent and · apparently when he stirred the, the cryos, the sensor broke."
okay.
"so it's no problem. you're above nominal on all your consumables. on the h2 tank problem, we have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out which is simply turning the h2 tank 2 heaters to off at this time s and we want to see whether that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure setting off caution and warning. we want te look at it that way for a few hours."
okay. you want both h2 tank 2 heaters to off. is that correct?
that's negative; just tank 2. we want tank  to stay in auto.
okay. tank 2 heaters off at this time.
"okay. good deal. that's been the high tank and apparently while waiting for that pressure switch to close, to start the heater cycle, the tank i pressure has been dropping even a little bit lower and just setting off caution and warning, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2 heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle, we won't get into the ca_tion and warning range."
roger.
"oke_, jim. at your convenience we'd like po0 and accept. we're ready for - to upl_nk your state vector now since we will not do midcourse 3. over."
"roger. you're in po0 and accept, no midcourse 3, and we're all set for a state vector update and i'm giving you the lm/cm delta-p here shortly."
"okay. good deal. and i have flight plan updates for you later, at your convenience."
"houston, apollo 13. the lm/cm delta-p is 1.0 psi."
"copy, 1.0, jim."
"houston, apollo 13. i'm about ready for any flight plan updates that you have."
"okay, 13. to start off with, got a minor pro- cedural change for jack on his next p52, if he's ready to listen to th_:. 'age 124 o1 2_ h4 5_ cdr okay. jack's still off comm. we'll hold off on th:d, ,ct iittle bit and thou we'll pick it, up when 1)_' gct.s on comm,"
"okay; 1'nc. i've got two updates f'oryou, ,/:im. one is a procedure for looking for comet bennett at about 49:45, and i'll wait till jack gets up before passing you the details on that. the other update is concerned with going into the lm 3 hours early, and i think vance mentioned to you last night that this was a possibility, that we'd like to look at the she tank pressure early. and since we're not going to do midcourse 3, we'd like lm entry at 55 hours. is that okay with you?"
"okay. right, that's fine with us. we'll move up lm entry to 55 hours."
"okay. i've got some details on the flight plan for you as follows. of course, since there's no mcc-3 you'll be deleting all the midcourse 3 stuff including the - the p52, which is called out at about 54-1/2, and we'll be slipping that until later, which i'll - which i'll tell - which i'll tell - which i'll tell you in a minute. okay. then you - we want to move the battery charge up 3 hours to about 52:30. and we want to move the - moving the lm tunnel vent valve to lm/cm delta-p up b hours to 52:45, and at that point you can simply go to the 57-hour point in the flight plan and change your number from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that. in the remarks section at about 57:50 it says, ""0 fuel cell purge and waste water d_np,"" here. 2 if not performed earlier, we want you to do that at 54 hours and 50 minutes. the tv pass then, will be at 55 hours to 55:30. you'll go right through the lm activation checklist stuff. i'm losing you; let's wait a minute."
"13, houston. how do you read me?"
"13, houston. you back with us?"
"apollo 13, houston. are you back with us?"
we're back with you.
"okay. i've gone through the battery charge, the lm vent valve, the fuel cell purge, and then stop ptc at 55 hours, and your roll attitude there will be 285 degrees, which is per the flight plan. the high gain antenna angles are slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees. the tv pass till 55:30, the standard lm acti- vation except for some special steps we'll give you to take a look at she tank pressure, which i don't have yet. restart ptc at about 56:30 or whenever you're through with the _4 activ- ities, and after that, at your convenience, we'd like you to - to do the p52 option 3 that we cancelled at 54-1/2 hours. over."
okay. that last comment was that we'll do the p52 after we start ptc at about 56:30.
that's right. any time after that; it's not time critical.
"okay. let's see if i have some of this, joe. around 52:30 we're to do the battery charge on bat - battery b."
that's correct.
"and then about 52:40 we're going to do the lm tunnel vent valve, and the lm/cm delta-p which has been written up at 55:40."
that's correct.
we're deleting midcourse-3 and we've moved up the lm entry to 55 hours. so we'll merely follow all the - we'll follow all the procedures that leads up to lm entry that was originally scheduled for 58.
"that's correct. you can start at 57 in the flight plan; call it 54 hours and press right on. 01 23 5 48 cdr okay. then whenever we're finished with the lm, which we anticipate around 56:30, we'll commence ptc and sometime after that we'll do a p52."
that's affirmative. and did you copy the new high gain angles for 55 hours? the ones we had - -
"okay. we're going to stop the ptc for lm entry at roll 285, and high gain angles are pitch 23 and yaw 267."
"that's correct, j_m. and, 13, houston. the computer is yours."
"the computer is ours. we're in block, and exactly when do you want the tv to be cranked up?"
you can crank it up sometime prior to 55 hours at your convenience just to set it up. we'll be expecting transmission at 55 hours.
okay.
"and, houston, apollo 13. one thing i missed about the 02 fuel cell purge and waste and water dump."
roger. we'd like the the 02 fuel cell purge and waste water dump at 54:50.
roger. we'll pick up those items at 54:50.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"ail right, jack. one thing we'd like to have done sometime soon is to have you cycle the cryo fans in 02 tank 2 one more time. we'd like to see if we can get that sensor back. o1 23 54 50 cml okay. 02 tank 2 fan on now."
roger.
"houston, 13."
"go, 13."
"we - we have just one question, the lm tunnel vent valve. we're questioning why we're venting until the delta-v is greater than 1.7 if we are going to open up the tunnel, then pressurize the lm usually."
right. stand by on that.
"13, houston."
go ahead. tape 3/6 ?age 27
"roger. the word on that, jim, is that they want to insure the proper 02 concentration in the lm when you get to the surface, and this is a method of doing that by bleeding out additional nitrogen."
okay. thank you.
"and, 13, houston. if jack is up, i'd like to talk to him about the p52, briefly."
okay. he's here.
"go ahead, joe."
"okay, jack. what they'd like you to do on this p52 at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 0.2 of a degree plus or minus. before you come out of the optics zero position, at the start of this p52, they'd like you to just observe the shaft readout, and see if the jitter occurs on your direct readout there, and also they'd like you to briefly call up a verb 16, noun 91 so we can look at the shaft and trunnion angles."
"okay. let's see if i got it right. on the p52 at 49 hours, before coming out of zero on the optics, observe the shaft and also call up 16, 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion angles to observe a possible jitter. see whether it occurs in the zero position as well as out of zero."
"roger, jack. that's correct; and if you have time, now, i've got a flight plan update for you on looking for the comet bennett."
"okay. stand by 1, joe. and the commander's going off the air briefly."
roger that.
"_ okay, joe. i'm ready to copy the ... now."
"okay, jack. i'm going to read it to you, and then add some comments and we'll talk about it a little. this should occur sometime after 49:30. after the p52 realine at 49 hours, if time permits we would like the crew to investi- gate while in ptc if there is a roll angle in which the comet can be observed for photos. if there is, record the optimum roll angle for possible photography, prior to reinitiating ptc at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done in the lm, use p52 planet option, and the following half-unit vectors for tracking comet bennett at about 49:46. are you ready to copy half-unit vectors? over."
"okay. go ahead, joe."
"okay. ri plus 0.34202, r2 minus 0.07374, r3 plus 0.35719. read back."
"okay. copy ri plus 0.34202, r2 minus 0.07374, r3 plus 0.35719."
"okay. that's correct and the last sentence on the update is that you can expect aos of the comet at a roll of 45 degrees and los at a roll of 155 degrees. now, the deal here, jack, according to the plots they showed me is, the comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from the sun, and due to the geometry of the lm there shadowing the sun, it would appear that you will be able to see the comet through the sextant without getting sun shafting between roll angles of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. it appears that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees, although the comet is still in the field of view, the sun is also in the field of view, and you probably will not have any success between 75 and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75. if you do find that you can see the comet some- where between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note that roll angle and then if it's feasible we'd like you to photograph it after the lm entry part of the checklist. over."
"okay, joe. let me give it back to you and see if i've got it here. after the p52, during our ptc you want us to use p52 and observe bennett's comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if we can find it visible. it would be visible somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75 degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll, and if we do see it, make an observation of whether it is photographable, note the roll angle for photographs to be taken after or prior to initiation of ptc at 56:30. tape31/8"
"that's exactly right, jack."
okay. real fine.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"we're ready to have to 02 tank 2 fan off, and thank you."
"okay. doesn't look like we got it back, huh?"
"no, it doesn't, jack. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"houston, apollo 13."
"houston, apollo 13."
"hey, 13; houston. go ahead."
"okay, joe. i've started into p52 here. i've proceeded on option 3, and on the dis - 1520 - 1525 display, i've called up 1691. i'm going to let you observe and see while the - _he shaft angle while the optics are still in zero."
"okay. roger that, jack. we're looking at it, and i'll give you a mark as soon as g&c is happy."
okay. real fine.
"13_ tiouston. jack, could you give us a readout on your counter now?"
okay. i'm showing a shaft of 0.2 and a trunnion of 359.92.
roger. copy that. is there any jumping around on the shaft?
you mean on the tpac readout?
yes.
"as a matter of fact, it went from 0.2 to 0.21."
okay. copy that. stand by 1.
okay. now it went down - it went down as low as 0.15.
okay.
"jack, houston. let us watch that for another minute or so."
okay. i'm in no hurry. it looked like it burned between 0.14 and 0.8 with an occasional spike up to 0.2.
roger. i
"apollo 13, houston."
"apollo 13, houston. you can press on with p52 now. over."
"okay, joe."
"hey, houston, are we clear to torque? are you reading the torquing angles?"
"13, houston. go ahead and torque."
okay. time of torquing will be 49 hours 8 minutes 35 seconds.
roger that.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. for jack, we missed the star angle differ- ence on the p52. would you read us that?"
"roger, houston. it was all balls."
okay. thank you.
"hey, houston; 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"okay, joe. i got into p52 about 49:34. we loaded the planet - or bennett comet vectors into the planet option, and p52 tracked it all the way across except that it was always occulted by the lm, and we're in a roll angle of 155 now."
"roger. we're copying your roll angles. at what roll angle were you able to start tracking it, jack?"
"okay. at the time we entered it there, we were about 66 degrees roll, so either we started too late, or maybe somehow we got a wrong calculation on the roll angle."
"okay. let me have g&c comment on that. i sus- pect that the roll angles we gave you were calcu- lated for exactly 90 degrees pitch, and you're probably wobbling enough that they're not exactly correct. paf_e13__ 02 o 44 02 cl_' yo_,  thirjk yol_ - you pr_baby m,o, th_, rvht"
"13, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay, jack. notice you've secured from that, and that was going to be our recommendation, anyway. we're going to have the guys in the back room look at it and see if they can come up with some - with some better numbers based on the cone angle that - that you're traveling through, whether there are any roll angles that - that are available to you. and if there are, and we have time, we might give it another try; if not, we just will forget it."
okay.
"apollo 13, houston. over."
"go ahead, joe."
"okay, jack. i'd like to pass you a switch con- figuration on the cryo 02 tanks and give you the reason. right now, wetd like you to go to heaters tank 1, off; tank 2, auto, which is the opposite of the way you've got them now. over."
okay. is this 02 or h27
"this is 02, and stand by for a minute azldwe'll have a - excuse me. this is h2, jack; it's h2."
"... is auto, ... 2 off."
"okay, joe. do we have you back again?"
"okay, jack. we're getting you back, and i hope you copied my - my correction of my mistake. i'm talking about the h2 cryo tanks. we'd like the tank 1 heater to off; tank 2 to auto. over. 02 o1 50 09 cr_ okay. we lost you again. here's our heater configuration now. h2 heaters 1, off; 2, auto. both 02 heaters are in auto."
"okay. that's the configuration we want you in, and here's what we're thinking about. when we went to tank 1 auto, tank 2 off; we found that the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi, which is well above the caution and warning limit, and if we go to that configuration for sleep, we'll keep from getting caution and warning lights dltring the sleep cycle. okay. in order to do that comfortably, we want to spend the rest of the day using more h2 out of tank number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll all come out even. and that's why we have you in t_k 1 off, tank 2 auto, now. we expect to get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next 10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to reverse the configuration again. now the only disadwmtage here is that, during tile day, you will probably get a few caution and warnings, and we just figured it would be better to get them now than while you were sacked out. over."
i'll buy that 100 percent.
"okay. good deal. one other detail for you, jack; g&c tells us that the optics jitter is very similar to what we had on apollo 12. it's no problem, but when you're not using the optics, we recommend that you turn the optics power switch to off to guard against a possible degradation as the flight progresses. over."
okay. will do.
"okay. apollo 13, houston. i have one more little update for you, and it's another update to the erasable memory onboard crew charts on page g/9-2. over."
"houston, 13. we're ready to copy."
"okay, jim. these are gyro compensation terms. they've already been uplinked, and we're just updating your onboard charts now. in column a, number 11, change from 77646 to 00114; number 12, change from 77332 to 77546; number 13, change from 76617 to 77201. over."
"the changes are as follows, and all in column a: number 12, the new change is 77546; number 11, the new change is 00114; and 13, the new change is 77201. over."
roger. readback correct.
"and, joe, do you know - are you going to try and let us spot the bennett comet on this next revo- lution there? or do you want me to turn the optics power off now?"
"stand by 1, jack. okay, jack. we don't have confidence _n those roll angles yet, so why don't you turn the optics off, and we'll update you later."
okay. going off now.
"roger. apollo lb aii_-to-gi_oundvoici,_tianzcri?pion taf_e 33/i _ ,u .l)/j"
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"go ahead, houston."
"roger, jim. if you've got a couple of minutes now, i'd like to read up to you the change to the lm entry procedure that we'd like you to observe at 55 hours, and the rationale for it. over."
"okay, stand by."
roger.
"go ahead, joe."
"okay. before you start copying, this procedure is - is basically simply to activate the super- critical helium pressure gaging so that you can _ead it. and the concern here is lest this supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by 103 hours, at which point we'd be within a pos- sibility of rupturing the burst disk when you activate the dps. now, based on the pressure at launch, and based on a nominal rise time of about 6-1/2 psi per hour between then and now, the pres- sure should read about 710 psi. stand by, 13, until we get better comm."
"houston, you were cut out. would you say again about the helium pressure."
"roger. based on the prelaunch pressure in the she tank and the nominal rise time of about 6-1/2 psi per hour, the pressure should be about 710 at 55 hours. are you reading? over."
"jim, houston. did you read that last?"
"okay, joe. i 'm on omni c now. how do you read?"
"13, houston. you're loud and clear now. inco tells me he's having a little problem at goldstone and wants me to stand by for a minute."
"okay. how do you read now, joe? i'm going from omni c to d now. 'age 156"
"you're still loud and clear on - on d, fred. stand by 1. 02 02 _31 ill i_p okay. i'll put her back to omni b if you all want to take command again?"
"and the last thing we heard, joe, was that tile supercrit should be reading about 710 psi."
"okay. that's the last thing i passed up. and while we're waiting for inco to decide here, let me continue. the deadband that is considered acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi. in other words, any rise time that'll give you one - a pressure between those two, will keep you below the critical pressure at 103 hours or so. so, we expect it to read in that - in that band and if it does, there will be no problem. if it reads between 770 and 800 psi, we will want you to check the pressure again at about 59 hours, and i'll get the detailed procedures in a minute. if the pressure is equal to or greater than 800 psi, we're going to have to go into some more detailed procedures; we're going to try to - to get pcm data on it, for one thing. we may have to have you sit there and stare at the gage for a while to find out when it clicks up and get an accurate rise time on it, and then in extreme case, we are even thinking about a dps burn, but we don't really think that will happen. now, if you are ready to copy, what i have for you is a change or an addition to the lm activation check- list between pages tlc-1 and tlc-2, which consists of seven steps, and if you can find a blank side to write it down on, i would like to pass it up. over."
"okay. how do you read on omni c, now?"
"okay. you're loud and clesx on 0mni c. stand by 1 while we get inco synced up. 02 02 34 o0 lamp okay. the rest of your update was that it's okay if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. if it's above 770, you are going to ask us to con- sider going back in at 59 hours and either get pcm going or sit there and give you gage reading changes on the basis of that. and you said some- thing about an extreme measure. we may have to consider some sort of dps maneuver."
"that's correct, pred. we don't have procedures for that yet, and we don't have any real expecta- tion of getting into it. the procedure i'd like to read up to you now is simply the :;t_ps req_ir_d to get the supereritical helium pressure reading, at 55 hours. over."
okay.
"okay. we're calling this tlc-la, step 6, ""transfer to lm power."" 02 02 35 23 lamp all right. stand by 1, joe."
"okay. 02 02 35 3? cmp okay, joe. he's ready to copy."
"okay. step 6, ""transfer to lm power (floodlights blank), caution warning power caution light on. report get to mcc. panel 11, circuit breaker eps traeslunar bus tie, closed. circuit breaker panel 16, eps traeslunar bus tie, closed. cir- cuit breaker panel 11, lighting utility, closed. and activate utility lights."" over. and, 13, houston. select omni bravo, please. 02 02 37 08 lamp okay, joe. i'ye created a new page here called tlc-la, item 6, transfer to lm power and the usual check that the floodlight's blank and that i 'ye got the caution warning power light on; i get a get from jack, and i will pass that on down to you. item 7, circuit breaker eps translunar bus tie, panels ll and 16, closed. step 8, circuit breaker lighting and utility on panel 1, closed, and turn on the utility lights. however, the lighting is such that i don't really need those. they are in stowage, right now, i guess, in the isa, and i'll probably just leave them there."
"okay. that's optional. the way we had page tlc-la written, that was all part of step 6. you haven't even gotten to step 7 yet. step 7 is as follows."
"fred, houston. are you with me?"
"apollo 13, houston. are you reading me now?"
"okay. houston, 13. how do you read?"
"13, houston. loud and clear. what omni you ot_ now?"
"i'm going to stay omni b, if you all want to take command back and you can let inco jockey them around between b and d. and how many steps we got, so i know whether to write big or small here, joe?"
"okay. we got steps 6 through 12, but step 7 is the same size as 6, and 8 through 12 are short. they're only one line each."
okay.
"okay. step 7 follows: ""circuit breaker panel ll, ac bus b, helium pqgs propellant display, closed. circuit breaker ll, ac bus b, numeric lightii_g, closed. circuit breaker ll, ac bus b, bus tie inverter l, closed. circuit breaker panel ll, eps inverter l, closed. circuit breaker panel 16, instrumentation sig sensor, closed. inverter l"" - -"
"hold on a minute, joe."
okay.
my shorthand is rather poor today.
"okay i'm now up to circuit breaker panel ll, inverter 1, closed."
"okay. next was ""circuit breaker panel 16, instrumentation sig sensor, closed. then in- verter l, select. then helium monitor to super- crit press. report supercrit press to mcc."" over."
"houston, 13. how do you read?"
"13, houston. you're coming through. we still have some background noise. do you want to read back step 7? 02 02 44 53 i24p hello, houston; 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"okay, joe. the last thing i got was helium monitor to supercrit pressure."
"okay. the last part of step 7 is, ""report supercrit pressure to mcc,"" and read back step 7."
"okay. step 7. circuit breaker panel 11, ac bus b, helium pqgs display, closed. main - circuit breaker panel 11, ac bus b, numeric light- ing, closed. cd panel 11, ac bus - is that ac bus b? bus tie inverter 1, closed?"
that's affirmative.
"and cb - cb eps inverter 1, panel 11, closed. cb panel 16, instrument signal sensor, closed. inverter l, select. helium monitor to supercrit pressure. report pressure to msfn."
"okay. that's correct. now step 8 is, ""on mcc request, perform step 9."" in other words, you wait for us to decide what to do and that's according to the gouge we've already given you. and step 9, i'll give you now, is ""helium monitor to off, inverter to off."" over."
"okay. step 8 says, ""set in an mcc hold."" step 9 says, ""on mcc' s words, helium monitor off, in- verter off."""
"roger. that's correct. step l0 is, ""configure circuit breaker panels per activation 3 and 4."""
"okay. configure - step 10, ""configure circuit breakers per activation pages 3 and 4."""
"roger. that's correct. step 11 is, ""deactivate the utility lights if you activated them,"" and step 12 which is the last one is, ""transfer to csm power, usual observations, and report time to mcc."""
"okay. step ll, ""deactivate utility lights."" 12, ""transfer to csm power and note the usual observations and report the get."""
"okay. that's it. and, of course, houston will be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure is less than 770. if the pressure is between 770 and 800, we will be asking you to do the following, if you're ready to copy."
"stand by. i've got to find some more blank paper. 02 02 49 0 cc y_z. this i:;going to b, page tlc-is, jut it's very short."
"okay. go ahead with tlc-3. 02 02 _9 31 cc okay. stand by 10 seconds, fred."
"fred, houston."
ail right. go ahead.
"roger. we'll hold off on that. ii;was a short three-step procedure which said, ""repeat activa- tion pages 1, la, and 2, ""but there was another step in it that nobody understands. so, essen- tially what we'd recommend in that ease would be that you would repeat the procedure that we just passed up for reading the supercrit pressure. if we need to, we'll clarify it later on. and that's all we've got."
okay.
"houston, 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"okay. one thing, joe; i just want to doubleeheck again. all the stuff that normally was going to start at 57 hours, which the first item was pres- surize csm to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that up to 64 now, so we have our lm entry which was nominally at 58 at 55. is that correct?"
"that's correct, jim."
okay.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger, 13. because of the 02 tank 2 quantity sensor drop out, eecom wants to keep a little closer track of the cryo quantities, and he's going to be asking you to stir all the cryo tanks at slightly more frequent intervals than had been planned, and the first time is now, and we will be calling you probably every 5 or 6 hours, ex- cept during sleep period and high activity periods. we'd like you to do it now. over. ) 02 03 07 hh cdr okay. we'll start it ... now. 02 03 07 _6 cc thank you."
"and, lb, houston. for your information, a normal 1-minute or so stir will be fine. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, just an advisory; expect a caution and warning on h2 tank 1 pretty quick. no problems; just warning you about it."
"okay. a zero pressure light on h2 tank 1 coming on shortly, huh?"
right.
"okay. well, you're pretty close. it just came on."
any other predictions you'd like?
"well, there's - i guess there's all sorts. could you go to the horse races with me?"
i'm sorry; you were garbled. say again?
i said i'd like to invite you to the horse races with me.
"right. we'll - we'll send eecomm. 02 04 16 55 i34p well, it's time for a little grits again here, vance."
"understand. some grits, huh? chow. bon apetit."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
roger. just expect that same caution and warning to come on again. and you want us to keep warn- ing you of that thing?
"go ahead, houston."
"roger, jim. just expect a caution and warning to come on the same as it did about an hour ago."
"go ahead, houston. we've lost ..."
"roger. how are you reading me now, jim? '_ tape 3_/2_"
"houston, apollo 13. "
"13, houston. how do you read now? "
okay. read you good now. seems like we've had a little trouble with the comm today.
yes. i guess it's partly because you are further % out. we just wanted to tell you that you were % going to get that caution warning that you just  got.
right. we just got.
"and i won't bother you with those calls anymore, unless you especially want them."
"that's okay, vance. you don't have to call us about that, unless it's something serious."
okay.
we just ate a can of ham salad and that was an experience.
roger. copy.
it's really kind of like eating on the sly. chasing it around.
right. copy.
but good. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription o2 o5 19 28 sc ...
"houston, apollo 13."
"13, houston. go ahead."
"right, we're not doing anything right now, vm_ce, we're just getting curious, we could start the lm entry procedures, and get everything squared away, and then when the tv comes up at 55 hours, we can just use it for the tv, and we wouldn't be worrying about checking out the she tank pressures and everything like that."
"okay, let us mull that one a minute here, and i'll get right back with you."
okay.
"also, houston, apollo 13. we'd like to move up the waste water dump and maybe the 02 fuel cell purge a little bit early, if we could."
"okay, stand by."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, you're clear to go on into the lm, and just advise though that the tv time is still fixed at 55 hours, and - so we'll be standing by to support your entry and we'll get back with you on a minute - in a minute on the 02 fuel cell purge and the waste water dump."
okay. sounds good.
and also request your lm/cm delta-p which was on the flight plan for 53 hours. what did you vent it down to? over.
we have 1.7 now. we vented it down to that figure.
"okay, you vented down to 1.7, and what did it start at?"
"it was about 1.1, vance. tape 35/: _"
"roger, copy."
"houston, 13."
"go ahead, 13."
what do you read for suit pressure down there?
"we're reading 4.3, fred."
okay.
"houston, 13."
"go ahead, apollo 13."
"we'd like another confirmation, when we closed the tunnel vent valve back to lm/cm delta-p, we were reading about 1.7 - 1.75, and it slowly went up now to about - oh, i'd say a little less than 2.2. seems to be holding there - is there a lag in the gaging system?"
okay. we'll - we'll ask that question. stand by.
"apollo 13, houston."
"apollo 13, houston."
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, to answer your question, jim, that increase in pressure is normal, because it was just track- ing an increase in cabin pressure."
okay. okay.
we're not thinking today.
"and, 13, from houston, it's okay with us if you want to move the 02 fuel cell purge and the water dump up to this time. over."
okay. we'll work it in shortly. thank you.
right.
"apollo 13, houston. i':j,l?_ii 4(, 02 05 h5 16 cdr go ahead."
"jim, recommend you stay in the ptc until we stop it for the tv at 55 hours, in case you were thinking of - -"
"go ahead, houston."
roger. recommend you continue ptc until 55 hours. over.
"you were calling, houston?"
"that's affirmed, jim. how do you read now?"
okay. we read you loud and clear.
"okay. the only comment that we just made was that, in case you were thinking of stopping ptc, there's no need to stop it until 55 get when tv starts."
right. we'll stop it when we're setting up our tv.
roger.
"okay, houston, the waste water dump and 02 fuel cell purge are complete."
houston. roger.
"okay, houston, the lm/cm delta-p is constant. we're going to go ahead with hatch removal."
houston. roger.
"is that you, jack?"
"no, this is jack's replacement."
"okay, houston; 13."
"houston, go ahead."
"go ahead, 13."
"houston, apollo 13."
"this is houston. go ahead, 13. _'age147"
"okay, houston; apollo 13."
"roger. go ahead, 13."
okay. the lmp has entered the lm.
roger.
is that big john?
it sure is. how're you doing?
fine.
"yes, you're doing great, man."
thank you. i had a good cdr.
you're doing it on your own now.
"yes, it feels like i'm back at home, again, john, down in here."
"i hope you did a good job, john."
roger.
"okay, houston, we want to take the fm and bring up tv here for our own use. then we'll go to transmit i - at 55 hours."
"roger, 13. m_ollo lb aii_-'.i'o-gholini_ voicm ''i_an_ci_iption l_'ag_ j4l_"
"okay, houston, we've transferred to lm power; the time was 54 hours 46 minutes 15 seconds."
"roger, jack. transfer to lm power. thank you. 02 06 46 47 _ and the docking-tunnel index, jack, was minus 2 degrees."
"say again, fred, you're coming in with a lot of background noise."
okay. the docking-tunnel index mark was minus 2 degrees.
roger. minus 2 degrees.
"okay. jack, how do you read?"
"fred, houston is reading you loud and clear."
"okay. i've got up through step 7 now, and i'm not getting much of a light in the helium indi- cator here. why don't i review for you how we've proceeded, and you look at the procedure you gave me, and see if we've missed anything."
"roger. go ahead. 02 06 49 57 i/4p okay. we transferred to lm power and that looked okay. i'm staring at a caution and warning fotw_er light, and all the red flags; and we got both x lunar bus tie breakers in. the utility lighting breaker is in; then ac bus b helium pqs display; the ac bus b numeric lighting, and ac bus b inverter i is - bus tie is closed. then i closed the inverter i breaker, and i've selected, on panel 16, and the signal consensor sic breaker is in; i've selected inverter i and put the helium monitor switch to supercrit and i have no lights."
"okay, fred, let us take a look at it."
"i was wondering, do we need an a - do we need, possibly, in the - one of the anun/dock/ component breakers in?"
stand by 1.
"okay, jack. hold the phone. i forgot the rheo- stat was cranked all the way down on the anun/ num and it's showing 720, which looks like a pretty good - pretty good number."
"roger. we copy 720. thank you, fred - - 02 06 51 49 _ flashed to 7 - okay, and it just flickered down to 710. it's kind of flickering between 710 and 720."
roger. 710 to 720.
"okay, fred. those are good numbers, and we're not going to have to crank up the tm. that's the number we were looking for. 02 06 52 26 imp very good. okay. do you want me to back out of this in reverse at least as far as getting this part of it powered down?"
stand by 1.
"fred, this is houston. go ahead and back out of this little test and proceed."
roger.
okay. we're back on csm power. the time was 54 hours 58 minutes 50 seconds.
"roger, jack. 54:58:50. thank you."
"okay, houston, we'll try to pick you up on the high gain."
roger.
"and, 13, we're ready on the tv when you are."
"this is 13. say again, houston."
"13, we're ready on the tv when you are. any time."
"okay, sounds good. with you in a minute, we're just cranking up high gain now."
"okay, houston. how do you read us in the high gain?"
"we're hearing you 5 square, jim, how me?"
okay. you're coming through okay.
"as you were on that, jim. we don't have you on high gain yet. we're still looking at you."
"13, houston. in this attitude, we'd suggest pitch 5, yaw 237 on the high gain. over."
"pitch 5, yaw 237. roger."
"okay, jack. can you - can you read the high gain now?"
"affirmative, jack. we've got you on a high gain and it appears to us that we're in wide beam - wide beam width."
"yes. we can't get it to come down to narrow. we tried to switch to auto track or reacq, and it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. and pitch goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. i'm trying - we're fitting it manual now at the angles that you gave us, and i'll try and get you in medium and narrow beam widths picking it up manually here."
"roger, jack. meanwhile, we'll look at the situation you describe there."
okay. and it does it on both sets of servo electronic power.
"jack, what it looks like is that, when we hit 239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort of scan limit or something and drops off."
"roger, jack; thank you."
"okay, i'm trying you in wide or medium beam width now. 02 07 07 54 c_p can you pick up the tv in this condition here at all?"
"negative, jack. we'll have to have the narrow beam width."
"okay. can you give us, maybe, a slight maneuver?"
"jack, we'd like you to check two high gain circuit breakers down in panel 25. check your high gain group 2 and your high gain in the flight bus. over."
"okay. okay, jack, they're both in."
roger.
"lb, we've got an attitude suggestion for you. we suggest that you go to roll 285 and try pitch 90 and yaw 0. over."
okay.
"0kay, houston; apollo 13. i think we've got high gain locked up now. do you confirm?"
"we confirm that, jim, we've got you locked up on the high gain and narrow beam."
"okay, sounds good. we'll get the tv started right away."
roger.
"13, houston. we'd like to disable quads c and d; use alfa and bravo. over."
okay- -
"- - disable quads c and d. roger. 02 07 1_ 56 cc okay, 13. we've got fred-o on tv."
"roger, houston. what we plan to do for you today is start out in the space shipper sic odyssey, and take you on through from odyssey in through the tunnel into aquarius. and show you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and your tv operator is now resting on the center couch, looking at fred haise, whose head is now just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and his back is against the lower-equipment-bay optical area. and fred will now transport him- self into the tunnel, and into the spaceship aquarius. tap_, 36/_ ?_g_! 152"
"you know one thing i noted, jack, when i first came across here, that starting upright in the command module and heading down in aquarius, there's a little bit of an orientation change that, even though i'd been through it once in the water tank, it still pretty unusual. i find myself, now, standing with my head on the floor when i get down inside the lm."
"that's a great picture, jim. you got the light just right. 02 07 16 40 _ and one of the nice things, jack, particularly for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of moving around in here. it's, of course, as you know from working in the command module simulator, it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity as an aid. because you get - pretty confining, really, at one g, to move around very much in there, and it's quite easy in this environment. the lm, as you can see, it looked pretty clean, i found a couple of loose washers about it and the - a little plastic cap off the sequence camera had come loose and i found it lodged over by the ed panel. okay. right under jim, now, he's actually standing on a - what looks to be a can here. and, for the sake of all the people back there, housed inside this can is the - the lm ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see my hand resting on top of right now - the engine that we use to get off of the moon. immediately adjacent to the engine cover here, i have my hand on a white box now, which has been shown before. this happens to be jim's plss, or the backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for cooling while on the lunar surface. this device we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and possibly up to as much as 5 hours. right - right behind the plss, a couple of little square pack- ages i now have my hand on here, one here and one right below, are our opss, which are, in essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. these are - when we get ready to mount up and head outside, will be placed up on top of the plss."
"the second backpack is mounted down on the lm floor, i hope, positioned right between the two of us. i have my hand on it at this time. tape 36/(i pace 153"
"roger, fred. we see it. the picture's coming through real good, and your description is good. we see jim's got the camera oriented the way wa like to look at it. so, keep talking. 02 07 20 05 i24p okay. i guess everybody has pretty much envisioned the space program as being all a lot of exotic electronics, and, certainly, a lot of it is. but i thought i'd bring out a couple of items here in conjunction with the plss. after the first eva, you get a very accurate measure- ment of the amount of water that's left in the plsss. we're going to make use of this bag i'm showing now to collect the remaining water out of the plss and see just how much we really did have left, and hopefully, on future missions, to be able to extend safely the allowable time on these units even a little further. and, my other hand, i have the mechanism by which we determine just how much water we really have in this bag. and i guess this - an apt description for this device would be a fish scale. and you can see i'm weighing myself right now, and it says i weigh actually less than zero right now. guess its calibration isn't too good."
that'll be the day.
"i think even you'd weigh zero here, jack."
touche.
"houston, this is jim. since fred's been in the lunar module, and since he's the lunar module pilot, this is the first time that he's felt that he's been right-side up."
"roger, jim."
"i might tell you that we're looking at right now, that round bag that's just behind fred holds our vacuum hose; and when we get back inside the lm we'll hook the vacuum off our suits, and it's resting or it's attached to the hatch which will - we will open to go on to the lunar sur- face, and, of course, to come back in. the hatch which we have come to now is a round hatch, which is our docking hatch between the - between odyssey and aquarius."
"roger, and we see fred looking in the wicuum cleaner there now. 02 07 2b 22 _ okay, what i have out now, jack, is le_a, w_ has also been shown before. it's a head garment: for wearing out on the surface, and i - i'm bringing jim's out here to show a couple of mod_. one problem before is that the cast of characters down on the surface haven't been able to be dis- tinguished apart very well. so, not only jim's suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can see his levva also has a - a red stripe. and now you can see one other mod here too, jack, which i hadn't really seen myself before. i guess on 12, pete and a1 had commented about the - commented about having trouble with sun- light in the eyes, so on our lewas they put on a new center section which you can pull down and use sort of like a baseball cap."
"okay, jack. who fixed up our levvas?"
"how's the detail on this one, jack?"
"say again, fred."
"can you see any detail in this picture now, or am i blocking out too much of the sunlight?"
"that's affirmative. we've got a good picture of the lewa there, and it's coming through loud and clear."
okay.
"okay, jack, while fred is putting away my helmet, you are looking over into fred's station now. how's this picture, is it okay before - or do i have to adjust it?"
we have a hunch that the setting might be in peak but we recommend average on the alc if you haven't got it there already.
"we're in average, jack."
okay. and we're getting a good picture of the
"side with the deda over there. tap(! '_(__"""
"hey, jack, one question on the command module here. do i - i have the dap right now wide dead- band. do you want me to begin setting up nar deadband and nulling the rates to start ptc a"
"stand by, jack. 02 07 27 31 i24p what i'm fishing out now, jack, is another new piece of hardware that we are taking along this time as a result of some comments made on the apollo 12 flight."
"what fred is opening up - is a drink bag that we place inside of our neckring that will allow us to drink while we are on the lullar sur- face. they - pete and a1 - did not have that on apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very thirsty. but we hope to alleviate that situation by having our own little bag of water which, with very little effort, we can have a sip or two while we are looking around and doing our geology work. 02 07 28 33 imp so if you hear any funny noises, it is just probably the drink bag."
"fred, the bag's empty."
"fred is now looking through our optical device. it's an instrument in which to aline our plat- form, and fred is now looking into it just to see what kind of an outside picture he might be able to get. we might be able to use a tv camera to look through our optical instrumen to the outside of the command module. a few minutes ago while we first came in, we did manage to look to the outside of the side hatch of the command module through our optical instru- ment. stand by. we'll try to see what we can do here."
"roger, jim. break, jack, we'd like you to stay in the deadband you are now in, and we'll make a change when the tv is over. another thing we would like you to do is check your pitch and yaw on your high gain meter so we can compare it with what we're seeing down here."
"okay, it's showing about - say 28 degrees and 267. pa_e  '-il"
20 and 267.
28 - 28 and 267.
"okay, jack, laveyou got that pieturo now?"
"fred, about one-quarter of our screen is light:,,d. and it's impossible to determine what you are looking at right now. maybe you could give us a little verbal description."
"okay. it's looking through the aot in position 4, right rear. and we're looking back toward the - over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module."
"okay. is - is it too dark a picture, jack? you think the f-stop open may help?"
"no, fred, it's got to be centered up a little bit. that's primarily what you have to do."
"jack, we can't center it up any more, because the side hatch is only one part of the aot. the rest of that blackness you see is really space."
"okay. we'll try another one, and it's a little better centered. in fact, the only other one we have that shows the whole picture. we're in the forward d-10 of the aot now, position 2, and you should be seeing something familiar like a radar antenna."
"okay, we see you moving the camera up to the a_!' lens, and we got a real good picture now."
and -
"okay, jack, i'm looking out the right window now, and not too far off in the distance now, you can see the objective, and i'll zoom in on it here a little and see if it brings it in better."
"and it's actually beginning to look a little bigger now. you can see quite distinctly some of the features with the naked eye. and so far, i guess i have to even agree with jim that it's still looking pretty gray with white spots."
"okay, fred. we're getting a good picture of your destination there."
"jack, you've been looking at the - at fred'_ workshop now, and you can see the abort guidance computer. and over there on the - tucked away in his armrest, is our activation checklist, which we'll be using very shortly. up on the top of the window, we have our camera already mounted ready for photographing the descent. and now fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, i fotmd out on this flight so far."
"he's not in the food locker, is he?"
that's his second favorite pastime. he's rigging his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now to find out - to see what it's going to be like.
roger. sleeping and then eating.
"it's kind of difficult here, jack, getting into a h_w_ock in zero g. i'm not sure if i keep floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me."
"if you notice a few things floating around, we found just about one or two washers occasionally."
"and for the benefit of those that may wonder where jim sleeps. be a little difficult to rig his h_mmock in here right now with the hatch open, but his runs laterally in this direction, fore aft. so he has the upper berth and i get the lower berth."
"and now while fred's taking his hammock down arid restowing it, i might give you some idea of what sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no up or down, and i'm situated on top of the ascent engine just at the entrance to the tunnel. i'll reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from fred, look through the tunnel again back at odyssey, and we might pick up part of jack."
there he is. we see him.
"okay, houston. for the benefit of the television viewers, we've just about completed our little inspection of aquarius, and now we're proceeding through the hatchy-gap into the tunnel and going back toward the odyssey."
"okay, jim. it's been a great show so far."
"and fin,q.l_y, jack""_ (% m(, ha(;k iut_ ,i,, (idy::::_kv a,; we s.l. id_' on through th_, tmmc.i, h,,_'c.."
"houston, 13. are you still on tv?"
"yes, we sure are. we've got a good picture of the skipper there."
"okay. what we can show you now, a little added benefit, we've got the drogue on fred's couch in the command module right now. we stowed it temporarily while we're checking out the - out aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the probes stowed. quite a big cumbersome device, and we'll get a shot of it for you."
"you're looking now at our probe, the place on the nose of odyssey. it's a very heavy thing but i suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing, and it's much easier to move around. as a matter of fact, both fred and jack commented, as many people in the past have, of how much bigger the spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have such ease in moving compared to our simulator which make training rather difficult."
"okay. we're seeing a good picture of the probe there, jim, and looks like the characters shaved before the show this time."
"well, fred said he had to keep up his tv image."
"yes. that may be my first and last time though, jack."
it took fred i hour to shave.
"we might give you a quick - a quick shot of our entertainment on board the spacecraft, which has been keeping us company for some time. 02 07 43 57 (music - willow weep for me)"
"this little tape recorder has been a big benefit - has been a big benefit to us in pass- ing some of our time away on our transit to the moon, and it's rather odd to see it floating like this in odyssey while it's playing the theme from ""2001."" and, of course, the tapes wouldn't be complete without ""aquarius."""
"okay, jim. we're seeing the tape record_,r now, and just - by the way, how long do you l,xpect to keep the tv on this evening?"
"well, when we - stand by 1."
"yes, i got them with the cabin repress valve again there, jack."
"every time he does that our hearts - our hearts jump in our mouth. and, jack, any time you want to terminate tv, we're all set to go."
"okay, jim. it's been a real good tv show. we think we ought to conclude it from here now. what do you think?"
"roger. sounds good. and this is the crew of apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our in- spection of aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in odyssey. good night."
"thank you, 13."
"apollo 13, houston. the next thing we'd like you to do is to -"
go ahead.
"- - we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the comet bennett. to do that, we would like you to enable quads c and d. for the maneuver, use all your quads. and in precisely i minute, we'd like you to ter- minate the battery charge on battery b. one other request, we'd like to have you verify - -"
okay. will do.
"one other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. we'd like to know what track mode, what serv0, and what beam width."
"okay, jack, during the tv, we were auto track, narrow beam width, and the primary electronics. and we had a good loekup. just after we started the maneuver, i was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90. tap,_ _6/if,"
"roger. we copy, and the tv show was great."
"okay, real fine. okay, i'm going to maneuver to 060, 090, and 0. _ 02 07 50 31 cc and, 13, we'd like you to check c-4 thruster. ""_ '_ 02 07 51 33 cmp okay, jack. the battery charge has been ter-"

"this is houston. say again, please."
"houston, we've had a problem. we've had a ,_ main b bus undervolt."
roger. main b undervolt.
"okay, stand by, 13. we're looking at it."
"okay. right now, houston, the voltage is - is looking good. and we had a pretty large bang associated with the caution and warning there. and as i recall, main b was the one that had had au amp spike on it once before."
"roger, fred."
"in the interim here, we're starting to go ahead and button up the tunnel again."
roger.
yes. that jolt must have rocked the sensor on - see now - 02 quantity 2. it - was oscillating down around 20 to 60 percent. now it's full- scale high again.
roger.
"and, houston, we had a restart on our computer and we had a pgncs light and the restart resf.."
"roger. restart and a pgncs light. res_ on a pgncs, reset - -"
"okay. and we're looking at our s - service module rcs helium 1. we have - b is barber poled and d is barber poled, helium 2, d is barber pole, and secondary propellants, i have a and c barber pole. bmag temperatures?"
"okay, ac 2 is showing zip. i'm going to try to reconfigure on that, jack."
roger.
"yes. we got a main bus a undervolt now, too, showing."
main a undervolt.
"it's reading about 25-1/2, main b is reading zip right now."
"and, houston, odyssey."
"stand by l, jim."
"13, houston. we'd like you to attempt to recon- nect fuel cell i to main a and fuel cell 3 to main b. verify that quad delta is open."
"okay, houston. i'm showing - i tried to reset and fuel cell i and 3 are both showing gray flags, but they are both showing zip on the flows."
we copy.
"okay, houston. are you still reading 137 pago 69"
"that's affirmatiw-. we're readin_ you. we're, trying to como up with :_, go_l ido:m hr'pc i',t' you."
"okay. let me give you some reading ... i n t_,, interim to help main a voltage, jack. i've go,. bus tie ac on."
"say again, fred."
"in the interim, to help out main a voltage, i've got main bus tie bat ac on. or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on main a?"
okay. bus tie ac on.
"13, houston. we need omni charlie, please."
you got it.
"13, houston. we'd like you to verify couple of readings for us. we would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1. we need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2."
okay. nitrogen on 1 and oxygen on 2. is that correct ?
negative. oxygen on 3.
okay.
okay. the systems test 1-a says zip.
"and 2 baker, which is 3 oxygen, says 0.6."
"2 baker says 0.6, and say again the other one."
fuel cell 1 nitrogen reads zero.
roger. zero.
"13, houston. we'd like you to open circuit fuel cell l; leave 2 and 3 as is."
okay. i'll get to work on that.
"and, jack, our 02 quantity number 2 tank is reading zero. did you get that?"
02 quantity number 2 is zero. )
"that's ac, okay. yes, that's good ac and it looks to me, looking out the hatch, that we are venting something. we are venting something out into the - into space."
roger. we copy your venting.
it's a gas of some sort.

we just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel cell 1.
okay. she's off the line.
"13, houston. we see you getting close to gimbal lock there. we'd like you to bring up all quad cs on main a, quad c-l, c-2, c-3, c-4 on main a, and also bring b-3 and b-4 up on main a."
"13, houston. do you read?"
yes. we got it.
affirm.

roger. we copy bmag 2 in warm up. we'll follow you through. tape y_/2
"okay, and something is giving us a reach, jack, both in pitch and roll, so i'm suspecting that maybe it's whatever it is that's venting back there. i've had to use direct in order to stabilize this, and as soon as i do, we're starting to pick up rates again. can you pick up any jets firing?"
"stand by. what direction are your rates in, jack?"
it's negative pitch and negative roll.
roger.

"get the get; we need the get. w_,at is it? ;;,_,at's that? 58? 58:07?"
58 what?
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"here are the gimbal angles. command module, 356.69, 163.42, 346.67. aquarius is 302.26, 345.92, 011.79. over."
"okay, jim. i got command module 356.65, 163.42, 346.67. aquarius, 302.26, 345.92, 011.78."
that's 011.79.
"say again, please."
the lm middle gimbal is 011.79.
011.79. got it.
houston .... flashing.
"odyssey, houston. we need a command reset on your - on your comm, and then we'd like you to power down to cmc, power down the imu, heaters off on the imu, but leave the battery a on."
yes.
"odyssey, houston."
ask him if he's ...
yes.
are you ...?
yes.
"houston, this is odyssey. go ahead."
"okay, jim - -"
"copy it down. tap_' 30/1 i'ag,'it%',"
"okay, jim. i think i'm reading jack, now. ut what we want him to do is to give us a command reset. and then power down the cmc, power down the imu, turn the imu heater off, leave battery a on. over."
"that's just about 80 - in fact, 82 hours out of the two primary cartridges. that's two guys. _4 is what lc8 got. that would be 88 hours. we got a secc_ldary. you're right. we're listening."
"odyssey, houston."
they can stand it - go ahead?
"yes, jack. did you copy down about the cmc imu?"
"yes, jack. i read it back twice to you. command reset, which i've done. i'm about to power down the imu, power down the cmc, turn the imu heaters off, leave bat a on."
that's affirm. thank you.
"okay. i just got a master alarm and main bus a undervolt. and i'm starting to power down, now. - -"
"we've lost - the only advantage to doing it early; if we can power back - the lm back down. the only advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn now and a midcourse and then power the lm down. otherwise, we got to keep the lm powered up clear until we get around the moon. plus it would be inside on the burn. i just hope the g&n hangs up on - hangs in on this one - i'd sure hate to do that one manual."
oh boy.
"odyssey, houston. couple circuit breakers for you. on panel 276, on our instrumentation power control, open cb number 3 and number 4."
"okay, houston. panel 276, instrumentation out and reset - -"
- - a lot of light.
- - cb-3 and cb-_ are open.
"what? 02 ii0 16 47 cc that's affirmative, odyssey. _md also get your scs electronics package and power off, and your fdai power/gpi off, and your auto jet select, all 16 off."
"okay. well, wait a second. let me - let me get the cmc power down."
"roger, jack."
"i wonder how much that's going to bring this up, here. 02 l0 17 2b cdr jack, while he's doing that, copy down what you just said again. i want to write it down."
"aquarius, we need to get your sublimator powered up, activation page 20 and activation page 21, step 3. over."
"roger. activation page 20 and activation page 21, step 3, sublimator."
roger.
"that's activation, page 20? okay, jack. now i have to power down imu. i have no control at all. i'm going to turn my 16 jets off, say again the other things you wanted?"
"okay, jack. we'd like you to turn off your 02 tank 2 heaters and fans. correction - tank 1. turn the fans and heaters off."
"okay. and, jack, can we turn on the fdai circuit breakers so we could have a ball to see if we go to gimbal lock or not?"
stand by.
"houston, he's going to give a 16 noun 20, jack. and, okay, i've got 02 heaters and fans off in tank 1."
"and, jack, let me know if you get close to gimbal lock, would you?"
"jim, we don't want you to power down the ball in the lm. we wanted you to power down the ball in the csm."
"jack, thcy haven't powered down - -"
"jack, we don't have the balls powered up in the lm."
i have the cmc and imu in the command module is powered down. the heaters are out.
"and the evap flow valve, that's open now, and i've undone my suit hoses here and opened up the suit flow valves; so, we got air flowing in the lm now."
"okay, jack. will you say again the scs items you wanted me to power down?"
"okay, houston. do you read odyssey?"
"hello, houston. how do you read?"
"his gimbal lock and ours are different, jim."
"apollo 13, houston. say again, please. you were cut out."
"okay, jack. do you want me to proceed by the scs powerdown checklist? i did not copy the scs items you wanted me to power down."
"okay, odyssey. we want to go scs electronics power, off."
okay. it's done.
"fdai power/gpi, off. auto jet select, 16 - -"
that's done.
"- - off. and all your rotational control power, off."
"it's done. rotation control power, direct, and auto ..., off."
"okay, jack. tell me there. we need to know when we're getting close to gimbal lock in the lm. we have no balls right now."
okay. we want you to power up your eight-ball. we want you to get your rcs heaters on. pres- surize the rcs and open up the main sovs. over.
"okay, jack. i got two commander fdai breakers in, ac and dc, and the two gasta breakers in ac and dc and next you'll want the rcs heaters all on with the - pressurize the rcs and then the main sovs open. and i think they're already open."
"roger. and, fred-o, get the tca breakers in last. please."
"roger, jim. i'm holding open those until you give me a further word anyway. i'm just going to pressurize right now."
"jack, are you reading lm gimbal angles?"
"- - ... power off, come down here and ... the audio ..."
"okay, aquarius. i have some gyro torquing angles and the odyssey is powered down, attitude-control- wise, so lm's got attitude control now."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, jack."
okay. we want you to know that we got some gyro torquing angles for you. and we want you to tell us when you got attitude control in the lm.
"okay. we're still working on the pressurization. i'm getting jim on the horn here so he can help out, there."
roger.
wonder why.
we got to get this pressurized.
"houston, aquarius."
"stand by l, aquarius, odyssey. we'd like you to go direct rcs and hold your present attitude out the window until the lm gets rcs powered up. go ahead, jim."
"well, that's my question. we're not - our 16 20 doesn't match our eight-ball here. we went to fdais on, and we don't have our balls completely powered up. there may be a ... and our angles don't look the same and we don't want to go into gimbal lock. tap_' 3!_/l pag_ 18c_"
roger. how far are you from rcs power u_ - _cs pressurization?
"okay, jack. i'm right up to where it's _i&ster arm, on; rcs, fire; - -"
...
- - both logic powers out ... goes into normal circuit-bresker .... do you want a in and then i'll fire them?
"okay, 13. you're both talking at once. one at a time, please."
okay. who's first?
"close logic power a and b, fred, and pressurize rcs."
okay.
"go ahead, odyssey."
okay. i'm going to try to do the best i can. i've got a one-attitude reference i'm going to fly according to the lunar terminator.
"roger, jack. just maintain attitude."
"what am i doing? i can't do that, anyway. let's see, cross feed. nope. now, and-"
"aquarius, houston. we'll have to get some ac up so you can get a ball reading. close your bus tie inverter circuit breakers, all four of them on panel ll. close your ac bus volt circuit breaker on panel ll. on panel 16, inverter 2, close. select inverter 2. over."
"that's been completed, jack. 02 10 29 58 _ okay. the rcs is pressurized now."
"okay, jack. do you want us to proceed right on down the line with the rcs check-out and activa- tion 37 now?"
"stand by, fred."
"hell, is he still firing up there? tape 39/.18"
"okay, fred. ncgatlvc on thc actiw_tion _n_, pa_,, _ it- go on to your rc; pressurize and then g_-t your tca breakers in and go to pgns attitude hold. 02 10 b1 53 cdr okay, jack. how do you read? 02 l0 b1 56 cc okay, jim. this is houston. we want you to load the dap with 30120."
load the dap with b0120. complete.
okay. we need to change that csm weight.
"okay, aquarius. your csm weight is 63400."
and jack's alive to take control the lm to stay away from gimbal lock. over.
affirmative. take control of the lm. pgns attitude hold.
we are.
"and, odyssey, request you coordinate with aquarius on attitude control."
okay.
roger.
okay. i don't see where you're firing these things ...
oh?
are you firing anything?
i don't think so.
okay. i got direct.
"and, aquarius, check you atca (pgns) breaker on panel ll in."
say again.
"close, on panel ll, circuit breaker atca (pgns)."
atca (pgns). come on. let's take it easy now.
"okay. we've got atca (pgns) closed. _ag_,9  02 10 34 31 ls_ yes."
is that okay?
yes.
okay. now i'm looking.
... okay ...
how about plus?
no ....
okay. it's already open.
okay. slow down.
"okay, jack. we got it."
yes.
"okay, jim. how's the attitude control?"
"okay, jack. we've got attitude control now in the lm. we're going to try to rotate up through the bellyband."
roger.
i like that sound like i got back there.
"odyssey, houston. i've got a procedure for you."
"okay, jack. i'm ..."
"i want to go up this way to get away from that - the radios are powered, huh?"
yes.
check your antenna?
"okay, jack. odyssey is ready to copy."
"okay, jack. what we want you to do is close the reactants valve on fuel cell 2. power down your inverters. power down your battery relay bus. battery ties, off, and pull your entry circuit breakers, entry battery circuit breakers a, b, and c. tape 39/;'0"
"check the control, and make sure we don't go to gimbal lock, fred."
"okay, jack; understand. close reac valve circuit breakers in fuel cell 2. power down inverters. power down bat relay bus. bat ties, off. power entry and both running circuit breakers a, b, and c. all off."
"that's affirmative, jack. and close the reactant valve on fuel cell 2, there. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay. i'll do that, and jack'll do that other."
"okay, jack; on fuel cell 2, open circuit it."
okay. fuel cell 2 is open circuited. do you want me to go through the standard shutdown pro- cedure for the reac valves and -
"odyssey, houston. all you have to do is close the reacs valve on fuel cell 2."
okay. cb reacs and vent reac valves all closed.
yes.
yes.
... an hour and a half.
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. odyssey is completely powered down, ac- cording to the procedure that you read to jack."
"roger; we copy. that's where we want to be, jim."
"and, jack, have you all got good lm data down there now?"
"that's affirmative, fred. we're getting good lm data."
"okay. in that case, i think i '11 pull out some display breakers and just let you all keep sa eye on things."
roger.
"he's turning his lights off now, too."
"stand by 1 on that, fred."
okay.
what about these lights up here? 02 i0 41 30 lmp i've got it.
okay.
where would you like ...?
...
oh.
we don't want to lose comm with him.
i'm watching it.
"aquarius, houston. stand by on opening your circuit breakers for displays. we're going to let you know what they are, and i have some gyro torquing angles for you."
okay. what page is that there gyro torquing?
"okay. what page is the, do we write the gyro torquing angles on there, jack?"
stand by.
"okay. we're there now, jim. jim's got it. go ahead with the gyro torquing angles."
"okay. we'd like you to proceed with the fine aline and your gyro torquing angles are x plus 003.30, y plus 024.80, z minus 015.10. over."
"okay. i read your gyro torquing angles as plus 003.30, y is plus 023, i only have four numbers for y; you'll have to give that one to me again, and z is minus 015.10. read y again, pleas e."
"okay, jim. x and z are correct and y is plus 024.80."
okay. we read y as plus 024.80. we'll proceed on activation 40 to fine aline the platform.
"roger. okay, aquarius, proceed as on page 40 with imu fine aline."
"aquarius, houston. can you see any stars out the lm window? 02 !0 47 53 lmp we'll have to wipe them off, jack. they're coated with water right now."
can i get a towel?
yes.
"roger. as soon as you get a chance to - on your position - to take a look, we'd like to know if you can see stars for alinement purposes."
okay. jim's going to be in trouble in our present attitude out his side. the sun's there.
wait 1. 02 10 48 29 _ what have you got? how much you got left in battery a? okay. i wish i knew what the hell they were thinking right not ... - -
they're talking about powering down and doing a p51 here?
no. they were just thinking about p52 - -
"aquarius, houston. negative on the p51. we want to stay just like we are, but we'd like to be able to correlate what you're doing with some simulator work we're going to crank up. and so if you can give us information as to what stars you can see out the window, we can make that correlation."
would you say one more time? give me the top two. the top two.
"jim, what we want you to do is go with your cur- rent fine aline and disregard the p51. what we're attempting to do is to crank up some lms simula- tions to correlate what we can get out your window with what we can get out the lmb window to see if that will help us any. so when you can see some stars, if you can, you think you can recognize them and recognize constellations, please let us know."
okay. we'll check. stand by.
okay. watch the - -
"i'm just glad ... 02 i0 51 25 cdr okay, stand by."
"okay. here, unplug this."
"aquarius, liouston. we notice that the 02 pres- sure in the ascent tank 02 is a little high, so we want to use some of it. so close descent o_ and open ascent 02, tank 2. over."
"okay, jack. switch now on ascent number 2 02 tank, descent 02 is closed."
"roger, fred."
... that?
"okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read?"
"reading you 5 square, jim. go ahead."
"okay. i'm looking out of fred's window. i see a lot of particles out there, but a lot of that stuff is still drifting away from us, so a lot of it is flashing in the local vicinity, and i dca't recognize any constellations right now, in this particular attitude."
"okay, jim. if that status changes, please let us know."
"roger. we're continuing to drift. okay, get your ttcas to roll."
ttca ...
"and, aquarius; houston. i've got some circuit breakers you can open to power down displays. in addition, i have a p30 maneuver pad. over."
"roger. stand by, houston. get the cs - get the pad book."
get the lm data - get the lm book.
"and, say - we're getting the pad book now, jack - and say the boost on powered up?"
okay. i have .';omccircuit breakers that you can op_n up in order to power d_n displays.
"okay. stand by 1, jack. i'm going to get my comm carrier on."
"all right, i'll tell you what. get all the lm stuff. give me the lm stuff right now. jack, give me all the lm stuff."
why?
"all right, jack. hey, what do you need out of here ?"
... status.
here.
now is there any way they can control this thing with the lm on? fred-o?
what's that?
looks like i'm cross-coupling here. i might as well -
"yes, you are. ttca will give you the best con- trolling warning."
"yes, and i want to get out of this roll. what if i go to - -"
it doesn't matter where the hell you are .... gimbal lock ... my flashlight or any flashlight.
... down and power down ...
"well, i'm not doing any good here."
"okay, how do you read now, jack?"
0mni.
"yes, we're on."
"hello, houston; aquarius."
back on? yes.
"aquarius, houston. you're watching the middle gimbal there, aren't you? go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. go ahead with the breakers first, jack."
okay. you watching your middle gimbal there?
tell them we are.
"your attitude is just straight pitch down, jim. okay, you 're moving away."
"okay, fred, i've got six circuit breakers for you."
okay. go ahead.
"okay, they're all on panel 11. row 1 under ac bus b, open helium pqgs for propellant display."
it's open.
"on row 2, flight displays, open thrust, open mission timer, open range/range rate, altitude/ altitude rate, and open the ac bus a range rate, altitude/altitude rate."
they're open.
okay. they're all open.
"okay. on row 4, pgns, signal strength display."
it's open.
it's open?
okay. that concludes the powerdown of displays. and i have a ps0 pad for you.
okay. go ahead.
"okay. the purpose is a pericynthion plus 2 hours dps abort. noun 33: 079:25:26.48; plus 1633.0, minus 0014.5, minus 0751.5; apogee not applicable, perigee is plus 0020.5; 1797.7, 8:b5, 268, 264, plus 16410, minus 00145, minus 07338. coas is na. and i have two gimbal trim angles for you which will be updated. right now, however, we want you to go with pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. over."
what was that for?
"pitch and yaw, maybe, huh?"
"okay, what was the last two things you gave me, a pitch and roll angle for what?"
that's for your dps trim.
those were gimbal angles for - pitch and yaw.
"oh, roger. gdas."
"yes, that's what i mean. sorry. 02 11 03 58 _ pericynthion plus 2 - okay, dps pericynthion plus 2, at 079:25:026.48; plus 1633.0, minus 0014.5, minus 0751.5; ha n slash a, hp plus 0020.5; 1797.7, 8:35, 268, 264, plus 16410, minus 00145, minus 07338 - -"
did we lose the water in the - -
"- - n slash a in the coas, and you gave me gda angles of pitch 5.86, and you want roll 6.75."
"good readback, fred."
"yes, lose - get all the little bags you can with water."
"aquarius, houston. say again, please."
"okay. we didn't answer back there, jack. check to see if you're on vox."
no.
"neither am i, okay. why the hell are we maneuver- ing at all now? are we still venting?"
"well, we're at att hold for one thing - i mean, we're at minimum impulse."
"no, i mean why can't you null them out, somewhere?"
every time i try to - i can't take that doggone roll out. i got to wait until they get around to the bellyband.
wait a minute. do you - you fight roll by using the ttca left right. that's what you need to play with.
okay. we'll try that. let me get around though. let's roll. let it roll all the way. tap_ _0/8 pagl_ 200
"yes, you can't let it roll all the way."
i know. i know. but i mean -
"okay. then until it's upside down at least, huh?"
yes.
"okay. well, should i ask him what the return time on that one is? or are you interested?"
let's get the first things first.
"oh, you don't want to hear. let me figure some times out here. that's at 79, and what are we at now? about - do we - do we - do we even know any better computer time, do we?"
no.
"hey, jack. do you still have a mission timer? you don't? okay."
"i'll tell you what. let's ask - let's ask houston to give us a mission timer, computer time. they can up link it to us. okay, hold it."
go ahead.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"you know, we don't have a - i don't think we have a computer clock going, and why don't you up link that stuff to us?"
roger.
"and, fred-o, i got some fast circuit breakers on panel 16 for you."
okay. go ahead.
"okay. on row i under flight displays, systen_s engineer 's crosspointer, open. under rcs b - -"
it's open.
"open the temp/press display-flags and pqgs/displays. tape 1,0/9 02 11 08 10 _j okay. 'l'h_.y'r_b.oth open."
"okay, fred. on row 3 under comm, open displays and under ecs, open displays."
"okay. comm displays, ecs displays, both open."
"okay. and two more. in row 4 under heaters, open displays and under eps, open displays."
"okay. heaters display, eps display open. and i've long since had all the lights off, floods, et cetera."
where are those bags? where are those bags for weighing water in the plss?
why?
we're going to fill up command module water. we'll ...
"hell, do you need a qd *** jim. no way to get ours in there. i don't think."
"hey, jim."
"i wonder if one of our water ... jet is. okay, let's control - what else can we fill up there?"
"aquarius, houston."
we're not - we're not going to - -
"we're not going to be able to up link your time because of the iu, and we have a frequency problem there. but what i'd like to do is give you a time to set up on your mission timer and give you a mark and then you can put it into the dsky from there. over."
okay. stand by.
"wait a minute. why do we need a mission timer right now, anyway? i mean, that bad, they'd tell us."
"well, i'd rather have a timer going so that we - what are we going to put in the dsky? should we shut down the mission timer? 02 11 10 37 i2_p is that what you want to do?"
"yes. hey, omni. 02 11 10 43 _ great."
switch them. okay. let's fire on the mission timer.
"aquarius, we need forward 0mni."
forward omni.
"say again, jack."
forward omni.
"i am. okay, houston. if that call was an omni switch, i 'm in forward now."
"okay, fred-o, how do i get the mission timer up? i got the mission timer cranked in."
you got it on?
i got the mission timer circuit breaker in.
okay. we're going to probably need numerics lighting. there you go. you got it.
"aquarius, houston. i think we've got a better way of getting your mission time up."
go ahead with it.
"okay. we can do a verb 55, enter, and then put an r1, minus 00088. in r2, minus 00059; r3 minus 03274."
watch the crapping attitude.
we're okay.
god damn. i wish you'd get to something i know.
"well, as soon as we get over here, we'll stop it with the ttca."
okay.
"and, aquarius; houston. we've got you both on vox. pat? 203"
li.kc to go whal?
"you want us on vox, jack?"
we have you on vox. we're reading you loud and clear and the clock took good.
"okay. looks like we're on the fda route there, jack."
"okay, jack. how do you read me on normal voice now?"
"reading you 5 square, fred."
okay.
"and, aquarius, we're ready for a verb 74 when you can give it to us."
you got it.
"okay. and one other thing we noticed. when you pressurized the rcs, we got an increase in pres- sure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have you veri_ that the ascent feeds are closed. in order to do that, on panel ll, close the ascent feed i and 2 circuit breakers on - and cycle the parker valves, and then open the ascent feed circuit breakers on panel ll."
"completed, houston."
"okay, jim. thank you."
"and, jack, aquarius. what kind of return time is this maneuver given?"
that puts you back in the water at 133 hours.
"133, hey."
affirm.
and that's an atlantic landing site.
atlantic landing?
"affirmative. that's the pad that we've given you, but we may change our mind later on. we want you to have this info for now. and that's a minimum - -"
okay.
- - minim_n time returr_.
"aquarius, hour;ton. we've got to change the refsmmat to the one to which you're alined. so we'd like to have po0 and data and we'll ship that up to you."
roger.
"okay, you got it, jack."
roger. coming up.
"aquarius, could you give us data please?"
"okay, jack, you got it."
"- - the updata link, the dua breaker may not be in, jack."
"okay, fred, and close the dua breaker."
"it's in now, jack."
"okay, jim, and it's coming up now. thank you."
"aquarius, houston. we're finished with the uplink. the computer ts yours. we'd like to power down the dua, so pull the dua circuit breaker please."
okay. updata link breaker ts coming open.
"aquarius, houston. we'd like to have apt omni, and we're going to lose contact with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking. and our latest data shows that your closest approach to the moon is going to be 60 miles perigee. over."
"okay. closest approach, 60 miles, and i'm sitting on a_ omni now."
roger. we'll probably be going off the air here in about a minute.
"houston, aquarius. over."
"go ahead, aquarius. 02 il 41 19 cdr okay. we're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch. we're thinking about rigging up the urino d_ap to the side hatch and say- urin_ hoater powor. what do you think?"
stand by 1.
better still so we won't freeze up our urine dump.
"roger. that sounds like a good plan, jim. why don't you go ahead with that one?"
"okay, aquarius. and down here we're getting re- grouped, trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for ptc and taking a look at consumables as opposed to flight plan, and so forth, and as soon as we get all that in- formation, we'll pass it up to you. we also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of alinement procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window. so if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alinement out the window, why let us know."
"okay. jack, right now we're not able to. the sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and what- ever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still with us, such that the stars are hard to find, and why - what respect do you want us to do the stars out the window - just to check the lms run, is that correct?"
"that's affirmative. we'd like to correlate the information we get with your's, so that if we can use it to update the platform, we can. what we're really trying to do, jim, is see if we can do a coas aline so we can power down the platform."
"that is aquarius. we're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and we're not reading you at all."
i have good signal strength and i'm on aft omni.
"how do you read now, aquarius?"
"hey, jim, do you suppose that you could orient the lm so that the service module would be be- tween you and the sun? i believe you could see - recognize constellations out your front windows then."
"aquarius, houston. radio check."
"okay, jack. how do you read now?"
"okay. hearing you 5 square now, jim. and the question we have, is there some way you can orient the spacecraft so that the service module is be- tween the lm and the sun so you can recognize constellations out the window? and secondly, can you see anything out the aot?"
"aquarius, houston. how do you read?"
"aquarius, how do you read me now?"
"aquarius, houston. how do you read?"
"aquarius, request forward omni, please."
"aquarius, houston. request forward omni. how do you read?"
"okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read?"
"hello there, aquarius. loud and clear. how do you read me?"
there's an awful lot of background - -
"we get a lot of background static, jack. you're down in the mud. you having a ground problem?"
what we tried to do was to get the iu frequency shifted off a little bit so that we'd have less interference. i think it'll come up - what we want you to do is turn on your descent oxygen and turn off your ascent oxygen. over. and re- quest forward omni.
"you're unreadable, jack. we've got our signal strength meter - right now it keeps wavering up and down, and the best i'm getting is about 2.4 agc."
roger. request forward omni.
i am on forward omni. i've been on forward omni.
"okay. how do you read, jack?"
"i'm hearing you 5 square, fred. how me?"
"aquarium, lou_;i, on, how do you ready"
okay. we're up to about 2.6 agc now.
"aq,,awius, houston. radio check."
"okay. every time you transmit, jack, the agc starts to drop off and the static level turns up."
"okay, fred. you're loud and clear."
i wish you were.
"fred, go to descent 02 ."
descent 02 . roger.
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"hello there, aquarius. how do you read me now?"
"hello, houston. aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go."
"okay. that's the first clear word we heard from you, jack. do you think it could be my pitch attitude that's breaking up your incoming? i guess you've been hearing us."
"we have been hearing you, and the problem is on the ground. i hope we have it corrected now."
okay. that sounds good.
we're considering powering down the pgns but we want to know what capability you have to do a coarse and fine aline. we read your conversation about being unable to see out the window very good. how about out the aot?
he's looking now.
"okay. and the other thing we thought you might try is to put the service module between you and the sun and then to see if you can see anything out the window in that attitude. 02 12 05 4b cc the reason that we think that that would work is that it worked on apollo 10. it made the constellations all recognizable when we put the the service module - in our case a lm, between us and the sun. pagra'208"
"af_ omni, fred."
"you're down in the mud again, jack. it appears that some other circuit is feeding through on there with you."
roger. af_ 0mni.
"aquarius, aft omni."
"okay. you're down in the mud again, jack. lots of background static."
"aft omni, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston."
"okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read? apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription tape 41/!"
"aquarius, houston. how do you read?"
"hello, houston; aquarius. how do you read?"
"hello, there, aquarius. loud and clear. how me, now?"
"okay, we're reading you loud and clear, jack. i hope it stays this time."
"okay. we'd like to brief you on what our plan is. we're, at this time, water critical in the lm. so we'd like to use as little as possible. to do this, we're going to plan to make a free- return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. then we're going to power down the pgns, and then we'll - at 79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we got. but we'd like to get that pgns powered down as soon as possible. that would be after the midcourse and - so how do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?"
"well, we'll give it a try, jack, if that's all we've got. that's a 16-foot-per-second dps burn in 37 minutes?"
"roger. we're working up a pad for it, but we'd want to know what you think about doing it at that time."
"well, we'll do it. could you give us a little bit more time?"
"okay, jim. we'd like to get a suggested time from you. we can figure out a free-return maneuver for any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a pad."
"okay, that sounds good. i think if we have a little bit more time; we want to do it right. stand by 1."
"let's shoot for an hour if we can, jack. how's that."
"okay, jim. i(_,waboul _1 h,mr:; and '_0minute:;? that's an hour and 5 from now."
okay. we'll do it and we want to be sure we talk back and forth now to make sure we get this burn off right.
affirm.
"okay, in the interim, jack, i looked around again and i saw that we have a radar and a landing- radar heater breaker in. can i pull those out?"
affirmative. pull them both out.
"and now we want to ask you a question about alinements, and so forth. we wanted to know if you can see any stars out of the aot. we also wanted to know if you could use the service module to cast a shadow on the lm windows and then look out the windows to see stars for a ps1 coas alinement."
"okay, in this attitude, jack, that we're pitching around, i cannot use the aot to see stars. we - we're just not able to see them at all. now we may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll and see stars. right now, we haven't been able to. the aot is useless. the command module structure is just radiating too much light into the - into the telescope."
"okay, and how about using the service module to east a shadow on the commander's window? if you do that, can you see stars for a coas alinement?"
"we could give that a try, jack, although i don't know how successful it will be. we tried to do it - the light shines off our quads which makes it difficult to see stars. we do have the earth and the moon, if that can be of assistance. 02 12 27 18 iap another problem - right now, jack, i'm looking out the right window and it's pretty dark out that window but there are about a thousand or so false stars out here from - left over from some of the debris. it's hard to discern what's real and not real. _p_'41/3"
"okay. that's good information and during the time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if you ever get in a position where you think the aot might be of some use, wetd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a p52."
"okay, will do. and also, let me ask you a ques- tion. in this configuration, docked, we have to use the ttca to control pitch and roll. and, just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory? we only have 60 miles to play with."
"roger, we'll put that to them. 02 12 28 45 _ okay, jack, are you ready to go to work with me on the 2-hour dps activation and contingency hook, page 17"
"roger, we're ready to go."
"okay. item one, we can - one through five, we can scratch off, as done. is that correct?"
"stand by l, fred."
"okay, fred, let's go ahead. step l, page 1. everybody's listening. 02 12 30 28 imp okay, i've looked around, and i've essentially done steps i through 5 with the exception of floodlights and utility lights and i think we'll just do without those."
"roger. your choice. 02 12 30 47 imp okay, on eps activation, we're through step - we're through that - bottom of that page. that's all done."
"we concur, page 2."
"okay, in essence, we've circumvented step 4, and we're not sitting with all 4 aps - descent bats on high-voltage taps, so i'll scratch off step 4."
"roger, and in step 5, we want to leave inverter 1 circuit breaker open."
"roger. in step 5, we'll leave inverter 1 cb open."
"omit step 6. 02 12 31 53 _ okay, for the time being, our mission timer is the computer so, mission timer activation scratch off."
roger. 02 12 32 09 i24p okay. we've done the primary glycol loop activation.
we verify it.
"aquarius, we recommend you leave the caution and warning off on page 3. 02 12 32 37 hmp okay. i was going to say that next. page 3, we'll just scratch item 1. and item 2, i've already got the rcs heaters on. and i dontt know if i gave you the time or you got the time on the primary evap flow number 1, open."
we got the time. 02 12 33 t0 lmp okay. let's go to the cb pages now.
"fred-o, did you close the engine control breaker in panel 117"
"what control is that, jack?"
did you close the s and c engine control breaker on panel 117 as we got step 1 there on page 3.
"okay. okay, yes, the eps descent eca control breaker is closed on ll."
"roger, and how about the - on panel ll, s and c engine control, closed? aft omni, fred."
"okay. we're aft omni, and we have the s and c engine control breaker closed."
"roger. let's go on with the circuit breaker panel checkout. 02 12 34 34 mp okay. i'll just give you - i think it'll be easier to give you what i got in. okay, in the top row on 11, we have the four ac bus tie breakers in and the ac bus volts breaker in, and that's it. second row, we have the four tca breakers in. we have the gasta under flight displays and commander's fdai. and likewise under ac bus a, we have a gasta and a commander fdai breaker in. that's it. on row 3, we have a signal conditioner 1. we have the atca (pgns). we have the engine control breaker, attitude direct control breaker, and the - under lighting, anun/dock/component breaker in. and one other, ed logic power a - ed logic power a is also in."
copy.
"okay, under the fourth - fourth row, we got all the quad heater breakers in, suit fan 1. under ecs, glycol i and 2; and under comm, we have commander audio in, and pgnss lgc/dsky, imu standby, imu operate, and that's it. okay, in the bottom row, eps, we have the bat feed tie both in, and we have the cross tie balance loads in, the x lunar bus tie, descent eca control, descent eca, and the dc bus volts breaker."
roger. we copy. - -
"that completes it for panel ll. okay. stand by. okay. 02 12 36 54 _ as i see it, some of the short ones are - we need the deca gimbal in sooner or later."
that's affirmed. close the deca gimbal.
"and probably - okay, deca gimbal, and sooner or later, we're going to need deca power, i guess, also."
"all right, deca power will come up later in the procedure, fred-o."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. on your circuit breaker checklist, on panel 11 and 16, we want you to configure the panels as outlined in the checklist. pa_e 214 02 12 38 57 _ okay. you want us to configure as per checklist. okay. we'll do that."
that's right. close the black ones and open the white ones. 02 12 39 12 _ yes. i think we can manage that.
"with the activation power up, we're starting right now."
"houston, we might as well leave our rcs tcas in, right?"
"affirmative, jim. leave your rcs tcas in - - 02 12 40 26 imp check that - -"
- - on panel 11. 02 12 40 30 _ - - yes. i used my pentel pen and made those white ones black ones.
"roger. same on 16, fred."
roger.
"and you might look there, houston, to see what circuit breakers aren't required, like the tape recorder."
we're looking.
"okay, jim. on panel 11 over there, you can also leave open the rendezvous heater breaker and the landing radar heater breaker, in addition to the tape recorder."
"they're out. 02 12 42 04 _ i'm leaving a few in, jack, too, like the suit fan 1 is still in, rcs syst_ is still in, the tcas. attitude direct control is in."
roger.
how about if i leave the vhf a and b off?
switch to forward omni. ''ap_41/7
"okay. we can leave the vhf powered down, too."
"and, do you want the secondary s-band?"
negative on secondary s-band. leave them open.
up data link is in. do you want that in or out?
leave the up data link open. we'll call for it when we want you to put it in.
"okay, jack, on panel 11 on the top row, do you really want the propulsion pqgs and ascent helium regs in? 02 12 44 54 imp and, also the syst_4 engineer x- pointer breaker."
"roger. negative on the pqgs. negative on the ascent helium reg, and negative on the cross- pointer."
"okay. on the second row, i'm going to leave the floodlight breaker open."
concur. 02 12 45 31 i24p and we're again up to - do you want the cwea enabled?
negative on the cwea.
okay.
okay. since we're - are we going to power up the ags or should i concern myself with the atca breaker?
"negative on the ags. however, fred, we need the atca breaker in. 02 12 46 28 imp okay. atca breakers in. yes. i guess for the backup power supply. hey, how about atca ags."
negative on atca ags.
and i'm leaving the suit flow control breaker open.
let's close the suit flow control breaker - - 'rape41/8
"and, now ..."
- - so it doesn't take any current.
"okay. without suits, it doesn't do us much good either though. 02 12 47 52 i24p okay. and are we going to continue to be able to operate off the omnis, jack. so can i leave the s-band antenna powered down?"
"okay, fred-o. we don't plan to use the steerable antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on. so it looks you ought to open up comm s-band antenna, but leave s-band antenna heaters closed. 02 12 48 33 _ roger. comm s-band is open, s-band heater breaker is still closed."
"and, on the bottom row, jack, i'm going to leave the heater display breaker out, which we had pulled before, and eps display. but i question, do we want the ascent eca breaker in, as pres cribed?"
stand by. that's a negative on the ascent eca breaker. leave it open.
"_ld, aquarius, we need po0 and data - -"
and that's a - -
- - and we'll give you state vector and target load.
okay. we need the up link breaker in then now.
that's affirmative.
"okay. and, jack, will you give us that - how about the ordeal breaker? can i pull that? we don't need that, do we? '02 12 50 32 cc negative on the ordeal. leave it open. 02 12 50 48 _ and how about the ascent eca breaker on panel 117 jim has it in over there."
and panel ll ascent eca can be open.
it's open.
"okay, aquarius. we're go on the circuit breaker configuration as you have it now."
roger.
"and, aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the pgns dap hold your attitude for you, it will."
"okay, very well."
"and, jack, because it will take quite a while to get back to the attitude, i think we ought to think about going there very shortly."
roger. i have a pad for you. i have a p30 maneuver pad.
roger. stand by.
... --
"go right ahead, jack."
okay. we want you to hold your maneuver until we finish making the load. we haven't completed it yet. are you ready to copy p30 maneuver pad?
that's affirm.
"okay. here we go. the purpose is mideourse correction for free return. noun 33: 061:29:42.84; minus 0021.3, plus 0004.1, minus 0031.2; ha and hp are na; delta-v 0038.0; 031, 120, 298, minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312; coas na. and i have your lm gda angles. pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. your dps throttling, 5 seconds at 10 percent, burn the rest at 40 percent. your ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds."
"okay, jack, we have a p30 maneuver pad, a mid- course for free return. noun 33: 061:29:42.84; minus 0021.3, plus 004.1, minus 0031.2; ha and hp n/a; delta-v r 0038.0; 031, 120, 298; minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312. coas n/a; gda angles; pitch 5.86, roll 6.75; dps throttle 5 seconds at 10 percent; burn the rest at 40 per- cent. and we need a two-jet, 10-second ullage."
"that's a good readback, fred. i'd like to verify, however, in noun 81, in vy, it's plus three balls 41. 02 12 56 14 imp okay. noun 81, vy is plus 0004.1."
good readback. let's press on with the checklist.
"okay. and, jack, find out about using ttca to maneuver with."
"okay. we're finished with the computer, it's yours, and we recommend using the ttca to maneuver with."
"roger. 02 12 56 43 _ okay, i'm back on the checklist, page 6. jack, under pgns turn-on and self-test. we've done everything except the self test here on this page. do you want to do that at this time?"
"okay. aquarius, negative on the pgns self test. 02 12 57 37 imp okay. i'll scratch page 6 and on page 7, we're not going to activate the - or rather we had the s-band activated, ecs activation i have all done. and, at the bottom of the page, the docked imu coarse aline is done."
"roger. 02 12 58 14 ii_p wetve - okay, we've also completed, i guess in essence, all of page 8."
that's affirmative and page 9 to boot. scratch vhf. we've done the t ephems '
"okay. you've updated it, that's right. we cranked in the time."
"and, houston, let's go to activation - or get into page 10 and see what we did there."
okay. the only item on page 10 is to deploy the landing gear.
"okay, we'll do that now."
"okay. the landing gear are down and locked, jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've done all of that."
we verify that. page 12.
"okay, and i assume in amongst all those numbers you pumped up, we got a refsmmat and state vector, is that correct?"
that's affirmative. you've got that. so you can delete page 12.
"hey, on 13, you've read us up the fine aline angles and we've cranked those in."
affirmative.
"okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do dap set, the gimbal/throttle test."
"that's - okay, aquarius. we recommend omitting the dap set, gimbal/throttle test - just make sure the gim - deca power and deca gimbal cir- cuit breakers are closed. 02 13 01 33 i_mp okay, we're going to proceed now with the dap set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? or did you say delete it?"
"aquarius, delete the dap set, gimbal/throttle test. just ensure that the deca power and the deca gimbal are closed."
"okay. houston, deca power is open at this time. do you want me to close it?"
"affirmative, jim. close the deca power."
it's closed. we deleted that.
"okay. also out of that list, jack, we need the commander's throttle set to throttle and min. 02 13 02 58 _ houston, if i recall the launch set of the gimbals, the gdas are not correct here, and where are we going to get those set for the burn?"
stand by 1.
"okay. here's the word on the dap set, gimbal/ throttle test. let's do step 1 and step 2, and that'll get our gimbal set."
"roger. 02 13 04 20 _mp okay, jack, we're going to have to back up on this, if we're going to follow the procedure here, which has us go mode control; pgns, auto, we're going to have to pull the tca breakers to keep from firing jets."
"stand by, fred."
"stand by on step l, fred. we're getting the word for you. how do you like this sim?"
it's a beauty.
"okay, aquarius, we recommend you do the dap set and gimbal/throttle test as per the checklist. go pgns auto and proceed."
"well, we're going to fire our thrusters as soon as we go to auto because we've got those thrusters in - the thruster circuit breakers. do you want us to do that and stop?"
"okay, aquarius, we're recommending you go to auto. let the thrusters fire and settle down and proceed with the test."
we're in pgns auto.
"roger, your dap is set, you're in wide deadband. that ought to do the trick."
roger.
"okay, we're looking at it, aquarius. we're ready to proceed with the test. 02 13 07 26 i_mp okay, we're proceeding. 02 13 07 52 _ okay, and houston, you - you're looking at the weights now. those are still good, right?"
you're go on the weights.
"aquarius, houston. we'd like you to recycle on the dap load and change your dap to '52021. over."
"okay, aquarius. we're looking at your gimbal and we notice that we got a four-jet ullage loaded in the dap and we gave you two jets on the pad. but, let's go with what we've got loaded. it'll be a four-jet ullage."
okay.
"okay, houston. how does the gdas look now?"
the gdas are go as they are. press on.
"okay, houston, we're going to do the dps pressurization and checkout."
stand by 1.
"okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready for the dps pressurization and checkout."
"okay, houston, do you want to follow up on page 15 with rcs checkout? in essence, we've kind of already done that."
"you're right, aquarius. let's delete the rcs checkout. and a dps looks go."
"houston, we're going to do a pgns auto maneuver to the attitude."
"stand by on that. aquarius, we recommend driving it around there manually with a ttca."
"okay, we'll have to use the ttca. roger."
"we're going to auto now, houston, to try to damp the rates. we're at the attitude."
"roger, jim. we verify the attitude."
roger.
"and, houston, we'd like to confirm, do you want the verb 65 enter in there?"
affirmative on the verb 65. 02 13 23 49 _p okay.
"okay, jack. i got another question on page 18. at 1 minute, i concur with master arm on_ but i wonder why i have to have the abort stage breaker in. we sure don't want any staging now."
"aquarius, delete the abort stage circuit breaker close. leave it open. 02 13 24 46 _ roger. will delete. 02 13 24 55 _ okay. also, jack, since we have four-jet ullage versus two, do you want - still want l0 seconds ullage or do you want 5 now?"
"okay, aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage."
okay. we'll just let the 7-1/2-second auto ullage do it.
"roger, and we'd like tc do this in manual throttle, so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down, throttle control, manual, vice auto. 02 13 25 35 _ okay. we're set to manual."
what's the 203 ... ?
"enter on the 203, jim."
"we've got 203 in the dsky now and it looks as though it requires work, can we pass it?"
"aquarius, enter on the 203."
wait a minute.
"aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle is in the min position."
that's affirm.
"and, in the event that you have to do a manual takeover, turn the engine gimbal off, mode control to attitude hold, and use the hand - use the ttca."
roger.
"okay, 1 plus 30 to burn. 02 lj 28 20 cc roger. 02 13 28 45 ia__ okay, master arm's on; 1 minute."
"roger, aquarius. you're go for the burn."
40 percent.
"okay, aquarius. you're looking good."
"auto shutdown. 02 13 30 40 imp okay. you're looking at 1685 now, jack."
"okay. you're go in the residuals, proceed."
"okay. when you say go on the residuals, you mean don't trim them. is that right?"
that's affirmative. no trim required.
roger. 02 13 31 08 _ okay.
"aquarius, check your master arm off, please."
"okay, houston. burn's complete. now we have to talk about powerdown, and what do you want us to do with the pgns?"
"roger. we're looking at that right now, and you'll be the first one to get the word."
"and, houston, it's doubtful right now whether we'll be able to see the stars in this configura- tion. the only way we could possibly get aline- ment is with the earth and the terminator or the moon and its terminator and i'd sure like to have you look at a powerdown - keeping the pgns if at all possible."
"roger, jim. we'll get the word for you."
"and, houston, we're in an att hold mode, can we turn off the buses?"
"stand by on that one, jim. tape l_l/l_"
"okay, aquarius. we're working on what's going to happen next. in the meantime, we'd like to take some high-power items off the line, so on panel ll, open deca power, and open deca gimbal. on 16, open the atca breaker."
"okay, on 11, we got deca power, deca gimbal, open. on 16, we got the atca breaker open."
"and, houston, while you're thinking, see if you can come up with a procedure of perhaps using the command module optics with manual drive to perhaps look for stars."
roger.
"and, jack, aquarius. while you're thinking - before we had our comm problems, we were wanting to know what to - whether we should hook up the side hatch urine dump system. so we wouldn't freeze up the normal urine dump system."
"roger. we gave you a go on that earlier. sorry, you must have missed it. use the side hatch for urine dump."
okay.
"and, how are the stars out the window now?"
"well, i'll look again, jack, but at this attitude, the sun is reflecting off of - off of quad 4 so bright that it's ruining any night vision and we still got particles floating around us; i'll have to take a long look and see if i can see any star patterns."
"roger. and aquarius, we're going to have to hand you over to a different site now, and we think maybe things will work better if this time we turn off the s-band transmitter/receiver, and bring it back up in 5 minutes. you copy?"
okay. stand by 1.
okay. i understand you want us to turn off the s-band transmitter/receiver and bring it up in 5 minutes. is that correct?
that's affirmative.
tell us when.
and you want us to maintain attitude control.
affirmative on the attitude control.
that's auto attitude control. okay. you main- tain auto attitude control.
"okay, jack, i'm back on the line now. on the s-band, you want me to turn off the transmitter/ receiver and the power amps are off for 5 m_nutes. is that - when you give me the word - is that what you want?"
"aquarius, leave the power amplifier the way it is. turn the transmitter/receiver off for 5 minutes. now. 02 13 44 19 _ okay. you tell me - you tell me when."
"okay. turn it off now. see you in 5 minutes. 02 13 44 26 _ okay. it's gone off. it's gone off for 5 minutes. apoi,ii)  3 atr-t()-p, roui'i voice transcript'on"
"aquarius, houston. how do you read?"
"okay. you're loud and clear there, jack."
roger. same here. we're - we're still discussing the next move.
i figured it. let's just make it a good one.
"we're looking real close at water usage profiles, and right now things are kind of swinging toward leaving the imu powered up and powering down the lgc, but we'll have more word for you shortly. and we recommend for sleeping that you leave one guy on watch. we recommend you don't make any urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll make the debris problem worse than it is now. and we have some items that you might want to transfer to the lm, some towels, some penlights, fecal bags, uts. and do you have any more items that we can help you out with at the mcxnent?"
"okay. stand by on your latter list there, jack. i understand no urine dumps. i guess we'll work through the ucd and all the bags we got; and real quick there, can you give a dap load that we want in here now to conserve the rcs."
"okay. for attitude control coordinates, we're recommending manual control verb 76 and watch your middle gimbal angle. your dap load that you have now looks good."
okay. it's att hold verb 76 for the guy on watch. and the dap load we got right now is okay.
"aquarius, our decision for the time is to leave the imu powered up, power down the lgc, and power down other nonessential items. we'll be coming up with a more precise checklist as soon as we can get it. over."
"okay. the decision is to keep the platform, power down the computer, and we'll be standing by for further word on the powerdown, jack."
roger. i'ap__ 4:'/:' pa6_' 227
"and, aquarius, for your information, we now have 136-mile perigee. confirmed by doppler."
okay. 136-mile perigee now. that's very nice.
"oh, wait a minute, jack. did you say pericynthion or perigee?"
i meant pericynthion.
ah. that's better.
"and, houston, we pulled out your updata link circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for anything, let us know and we'll put it back in."
"roger, jim. we will."
"aquarius, aft omni, please."
aft omni.
"houston, do you read apollo 137"
this is houston. go ahead. reading you weakly.
"okay, jack. we don't want to bug you, but you ought to be thinking - or what your thoughts are concerning what the next burn will be. i got to figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule and just how we can meet the next maneuver."
"roger. we're getting you a flight plan update. we're still computing on your next burn, and we're getting ready to give you a procedure for powerdown."
"aquarius, one idea on managing the omni antennas. it might make it easier on everybody if we disabled the uplink squelch and managed the antennas by switching when we hear the noise. over."
roger. will do.
"okay, aquarius. here's what we're going to do. we'd like you to point the lm x-axis either north or south. that's the positive x-axis. it appears to us that it would be closer to orient the lm plus x-axis toward the south. do that with the lgc powered up using the ttca. after that, we propose to power down the lgc to save some power. however, this means that we lose the use of the ttca, and we'll have to control the spacecraft with the hand controller in the direct mode. request your - your position on these two items."
"aquarius, houston. how do you read?"
"okay, jack. understand. you want us to point the lm x - plus x-axis to the south using the ttcas with the lgc powered up. then, by powering down the lgc, we'll lose a ttca. i wasn't too successful in controlling the spacecraft in at- titude only, but i might be able to keep it out of gimbal lock."
"that's affirmative, jim. we'd keep your ball powered up and go to direct on the hand controller. and maintain attitude in a direct position."
"okay. understand; and do you want some sort of a ptc mode, jack?"
"affirmative. we'll take whatever ptc mode you can set up, jim."
"okay. and since you know our approximate attitude, how about just getting me something to find you on the dsky for a southerly plus x-direction."
roger. stand by 1.
"and one other question, houston. when you say power down the dsky or the lgc, do you mean going into 06 or multiple circuit breaker?"
"stand by on powering down the dsky, jim. we'll give you the procedure for that. the procedure that we - - 02 11_30 57 cdr okay."
"- - the procedure that we have is listed in several places. it's in the contingency checklist under ""power down"" on page 1, second paragraph."
"and we'll give you that word when we want you to do that. that's lgc only, not to power down the imu. but we'd like to have you hold off on that until we send you the word. over. la_c 4'2/4 fage 229"
understand.
"and, aquarius, while we're working on this, we have a proposed flight plan update for your work- ing and resting cycles. and - you ready to copy?"
"okay. do you want me to write this in the flight plan, per se, jack?"
you can probably write it on a piece of scratch paper. this is pretty easy.
okay. go ahead. we got a lot of scratch paper.
"okay. we're suggesting that the lmp rest while the cmp and cdr are awake. lmp ought to hit the sack at about 63 hours, coming up in 25 minutes. and you get to rest for 6 hours. you get up at 69 hours. at 70 hours, the commander and the command module pilot sleep for 6 hours until 76 hours. around 70 - 76-1/2 to 77 hours, we'll do a ps1 and a 52. at 78:30, we'll load p30 and aline ags to pgns. our ignition time for a second burn will be, presently, 79:25:26.5, and we'll have a pad for you shortly. we suggest that all of you eat after the burn. that'll be 81 to 82 hours. let the cmp and cdr eat while you are sleeping. and that you grab a bite as soon as you can. over."
"okay, jack. as i read that, the lmp is to go to sleep at 63:00 for about 6 hours. during that period, the cdr and cmp should try to get a bite to eat. i'm to awake at 69 hours. cdr and cmp sleep at 70 hours, and they are to awake at 76 hours. and we should plan on doing our ps1, p52 at 76 hours or 76:30. at 78:30, we're going to load a p30 and aline ags to pgns. second maneuver is to take place at 79:25:26.5 for ignition time. then we're all to eat at 81 to 82 hours."
"okay. with a minor modification, your p51, p52 will be about 77 hours, and that's the period of darkness. and the commander and the cmp ought to eat around 68 to 69 hours, and you should eat between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up. we have left an hour in there where everybody is awake together to talk things over. go ahead. 02 14 38 4_ lmp okay. i'll eat after i wake up between 69 and 70. 02 14 '_f_5_ cc ali rikht we have additional - - 02 14 38 55 _ - - and i've got the correction to p - -"
"go ahead, fred."
"yes. we got the word the p51, p52 is going to be done around 77 hours, while we're in darkness."
"that's affirmative. and we have a work-rest cycle laid out for further on, which we can relay to you later. 02 14 39 22 _ okay."
"okay. and, houston, you have advice on what attitude you want me to go to."
"okay. that'll be the next bit of information. i'll get that for you, jim."
okay.
"and, aquarius, just to get you thinking in that direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis, and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper to keep the lgc and the dsky up and turn the inverter and the ball off. it's going to save us 1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what we're going to do. and we'll have to monitor the middle gimbal angle. and we'll get the procedure on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode where we'll be able to use the ttca through the - through the dap."
"that sounds great, jack."
"aquarius, houston. we've got a procedure for you. ready to copy?"
ready to copy.
"okay. it's pretty easy. we see you've already got verb 16 noun 20 called up there and so we want you to, in maneuver and pgns attitude hold, use the ttca. we want you to, on the commander's ball, pitch to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. and when you do this in verb 16 noun 20, on the dsky, you ought to read plus 00120, plus 26750, and plus 00450. go ahead."
"okay. we're to drive the commander's ball to a pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. and we should have in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750, plus 00450."
that's a good readback. we'll watch the maneuver.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
roger. you didn't mention roll on the ball. do you want roll zero?
"the roll ought to be plus 1.2, jim."
roger.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim."
"okay. we're just about there in pitch and in ... middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle didn't look like it pulled the right way. i tried both methods."
"yes. i been looking at that, too, and we're ask- ing why, and we'll get an answer for you."
"yes. houston, i wonder if you're accounting for being a bit off the bellyband here, and i've gone through gasta."
"and, fred-o, i know you're supposed to start sleeping here pretty soon, but we got a new pc plus 2 pad, p30 maneuver pad for you."
"stand by. 02 15 05 32 l_p okay. go ahead, jack."
"okay, fred. p30 maneuver purpose is pc plus 2, dps to this time, we're going to the mil. and noun 33, 079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443, minus 02226, apogee is n/a, perigee is plus 00205, 08455, 420, 268, 261, plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 02187, coas is n/a. your gda ought to be okay as it is from the last burn, but pitch ought to he at 5.85; in roll, it's 6.74. your ullage will be two jets for t0 seconds. your dps throttle w:ibe 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 per- cent 'or2/ _mconds, and th_ remainder at full 1,hroi;l,l,_.and for your inl'o'rmation,chi:w_./ put you in l.hewater at 142 plus 47. over. 02 15 07 46 _ okay. dps, pericynthion plus 2 into the mpl, 079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443, minus 00226, n/a, plus 00205, 08455, 4 plus 20, 268, 261, plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 021, 2187, n/a. gda should be okay as is, which hopefully is pitch 5.85, yaw 6.74. two-jet ullage for 10 seconds, the dps throttle 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 100 per- cent for the rest of the burn. and this should put us into the water at 142 plus 47."
"okay, fred. i have a correction in noun 81. delta-v z is minus 02226. read back."
okay. delta-v z in noun 81 is minus 02226.
okay. good readback. 02 15 09 41 imp somehow that didn't add up with the delta-v x to give a delta-v r of that magnitude. it seems like it'd been bigger.
"okay. we'll take another look at it, fred."
"okay, houston. i'm not having too much luck hold- ing this particular attitude."
"okay, jim. stand by 1."
"okay, aquarius. when you get her pretty much in attitude there, and it looks like you're as close as we need to be, we'd like to try a control mode and see if it will work; sort of a semi-ptc. we'll leave the ball powered up for this, and if this doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to attitude hold mode. but - stand by l, please."
"we'd like you to think about this control mode, jim, and see if you think it might work from what you know right now. we're a little skepti- cal, but we'd like to put it to you. so, once you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in verb 16 noun 20, go to pgns minimum impulse, verb 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw rate to the right. monitor the middle gimbal on tape 42/$ pmge 233 r3 on the dsky and see if she'll kind of stabilize out. if not, the only other suggestion we've got is to go to pgns attitude hold. we'll keep the ball up until you make this evaluation."
"okay, houston. you cut out, say again."
"okay. where'd you lose me, jim?"
i lost you when you said try the control mode; you're a little skeptical.
"okay. from what you say, we have to be a little skeptical of this proeedure, but we'd like to have you try it and have you evaluate it. you can monitor the middle gimbal on r3. before we power down the ball, we want you_ evaluation. the next best choice is pgns attitude hold. over."
okay. i'll try it.
okay. go ahead with the control mode procedure.
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
okay. i'm not ... you. i can monitor register 3. i can probably keep it out of ... - going into gimbal lock.
roger. how are pitch and roll?
"okay. i think i can control the gimbal angles in 16 20 with the compressors the way they are, but i'll have to try mii_imum impulse - just a minute."
"okay, jack. i've a question - one more question about odyssey."
"go ahead. apoi,i,o 3 air-to-ground voice tr_ischiption"
"okay, i still have the pyro a sequence a and pyro b sequence b circuit breakers in. do you want those out?"
stand by 1.
"odyssey, houston. the two circuit bre_ers you referred to, leave them in."
okay. copy. leave them in.
"okay, houston. i can control yaw in minimum impulse, but stand by on pitch."
"and, fred-o, the delta-v r resultant computes with the components."
"fred's off the comm now, jack."
roger. your pad is good.
"and, jack, we didn't get that whole sentence there."
okay. i said that the delta-v r that fred questioned computes well with the component - its rms.
okay. copy.
"okay, now. jack, let's go over this once more. you wanted me to try out control of the space- craft in the pulse mode. is that correct?"
that's affirmative. set up a yaw rate and moni- tor the middle gimbal angle.
"okay. i can do that. i'm not too sure whether i can control roll or pitch in pulse, but i can control yaw in pulse - yaw in pulse on the ball."
"roger. and remember we're not going to have a ball there, so that we're going to be monitoring cdus on the dsky, and if we get it off, it will be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back to; and, well, in addition, have to control the omnis while we're doing this."
roger.
"without the ball, i still have use of the ttca for control of the - angles."
affirmative. you'll have the ttca for pitch and roll.
"okay. i think i can do that without the ball, and if you just give me the ttcas i think i can control the spacecraft using 16 20."
i'm going to yaw right.
"okay, jack. i am now - the register 1 is in the decrease mode."
"and, houston, do you see anything wrong with this spacecraft motion?"
"we have a data drop on right now, jim; we'll look at it as soon as it comes up."
"okay, aquarius. we're going to dispense with this control mode. we'd like you to fly the machine back to the original attitude that you had, and we'll go pgns attitude hold, and then we've got to get that ball off the line to save some power. and then, in order to keep even heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll - of yaw."
okay. you want me to go back to original attitude. i'll be going back to it now.
"okay, houston; aquarius. i'm flying it back over towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch of 257. i'll get near the bellyband in roll and yaw; then i'll go to pgns att hold."
"that's affirmative, jim. and then we're going to have you go through a powerdown procedure."
okay.
and you'll need verb 77 with att hold when you get there.
will do.
"okay, jack. have i gotten your 360 on yaw and roll? i'm going to go to att hold."
roger. and then we want to get the hall part down.
okay. stand by.
okay. i'm now in pgns att hold. and are you reading my dsky angles?
roger. we see them.
"now, you want me to power down the ball, and if you'll give me the procedure for that, i'll do it right away."
"okay. we'll buy what you've got on the dsky there, and we'd just like to go through an overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will only take a few minutes. so are you ready to start on panel 117"
"roger. jack will copy, and i'll do the work."
"okay. panel 11, top row, open all the circuit breakers."
all circuit breakers on top row coming open.
"they're all open, top row."
"okay. second row, close the first six on the left through the isol valve and open all to the right of that."
"okay. first six on the left are closed - that's through the isol valve, but i opened up every one from there on."
"okay. third row, open up the next five - correction - open up the first five on the left, close aot heater, close sig conditioner 1. close attitude direct, and open the rest on row three."
"do you want atca (pgns) open? (1215 34 53 cc leave atca (pgns) closed; four breakers on the third row must be closed. aot heater, sig con- ditioner 1, and atca (pgns), attitude direct control. our mistake, good going."
okay. i'm opening up engine start override right now. and that row's taken care of.
"okay. on the fourth row. open - from the left, open the first five - correction - close the first five, and open cabin fan 1. close the three glycol pump circuit breakers; open all the comm breakers, except for commander's audio; close it. ail the pgns breakers, open - correc- tion - open the first three pgns breakers, close lgc/dsky, imu standby, imu operate."
"that's complete, jack."
"okay. and eps, close bat feed ties, crosstie bal load, and open the cross tie bus. close the next three; open ascent eca control, ascent eca, and inverter 1. close dc bus volt. go ahead."
"that's complete, jack. panel 11 is configured."
"okay. let's go over to panel 16, top row, and starting from the left - open the first four."
"stand by, jack."
"okay. starting from the left, open the first four."
"okay. and close the isol valve, keep your tca breakers closed, close the crossfeed, open the next two displays. close the main sov and the propulsion breakers should all three be open."
"roger. the main valves are closed, and the display engine override logic's coming open, and the pqgs and asc he reg are open."
"that's affirmative. the second row: they should all be open except for three breakers under in- strumentation. close sig sensor, pcm/te, and sig conditioner 2. over."
roger. do you want suit flow control open?
"engine arm coming open and asa i guess will be open. is that correct? '?""h""' 'iill''"
we just got a change on that. let's keep the asa closed.
how about suit flow control and engine arm?
"okay, jim. suit flow control can be open, and engine arm - engine arm open."
okay t let's go to row 3.
"okay. row 3 under comm. open displays, close se audio, open vhf a transmitter and b receiver, close the primary s-band circuit breakers, both of them. open the s-band antenna, pmp closed, tv open, and all the rest of them open under ecs, except c02 sensor, closed."
roger.
"okay. under row 4: under heaters, your rcs quad heaters should - four of them - be closed, open displays, open s-band antenna, open sequence camera. under eps, open displays, close dc bus volt, open inverter 2, open ascent eca control and ascent eca, close descent eca, descent eca control, translunar bus tie, close cross tie bal loads, open cross tie bus, close bat feed ties. over."
"that's been completed, jack."
"okay, jim. and we've already got a change to what we just told you. under ecs, close the cabin repress, and insure that the asa breaf_r is closed under s and c."
"the asa breaker is closed, but i closed the cabin repress."
"okay, jim. looks like what we have to do is - in order to maintain even heating, we just have to yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour in increments. so we'll give you a call when it's time to yaw 90 degrees."
"okay. we have to yaw the machine as i understand it, houston, and you'll give it to me in incre- ments of 90 degrees."
that's affirm.
"okay, jim. your present configuration has the following features. we got the electrical buses cross tied through the bal idad circuit breakers, and we have a_o cabin repress. one thing we'd ke to do right now is to giw, you an uplink, so immediately we have to, on p_e2 11, close the updata link circuit bre_er. go to po0 and data. over."
okay. we're going to po0 and data. the circuit breaker is closed.
"houston, aquarius. did you say that you had a new pad for us to copy?"
"jim, i passed that newest pad that we have to fred about 30 minutes ago. that's our latest. it's pc plus 2, and it begins with noun 33 of 79 hours 27 minutes and 40.13 seconds. you got that one?"
okay. we've got that one. what kind of a att hold mode do you want us to do? do you want us to do wide deadband? i didn't ... on the dap.
"jim, the deadband is good the way it is. it's 5 degrees, if you want to stay in it. and stay in the pgns att hold mode."
okay.
"two things, jim. we want you to know that there's some pretty big attitude errors in, so if you go to auto, the computer is going to try to crank you around, and the other thing is don't drink water out of the lm."
okay. you might think about this. you know we lost our oxygen pressure in the command module.
"aquarius, we're finished with the uplink. the computer is yours, and you can open the updata link circuit breaker."
"okay. we've opened up the updata link, and we've gone off of data, and i've get 16 20 in the computer."
"roger, jim. i guess we're going to just kind of perk away here now. page 240"
"okay, jack. one more question about odyssey here."
"go ahead, jack. 02 5 52 50 cmp okay. how about the service module 02 supply valve? do you want that off?"
"affirmative. service module 02 supply off, jack."
okay. on the way.
"and, jim, we see a program alarm in there. we think it's just got to do with pulling the updata link circuit breaker - uplink too fast."
roger. i don't see it. should i reset?
"go ahead and reset, jim."
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"one thought that might occur here is that if we have low descent water pressure, we might con- sider taking the plss water and fill it in re- verse. if that works, you might look at a procedure for that."
that's a good thought. let us bounce that around a little.
"okay, jim. that's a good thought, and we've looked at that, and it looks like that's feasible. so if and when we need to do that, we will."
"and, something else, jack. when it's time for me to make my 90-degree yaw, what i planned on doing was going to noun 76 hold and just pulse and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope that pitch and roll stay within the limit."
roger. it sounds like a good plan and you can use your ttca in min impulse to take care of pitch and roll.
okay.
"aquarius, houston. we see ascent 02 tank num- ber 2 building up again, so we'd like to use something out of it, so turn on ascent 02 tank number 2 and turn off descent 02 . 02 16 o0 39 ci)h ilof,_r. oper, in_: up ,t:;e,'mt op ttmk rimnber ?, arid t.urnirl/.; oft ,j_:;;('.'_nl,."
"and, aquarius, houston. we're starting to thira about c02 buildup up in the command module there so we've got a recommendation, and what we're recommending is that you take the commander's hoses in the lm and put a cap over the red return hose and then figure out a way to fasten those hoses so they blow up into the csm by extending them up through the tunnel as far as possible. and we'll get some flow out the blue side, circulate up and around the command module and to keep the co2 level down."
"roger. we're thinking of that too, and one problem is that the comm is connected securely to the hose, so we've got to get the comm.cable off somehow to get that - so we'll still have comm down here in the lm and you have the hose up there."
"houston, we're trying to extend that commander's hose by use of the vacuum hose."
"sounds like a good plan if you can work that out, jim."
"aquarius, if you can shake jack loose there, i've got a - some procedures for him to write down."
"okay. stand by. 02 16 07 33 cml= okay, jack. is this a long one?"
"oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. it's a matter of verifying some valves and so forth."
okay. go ahead.
"okay. we want you to go in when you can and verify the following valves and leave them as we outline here. repress package valve, off; emergency cabin pressure, off; direct 02, off; demand reg, off; both water accumulators, off; main reg a and b, open; water glycol - correc- tion - water and then glycol tank inlet and outlet, both. now if you want to get some water, we recommend that you momentarily turn the surge tank on to pressurize the system and then turn it off and take out water as required. over. 'l'a_e43/?"
"that's it, jack. and tmother note on taking water; rifyou don't drain enough water so that - -"
"say again, aquarius."
"that wasn't us, jack."
"okay. one more note on the water, jack. if you don't bleed the pressure off when you - don't take enough water to bleed the pressure off completely, the pressure that's left on there is going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours. so it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might as well save it. so if you want to eliminate that problem you could completely drain the pres- sure off by putting the water in a water bag and saving it that way. 02 16 10 36 cml okay. that's a good idea."
so that's the end of _y - -
"what i'll do - let me repeat - okay. let me repeat it all back to you. repress package valve, off; emergency cabin pressure, off; direct 02, off; both the demand regs, off; both h20 accumu- lators, water glycol accumulators, off; main reg a and b, open; water and glycol tank inlet and outlet, open; for water, momentarily pres- surize the surge tank, take out water as re- quired. you're recommending drain out all the water until i can't get any more water out of it in order to conserve the oxygen."
okay. we just want you to turn off the water accumulators and not the glycol accumulator. over.
"okay. these are the water accumulators on 382, right?"
that's affirm. the accumulators on 382.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go."
"roger, jack. we're asking whether p51 and a p52 are required in the back side of the moon. 02 16 3'(_6 cc i think so, jim, but stand by while i veri_y it. 07 6 38 23 cc aquarius, llouston."
go ahead.
"we think we know where the platform is, jim. the tracking looks real good from the last burn. we feel just a p52 will be required."
okay.
"joe, has your continued tracking changed our pericynthion altitude any?"
"stand by. we'll get the latest on that, jack."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"roger, jack. we're still looking at 137 miles and doppler's confirming it. we will have a good update after 67 hours."
that's good. i want to say you guys are doing real good work.
"so are you guys, jack."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. we've come up with a comm recommen- dation which we hope will save some power by powering down the power amplifier, if it works. and i'd like to read up the steps to you and have you think about them for a minute, and we recommend trying it before the first yaw maneuver. over."
okay. you can read up the steps.
"okay. step 1, biomed off; step 2, go to low bit rate; step 3, go to downvoice backup; step 4, power amp to prime; step 5, panel 16, power amp circuit breaker open; step 6, range function switch, off. read those back to me, and then i'll have a remark."
"okay. biomed, off; low bit rate; downvoi_-_e backup; power amp to prime; circuit breakers, panel 16, power amp circuit breaker, open. range function switch, off."
"okay. and the note says that you should be able to hear us. if we can't hear you in a couple of minutes, you should close the power amp circuit breaker on panel 16, and we expect to save an amp or more on this. it should work in the pres- ent attitude. when we go to the new yaw attitude, we're thinking about powering up the steerable, leaving the power amp off and, if we can get good comm in that mode, we'll still save some power. so if you concur, why don't you go ahead."
"okay. in this mode, you should hear us - or we should hear you, but if you can't hear us, then we ought to close power amp circuit breaker again. is that right."
that's affirm. we'll just run a little comm check after you get done and see how we're doing.
"okay, fine. and if that all fails, we'll go back to our original configuration."
that's affirm.

power amps in primary.
"okay. circuit breakers 16, power amp circuit breaker, open; comm; power amp circuit breaker, open."
there's only one. ready?

it is off ....
"yes, i think so; yes, that's off."
"... okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read me?"
"aquarius, this is houston. we read you with a lot ... static. how do you read us? over. o;_ 1(_52 03 cdr we read you with a lot of noise, the noise seen_ to indicate ... read you better."
"i didn't copy your last remark, jim. i heard that you had a lot of noise in the background also."
"okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read us now?"
"just the same, jim. you're readable but it's very noisy. ai'oi,i,o i'_ all-to-ci_ouni) voici,: 'i'iat_::iicii'tioii"
okay. we can still read you. do you want us to remain in this configuration?
"stay there for the next miaute or two auyway, jim, while we evaluate it."
"okay. i'll tell you what we need, jack. try to get this squared away again. we - see if you can't report the right procedures here .... the procedures, the whole works, before we get all balled up here."
yes. okay. you guessed it.

yes.
"... well, we should have some around here somewhere."
yes. they are ...
"oh, here they are ...."

"well, is there anything ... done earlier?"
"okay. what we do here is, ...?"
...
... the command module.
"find the flight plan, too, while up there."
okay. why don't you recopy this procedure on page 4-42.
we going to keep a log of all the procedures?
"we ought to copy down the ones that get water, too .... keep them all in one spot. 02 17 ob 23 cc aquarius, houston. over. 02 17 0b 29 cdr go ahead, houston."
"okay. speak slow because there's a lot of noise in the background. have you completed your first 90-degree yaw maneuver? and, if you haven't, we recommend it. over."
okay. we have not. we have not completed it. we will start. we want you to monitor the maneuver. over.
"okay, jim. and i want to pass you up a short procedure for activating the s-band steerable antenna, which we'd like you to do after you complete the 90-degree yaw. are you ready to copy? over."
ready to copy.
"okay. first, on panel 11, close the s-band antenna circuit breaker. then go to activation, page 28, steerable antenna activation - -"
roger. copy.
"- - and complete steps 2, 3, and 4 of activa- tion 28. you'll have to do a verb 64 to get the pitch and yaw angles, and the last step is on panel 16, s-band antenna heater circuit breaker to close. over. 02 17 05 0;_ cdr joe, we didn't get all of that. we just have, ""complete steps 2, 3, and 4 of activation"" and then 68 or 28."
"jim, that's - -"
then do a verb 64 to get -
"aquarius, houston. that procedure i just passed you, please disregard it. over."
disregard it. okay. do you want me to start my yaw maneuver now? and i'll be yawing to my right. one-way maneuver.
"roger. right yaw is acceptable, but wait 1 before you start the maneuver."
roger.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. you are go to con_aence the yaw maneuver. if we don't have comm after you complete the yaw maneuver, bring the power amplifier back on. over."
roger. understand. we'll start the yaw.
okay.

"why don't you go rate/rate now, before we ..."
"we're on the ascent tank, too."
"houston, aquarius. did you call?"
"negative, houston. we did not call. how you reading us?"
get up front and turn that antenna ...
"and, houston, could you give us an approximate time to turn off the ascent 02 in case we're losing point with you?"
"roger, jim; and copying about half your words."
"roger, houston. we'd like a time to go back to descent 02 in case we lose communications with you."
"jim, houston. that's affirmative. you may go back to descent 02. over."
roger. going back now.
copy that.
we're ... up-side down.
yes.
think we'll have any trouble getting that ... with that ... in there?
"probably not, if everything holds together because we already made one burn."
"and the temperatures look good. when you make a burn, does that do something ...?"
...
"well, jack. this is going to be difficult."
......
"i'll tell you, we'll have to start thinking about ... tape_4/5"

"houston, aquarius. are you ...?"
"aquarius, houston. say again, please ...."
roger. we have a radio check at a new attitude.
"okay, jim. we copy the angles. how are you receiving the voice now? over."
your voice is excellent.
"okay. real good. you a_'eclear. we still have a lot of noise, but if you talk slow i think we can manage."
"aquarius, houston."
this is aquarius. go ahead.
"roger, jim. we're trying to improve our comm down here. we'd like to try going function switch from down voice backup to voice. over."
... down voice backup ... switch going from down voice backup to voice.
roger that.
"how do you read now, jim?"
"aquarius, houston. request a short count. over."
"aquarius, houston. we're not reading you at all. request you go back to down voice backup. over."
"all right. houston, aquarius in down voice backup. how do you read? over."
"okay, jim, we read you now and you'd better stay in this configuration."
"well, ... try ..."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim, since we're in low bit rate now, we cannot monitor the dsky for program alarms, et cetera, and we recommend that, in order for you to do so on board, you push in the following circuit breakers: on panel 11 and panel 16 the anunciator/dock/component circuit breakers. that will allow you to monitor your dsky warning lights. over."
okay ...
"..., off."
"roger, houston. would you say one more time ... please?"
"okay, jim. the circuit breakers are the anunciator/dock/component circuit breakers on panel 11, third row, far right, under lighting; and on panel 16, also under lighting, second row, third from the left. over."
"roger, houston. we have those two circuit breakers - engaged."
"okay, real good."
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, this is houston. go ahead. 02 17 _1 2_ cdr joe, it appears that the best detent possibly to put the stars in the aot, would be either number 2 or 4. the rendezvous radar antenna is now in the way. you might think of a pro- cedure to get rid of it with minimum power and then we maybe we'll be able to see stars in a couple of minutes here in a lower detent."
"okay, jim. i think i understood that the rendezvous radar antenna is in the way and you would like a procedure to get it out of the way. is that right?"
"that's affirm; at the proper time, and with minimum power."
roger. understand. we'll work that.
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay. jim, we have a handover coming up on the hour; that's in a minute and a half. _ the hour, we would like you to turn the s-band transmitter/receiver switch to off, and 5 min- utes later turn it back to primary. over."
"okay, houston. shortly you want us to turn the s-band transmitter/receiver to off; 5 min- utes later, turn it back to primary."
"that's affirmative, jim. after the handover apparently they want to make sure that they lockup with you and not the iu."
roger. and let me know when you want me to turn it off.
roger. you can turn it off now.
"and, houston, when do you want me to turn that s-band transmitter/receiver off?"
"aquarius, houston. turn it off now."
turning it off now.
"okay, aquarius; houston. we have data back and i assume we have comm. over. 02 18 08 5 (h)h liouston, i,his is aquarius. 'l%e co_ is very, very, very noisy. over."
"aquarius, houston. copy that. it's noisy on our end, too; stand by while we think about it."
"houston, aquarius. i am unable to ... now ..."
"jim, houston. i think you just called, but i didn't copy you."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, recommend you push the power amplifier circuit breaker on panel 16 in. over."
roger. power amplifier circuit breaker panel 16 going in. 02 18 11 t6 cdr power amplifier circuit breaker is in.
"okay, jim. how is the comm now? over."
a lot of background noise. let me turn off the squelch.
okay. you're quite a bit better.
"whenever i enable squelch, i lose you. over."
roger. stand by. you are much better down link.
look at noun 65.
okay.
"okay, jim. this is houston. we recommend that you set the function switch from downvoice backup to voice. over."
roger. function switch going from downvoice backup to voice.
"okay, jim. how's the comm now?"
"function switch ... there's still a lot of background noise, joe."
okay. we'll look at it some more. your comm down to us is excellent now.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
the noise we're experiencing is similar to what we had sometime before when you switched sta- tions.
"roger, jim. inco is checking into what we can do about the noise. it may be a problem with the new site."
roger.
"aquarius, houston. is the noise any better now? over."
this is aquarius. negative.
"roger. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription fage 255 02 18 33 34 cdh houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
roger. will you let us know when you want us to yaw another 90 degrees right?
"will do, jim. stand by 1."
"okay, jim. we're ready now to yaw another 90 degrees to the right."
roger.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
we are going to try to improve the comm and telemetry by temporarily breaking lock and re- acquiring. you may hear some noise in your heads et.
okay. couldn't be any more noise than we're getting now.
right.
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay. now that there's no noise, you can give ..."
"jim, i didn't copy that. your c0_4 is pretty good, though. how is it with us?"
"good. okay. 02 18 k0 07 cdr houston, do you want to reconfigure the down voice backup again?"
"aquarius, houston. i don't think so at this time. our voice is good now. how's yours?"
ours is very good.
"okay, why don't we stay where we are for a few minutes."
"okay. houston, aquarius. we're deadbanding in the new attitude."
"aquarius, houston. roger that, and your comm is good."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. in order to save on an amp or 2 of power here, we'd like you to go to the down voice backup comm configuration, which is pulling the power amd circuit breaker and going to down voice backup. if we get into a comm problem, all you have to do is reverse that configuration, and it should be good again. over."
"okay, we'll go to down voice backiip and pull the power ampl circuit breaker, and if we get into trouble, we'll com_ back again."
"okay, real fine, and we estimate the next yaw maneuver should start at about 68:02. over."
okay. could you give me that in minutes?
"i sure can. that's going to be in 29 minutes from now, jim."
okay. thank you.
okay.
"okay, houston. we're in down voice backup and the power amplifier is pulled."
"jim, houston. roger that. you are readable through the noise. how are we? over."

roger.
"joe, can you also get us an idea about how far out we can expect to make it on the command module batteries."
"okay, jack. it sounds as though we probably don't want to power up the command module before ei minus 2 hours. that doesn't mean we can't start our procedure a good deal before that, but we don't want to power it up much before ei minus 2. over."
okay. i was just thinking in case something - we had the sort of problem here about how we would go about getting in the command module ... we need to power up - and - in order to make it back into earth.

"go ahead, houston."
"roger, jim. we just thought of something; namely, that we probably should get the lithium hydroxide canisters out of the command module reasonably soon just to make certain that they don't stay in there and possibly swell up until they'd be hard to get out. i wouldn't wake up fred for that, but it's something you should do possibly before you go to sleep."

"okay, stand by."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay, we don't have a percise time for the starting of that procedure yet; we are working on it real hard. it won't be for several hours; and we'll pass it up to you just as soon as we get it. over."
"okay, and, joe, you want us to start a ptc maneu- ver at this time?"
stand by and i'll check.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"roger, jim. we would like the next yaw maneuver in about 6 minutes. over."
roger.
okay.
"oh, yes, yes. keep opening - open the jets slowly ... keep working at it."
is there some way that we could ... water in the plss.
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay. our estimate is that we will start power- ing up for the dps burn at about 76 hours elapsed, which is about 6-3/4 hours from now."
"roger, joe. understand."
"okay, joe, about 76 hours or so and i guess you misunderstood. my question was what was the get way back when, when i first came across to the i21 and transferred to lampower? how long have we been living on the lm, now?"
"oh; roger. stand by. i'll give you that. yes, i just didn't understand."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, the time of transfer to i_mpower was 57 hours, 11 minutes. for your information, we seem to be reasonably fat on power. in fact, we are looking at a procedure that we might recommend to you later on after the burn and so forth of powering up one of the command module main buses via the lm umbilical. this would enable us possibly to charge up the command module batteries. over."
"okay, joe. that sounds great. i just thought that to pass the time, i'd do a little backseat quarterbacking, here."
roger.
how's the water doing? apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."

"jim, that spacecraft's looking pretty close; a about 86 or ..."
"well, ..."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, fred. i have a few words for you on some things we want to do in the next few hours, and .....__ in order to get good comm for that and also in · order to give fido a few minutes of ranging, i want to have you put the power amplifier circuit breaker in panel 16 in, the voice function switch to voice, and ranging _jnction switch to ranging. over."
now i'm in normal voice and ranging is up.
"okay, fred. and you're loud and clear down hero now. okay. what we're getting a procedure ready for you is to do an aot sun check at approximate- ly 74 hours or in just a little over 3 hours. that will be a detent 2; we'll have a detail pro- cedure up shortly and it will include a rendezvous radar redesignation to get it out of the way and a p52 maneuver to the attitude. it's our feeling that if that checks out within 1 degree that your platform will be okay for the burn without a subsequent p52. if it's not within 1 degree, we are working up an earth/sun alinement procedure to aline the platform, and we'll have that up to you later. okay. assuming that the sun check is okay, we will then give you a star for a con- fidence check on the back side when you're in the darkness. we'll be updating a burn pad to you prior to los going around the moon. we'll have another look at you after aos, and we'll update the pad if required. right now that update should be very small. over. 02 22 54 48 _ okay. stand by 1."
"okay. joe. as i read that, at 74 hours we're going to do an a0t sun check at detent 2, which is going to require the rendezvous radar out of the way. and we use p52 auto maneuver to get there, or at least the angles out of that, and if this passes within 1 degree, you're saying the platform is okay for the maneuver, and we won't need a subsequent p52. but even if it is okay, you'll give us a star which we can use for our check when we're in darkness. if this check flunks, you'll pass us on up then an earth/mon aline procedure."
"okay, fred. that's correct, except the aline procedure that wetre working on is an earth/sun aline, and other than that, that's correct. incidentally, this tc plus 2 maneuver looks like it will still be around a 900-foot-per-second maneuver and that it will get you back to the mid-pacific line at 142 hours. 02 22 57 15 _mp okay. that was an earth/sun check, john. we're getting a little close to the moon now. and the tc plus 2 maneuver still looks about 900 foot per second to get us at mid-pac, at about 142 hours."
that's right.
"aquarius, houston. 02 23 05 19 _ go ahead, joe."
"ok_v, fred. we got a good batch of ranging and now we'd like you to reverse the configuration, ranging to off, voice function to down voice backup, power amplifier circuit breaker out; we'll be talking to you."
down voice backup with the power amp breaker open now. how do you read?
"we read you satisfactorily, fred. 02 23 05 53 i_p okay. 02 23 06 17 imp jim and jack are in the upstairs bedroom taking a nap now."
i didn't know that was upstairs. 02 23 06 34 imp _rehave the first space station.

"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"one other thing you might have somebody look at - i don't want to bother the guys upstairs - the drain hose that we've got in the command module, i wonder if we can find out if it will plug into the plss and in which case we can keep transfer- ring - later on at least - the command module water into the iavia the plss."
"okay, fred. you're almost up with us. we are looking real hard at getting water from the command module waste tank into the plss, using that hose and then dumping it from the plss into the lm ascent tank, and we think it is feasible; we're checking it out to make sure. 02 23 10 08 imp okay. 02 23 10 29 _ okay. i have time to do another maneuver here, joe."
"okay, fred. let me verify that."
"fred, houston. that is verified. you can go ahead with the yaw m_neuver."
"roger. apoli,0 13 air-to-ground voice transcri'fi(_"
"okay. just made another maneuver. we allowed for a little too much roll, there. i wonder if that's too much, or should i try to take it out now that i got it stopped."
"fred, this is houston. - -"
twenty degrees roll left - yes. all right; go ahead.
"okay, fred. i didn't copy the beginning of your message."
"okay, i - i was talking to jim, there."
sorry.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, joe."
"roger. listen, charlie duke wants to talk to you - to you about the a0t star check; and, so that we can have good comm, i'd like to recon- figure with the power amplifier circuit breaker in and the voice function switch to voice and while we're at it, we'd like the ranging function switch to ranging. over."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. over. 03 00 28 49 iap houston, aquarius."
"roger, fred-o. reading you - -"
"okay, houston, aquarius. go ahead."
"okay, fred-o. reading you 5-by. the procedure i'm going to read up to you is a sun check for the - to see if we're going to need an alinement or not. if you'll get out your g&n dictionary and open it to p52, page 34, we'll start at the bottom. over."
"okay. stand by 1. 03 00 29 32 iap sounds like you broke out, charlie. 'l'_e 48/?"
"yes, finally, fred-o. i've no longer got the red spots."
"okay. stand by, aquarius. we'll be back with you momentarily."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. you ready with your g&n dictionary? over."
"okay. i'm on page 34 now, looking at p52."
"okay, fred-o. at the bottom of the page, we want step 1, on the flashing 0406, we want an option 3, and that'll pull us over to 6; and, on the 5025, we want you to do the enter on the 5025, and that'll bring up flashing 0170, and load in ri 200. over."
"okay. let me see if i'm with you. we call up p52 and, on the flashing 0406, we pr0 on a 3 refsmmat which leads us to a flashing 5025. we enter on that. on the flashing 0170, we want to enter a 200."
"that's affirmative; and after that, you pro on that, and you come up with a flashing 0688, and we'll have to load noun 88. and if you're ready to copy, i have the sun half-unit vectors at 74 hours get. over."
okay. go ahead.
"okay. at sun half-unit vectors, x, ri, is plus 0.45498, y plus 19024, z plus 08250. over."
"okay. we pro on - after entering the 200. we'll get a flashing 0688. we then load the sun unit vectors for 74 hours, which are ri plus 5 - correction, plus 45498, r2 plus 19024, r3 plus 08250."
"roger. that's good, fred-o. and that'll bring you to step 8, and you get a flashing 5018 when you pro on the noun 88. okay. at 5018, we want to do an auto maneuver to - to the attitude, so just do the - the pro with the guidance control, pngs; mode control, pngs, auto; and we '11 take this attitude. now, that's going to put us at - at attitude for the sun check. now, we're being a 1.4-degree deadband in this program in a docked configuration; so, to help you out, you could call verb 62 to get your needles - and it - when the needles go through zero or null out and - in that deadband - then you take a look in the aot and see how close the sun is. and we want within plus or minus 1 degree. over."
"okay. so we pro on the noun 88, and we end up with a flashing 5018; and you want an auto maneuver here rather than using the ttca, so we pro with guidance, pngs; mode control, auto. we've got a 1.4-degree deadband with a verb 62 will give us the needles to try to zero them in and, at that time i look through the aot and, if it's like apollo 11 sun check, all we've got to have is the sun somewhere in the - out there somewhere on the sun as it passes. is that correct?"
"i think that's a little tight; that's about a quarter degree. we can go a little bit out of that. stand by 1. fred, we'll get you an answer on that one. and also, if you'll stand by, we'll give you a dap load for this maneuver. over."
okay. we'll - you'll give us a dap load.
roger. stand by.
"aquarius, houston. fred-o, on that - to pass that check, the sun is at - will septend an arc of one-half degree in the aot, so you can be two diameters off and still pass the check. over."
"okay. it's a half a degree, and so we can be two sun diameters off and still pass."
that's affirmative. and we want you to maneuver with a dap of 0.2 of a degree a second. over.
okay. you want us to use a dap of 0.2.
"okay. that dap load, fred-o, is 31120. over."
okay. 31120.
"roger. now, if we pass that check, you can just terminate p52 right there, and we'll give you an attitude to go to a burn attitude, and from this we can get a star check. if you don't pass, we'd like you to do an alinement at 75 hours. and, if you're ready to copy, we have some sun half-unit vectors and some earth half-unit vectors at 75 hours. over."
"stand by 1, charlie."
okay. go ahead for 75 hours - sun and earth half-unit vectors.
"roger. first with the sun; for x, plus 45483; for y, plus 19053; for zebra, plus 08262; earth half-unit vector at 75 hours, plus 32120, minus 34155, minus 17370. over."
"okay. sun half-unit vectors: ri plus 45483, r2 plus 19053, r3 plus 08262; earth half-unit vectors: ri plus 32120, r2 minus 34155, r3 minus 17370."
"roger, fred-o. good readback. now, on the earth, we estimate it - if you have to do this alinement, that the earth will be about a 2-degree earth. and it'll be approximately three-quarters lighted. now, to mark on the earth, we'd like you to take an imaginary line between the horns of the crescent and mark midway between the horns. over."
"okay. we got a 2-degree earth that's three- quarter lighted, and we're to imagine a line between the horns of the earth and mark right in the center of that line."
"that's affirmative. now, on - on this star check - correction, the sun check, fred, at - on the 5018, i got some fdai angles for you if you're ready to copy. over."
"okay. you're talking about the check at 74 hours get, right?"
"roger. okay. at 74 hours when you start this m_euver, the 5018 should look like ri of 2703 degrees, pitch r2 is 0903, and r3 of 2908. over."
"okay. how about making those all five digit readouts; read them again, charlie."
"okay. pardon me. it's 27030, 09030, 29080."
"okay. the 5018 should look like ri plus 27030, r2 plus 09030, r3 plus 29080."
"roger. that's good readback. now, we got one more procedure for you; and, right now, we got the rendezvous radar stowed and we won't be able to see anything out of detent 2, so we'd like you to position the radar to 0283; and we have a procedure for that. and we'd like you to do that right before you get the attitude. over."
okay. stand by.
okay. go ahead.
stand by. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice trai_scription
"aquarius, houston. on those 5018 angles we had at 74 hours, fred, that was based on a verb 49 to this attitude, and they will be incorrect for for the two axis maneuvers, so you can just scratch them. over."
"okay. you're saying the angles you gave me for the 5018, that was for a verb 49, so they won't be good for the 5018, and we should scratch them."
"thatts affirmative. okay. if you're ready to copy, i've got this rendezvous radar procedure. over."
okay. go ahead.
"okay. it's about a 10-stepper, but real easy. okay. on cb 16, eps inverter 2, close. cb 11, ac bus a bus tie inverter 2, close. panel 14, verify inverter switch 2. cb 11 rendezvous radar 2, close. rendezvous radar, release. rendezvous radar to lgc on panel 3. are you with me? over."
roger. i'm right up with you at step 6. go ahead.
"okay, fred. good show. step 6: verb 41 noun 72 enter, plus all balls, plus 28300. step 7: monitor movement with verb 16 noun 72. step 8: cb ll rendezvous radar 2, open. are you with me ? over. 03 o0 48 13 i_p stand by 1."
okay. go ahead now.
"roger. step 9 is a verb 44. step 10: cb 16, eps inverter 2, open. over. 03 00 48 53 i24p okay. i got it."
okay. 03 00 48 57 imp do you want me to read it back now?
"i got one more for you. youtll copy this and give me it all on the readback. okay. once you get the attitude and you want to use the - you want to get the a0t lamp, we got to go cb 16 eps inverter 2, close; cb 11, ac bus a a0t la_, close. after the p52, you can open cb 16 eps inverter 2, and open cb 11 ac bus a aot lamp and ac bus a bus tie inverter 2. over. 03 o0 50 01 imp okay. stand by 1. 03 00 51 10 _ okay. let's see if i got it all. for rendezvous radar parking: first of all we want cb 16 eps inverter 2, closed, cb 11 ac bus a bus tie inverter 2, closed. then on panel 14, verify inverter 2 selected. and cb 11 rendezvous radar 2 closed, both breakers. then we are to pull the rendezvous radar release handle. on panel 3, we then want rendezvous radar to lgc. a verb 41 noun 72 enter with plus all zips, plus 28300 in registers 1 and 2. go on that. then we monitor movement with the 16 72. after it gets parked, cb 11 rendezvous radar 2 open, followed by verb 44 enter. and cb 16 eps inverter 2 open. now, when it comes time for the alinement to get an aot lamp, cb 16, eps inverter 2 closed, cb ll ac bus a aot lamp closed, and after the alinement is completed at cb 16, eps inverter 2 open, cb 11 ac bus a a0t lamp open, cb 11 ac bus a bus tie inverter 2 open."
"good readbaek, aquarius. we'll - to get those needles on the verb 62, we got to power up the commander's fdai. we'll have that procedure for you shortly. over."
okay.
"charlie, jim here."
roger. go ahead.
have you run a earth set alinement in the simula- tor with a docked configuration?
"is the question, ""have we run a - an alinement in the docked configuration?"" that is affirmative."
"okay. did you have any trouble controlling the vehicle, and what techniques did you use?"
"briefly, to control pitch and roll, use the ttca, as we've practiced; for yaw you can use the aca. over."
okay. you have no special techniques going back and forth between the yaw and the x and y lines. over.
"not right now, jim. dave scott's been running these things and we'll get them up to you shortly. 0yer."
okay.
"we think the alinement's going to be okay, so we don't have to do this p52 fullup alinement. we think the check is going to be okay. like to remind you since you are in att- if check does not pass, since you are in attitude for the sun, that we'd - we want the sun half-unit vectors first. over."
roger. understand.
0kay_ houston. it's been over an hour since we did our last ptc. you want us to do another one now?
stand by 1. over.
"aquarius, houston. we'd like you to go ahead and yaw 90 for the ptc. keep a close eye out on your middle gimbal angle. you're about 30 degrees from gimhal lock, and we'll call you an omni switch halfway through the maneuver. over."
roger.
"okay. and, houston, aquarius. you might know when you've had enough ranging so we can get the power amp back off again."
"roger, fred-o. we got one more procedure, and we can shut it down, and that's to get the needles and the fdai for this maneuver. that 5018 could take you to gimbal lock, and we think it's tape 4914 a good idea to power up the commander's ball. we've got a four-stepper, if you're ready to copy. over. 03 01 00 15 irp okay, go ahead."
"okay. verify that you got ac power, in other words, the inverter 2 selected and the bus tie inverter 2 ac bus a closed. we'll be under flight displays, gasta closed, commander fdai, closed. on the ac bus a, cbs gasta closed, conbiander fdai closed. over."
"okay. it's verify we have ac, which is panel 16 inverter 2 closed. cb inverter 2 closed. then on panel ll under flight displays, we want the gasta and the commander's fdai breakers closed. also under panel ll, ac bus a gasta and commander's fdai breakers closed."
that's affirmative. over.
"aquarius, houston. after the omni switch, we would like you to get the ranging off, the voice switch to down voice backup, and the power amp cb on 16 open. over. 03 01 02 31 imp okay. after the omni switch, we'll get the power amp off and go back to down voice backup fta and the ranging off. it's your call."
roger. stand by.
"fred-o, we got about 2 minutes to the omni switch. you can go ahead and power the ranging down and and the down voice backup, and we'll give you a call on omni switch. over. 03 01 03 09 imp okay. 03 01 03 19 _ how do you read aquarius now on down voice backup?"
"roger, aquarius. we are reading you about the same, about 2-by. 03 01 03 34 imp okay."
"aquarius, houston. select forward 0mni. over. 03 01 04 26 imp ..."
roger.
"do you read down there, houston?"
"apollo 13, houston. we read you weakly. go ahead."
"okay. vance, if buzz or neil are around you might ask them if they had to use the aot lamps to shoot the sun like they did on ll."
"well, where's the ... 03 01 09 34 _ right down below me here?"
"fred, breaking in. you're very weak. understand if buzz or nell are down here, you'd like to ask them if they used the aot lamp to what? over."
"to see the sun, vance. it might be possible to see the reticle without even having the light on."
"oh, i see. see if it's possible to see the reticle without the light on. okay. we'll make a check. and one other thing, you might move that rendezvous radar antenna to park any time now. you can start any time you want."
okay.
... it's out of the way.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, vance."
"jim, neil is here. he advises that you will not need the lamp on for the sun check but that you will need it on for the earth check. over."
understand.
okay. let's park the radar. are you ready?
"okay. let me - first of all, let me see how we're doing here. that 's going down. that 's better. that 's coming up. that 's right. let 's - okay. let's park the radar. how - how long is it going to take? 03 01 11 48 imp not too long. okay, inverter 2 ... here, hold the light for me, jim. right here on the ... panel. hold it still .... ac bus a bus tie."
okay.

"okay. on cb 11, give me the rendezvous radar breakers, with 30-second spread."
"okay .... at 15, i ..."
okay .... 30 seconds.
okay. go ahead.
right.
okay. thirty seconds. ac breaker.
okay. got a big dip.
okay. reach up here and give me the ... panel i.!
okay. she's pulled.
"okay. panel 3, check the lgc."

it's going now .... signal light. 03 01 14 15 imp right.
... is running away. docking light. 03 01 14 26 imp what?
command module docking light. okay. you got them. they're in.
"okay. two rendezvous radar breakers, pull them. i.. .,."
...
cb 16 inverter 2 open.
okay.
you know that light on the command module ...?
"apollo 13, houston. over."
... get that thing ...
roger. one correction. we think that the cheapest way for you to maneuver to change attitude is with minimum pulse aca. that's to do the star mark.
we had - okay. as soon as possible we'll get that star data ... we can get to maneuver attitude by using ttca.
roger.
"and, just out of curiosity, we got rid of the radar very nicely. it's hanging right in the middle of the - the forward digit is the docking light on the command module. can you believe that? i don't think it will hurt our sun check, but it'll sure make p52 ..."
"sorry, jim, but we are only reading you about lby 1. 03 01 16 56 irp look at that big ... out there."
... out there.
it looks like a piece of wrapping for ... line.
you're watching that. right?
it's going to get smaller before it gets larger.
okay. i guess they can close it.
okay. did you read your figures ...? 03 o1 22 06 _ yes.
okay.
okay .... p22. what's our next time line? 03 o1 22 50 irp about 73:30 ...
did you get that or did he give it to you? 03 01 23 58 _ he gave it to me.
"okay. because i thought he said 2 degrees per second. like to check on that. 03 01 24 09 irp okay, houston; aquarius."
"go ahead, fred."
okay. jim thinks he heard s_nething different than i copied on the dap load. is register 1 supposed to be 311207
"that's correct, fred. that was to be 31120."
okay.
okay.
"and, houston, how do you want us to ..."
"... 3, 2, c and d, 2, 2, 0, ... okay. we're at high bit rate."
okay .... give ... a call.
"well, they probably dcm't know what to do there."
"okay. and, houston; vance."
"go ahead, jim."
just want to get a time check with you. when do you want us to start powering up the ball? we just got to out ptc attitude.
understand you'd like to know when to power up the -
we think to take about 15 - -
...
"yes. the ball inside the maneuver, we think it will take us about 15 minutes to get there. we'd like you to confirm that."
stand by 1.
... god damn ...
what would that take to use ... use the command module or what? to load the plss ...
"...... let's see, about l0 or ll ..."
when is that sun check time supposed to take place? 03 01 31 32 i24p 74 hours 29 minutes ...
"okay, houston; aquarius. i'd just like to do the little sun check. do you want me to do it now?"
"jim, roger. we just came up with a maneuver time of approximately 15 minutes, so if you start any time between now and about the next 2 minutes it would get you into attitude by 73:15. over."
roger. we'll start the maneuver at this time. okay. let's go.
okay. sps ... - -
"if we don't keep working, we'll never develop it."
"... now, power up your fdi."
all right.
okay. give me 16 ... apparently .... panel ll ...
yes.
... gasta.
okay.
and commander fdi.
okay.
"and on your ha, yaw right side, lift main line ... ..."
okay.
now ... 30 second ... okay. now let's get ready to run this back ....
okay.
okay. deadband option.
okay .......
"okay.... on this ... vector. okay, r1 plus 45498 ... okay, plus 190 ..., plus 08256. okay, now we show zips ... okay. verb 62 enter. okay. ... and the main ... in auto ......"
"houston, are you monitoring our p52 technique?"
- - apollo 13 - -
"roi1, yaw, roll, pitch, and yaw."
"jim, that's negative. we don't have any data on you. low bit rate."
we don't have high bit rate.
"houston, do you read aquarius?"
"roger. reading you, fred. go ahead."
go ahead. houston is reading you.
"houston, aquarius."
reading you loud and clear. go ahead. 0b 01 37 14 cdr are you monitoring our p52 technique?
"that's negative, jim. we do not have high bit rate data on you now. over. 0b 01 37 28 cdr okay. thank you. 03 01 37 b0 cc roger."
"and be advised, vance, that we are getting several echos in our comm downlink here."
roger. we'll check into it.
"...... and ... alinement. 0b 01 38 04 cc apollo lb, houston."
"go ahead, houston. 0b 01 38 12 cc jim, request you give us high bit rate now. we might be able to fix you up on the 120 antenna. 0b 01 38 21 cdr okay. high bit rate."
roger.
"and, zero, zero, zero."
"yes. 0b 01 39 20 cc apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"fred, we can't lock up on your high bit rate. request you go back low bit rate."
"hey, we lost you there, vance."
"roger. advise, we are not locking up on your high bit rate, so you can go back low bit rate. over."
low bit rate.
"right here, jim. there it is. looks like it ..."
i don't have all the confidence in the world in this earth-sun p52.
you know how many times i screwed up on my arithmetic.
yes. don't count your chickens before they hatch.
"listen, i'm not."
"we're ... going to be two diameters out, huh?"
yes.
"okay. tell me what that technique is to get the lamp on, in case i don't see it."
"they'll have to give you ac again and you punch in your breaker -well, let's see - i've still got hp on for the fdis, so you're in business now. all you need is the lamp breaker, the ac bus a aot lamp breaker, that is."
let me know when these start going. there's the sun. give me the - give me the aot.
okay.
"never mind. i don't need it. go ahead. i got it. never mind. 03 o1 44 16 _ reticle brightness, want it up? got the reticle?"
i got the reticle ...
"... call it, jack; you can see it better."
...
okay.
......
... we got it a great big one.
yes. i show it about maybe a third of a diameter to the left.
okay. take a look.
"check your needles. you're off in roll, jim."
"pitch and yaw are in, but wetre off in your roll needle. better get that ..."
okay. it brings it in. say when.
okay. we got it. i think we got it. what diameter was it?
yes. it's coming back in. just a second.
"yes, yawts coming back in."
just about it.
okay. yaw is in ...
what have you got?
... upper right corner of the sun.
we've got it.
you're hot ...
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius. 0b 01 47 05 cdr okay. it looks like the sun check passes."
"we understand it checks out. we're kind of glad to hear that. 0b 01 47 17 cdr it's not quite centered, but it's about a diameter, a little bit less than a diameter, just to one side."
sounds good.
now. let's get the aot lamp on.
"oki, jim."
which ... to get the aot lamp on?
okay. pull the - your aot lamp breaker.
got it.
"okay. and, houston, can we proceed with our powerdown now? getting the ball back off and aot lamp, et cetera, ac secured."
"stand by on that one for a minute, fred."
"- - the ball ... get back to - okay. what we'd like now, i guess, is the next attitude to go to, vance, and we will work on getting there while we still have the ball. 0b 01 48 21 cc roger. we copy."
...
"okay. seventy-four hours. 0b 01 49 14 lmp yes. we're not there yet, really. i've got ll minutes to check ... out."
yes. bring your ... down.
get set. keep ... it's better in here. slow now ...
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"jim, in a moment we will have an attitude for you to go to, and recommend that you keep your fdi up while maneuvering to that attitude. after you get there, then we will have you widen the dead- band and eventually go into a ptc about the burn attitude."
"you were cut off slightly, vance."
roger. we will have an attitude for you to maneuver to in a moment. and you should leave your fdi up for that. the attitude is as follows if you are ready to copy. over.
got the book.
"go ahead, vance."
"okay. this is fdai attitudes for the maneuver. yaw 060 degrees, pitch 083 degrees, roll 272 de- grees."
"let's not read that in the r1, r2. i don't want verb 69 twice. i want verb 49, 58g's so i can fly the needle."
jim. those are not verb 49 angles. those are strictly fdai attitudes. over.
"okay. i understand, vance. it's much easier if the ball is up to fly the needles; that gives me a drift of verb 49, 58g maneuver. we could fly that manually."
stand by. we'll try to get you a verb 49 angle.
flying on maneuvers.
...
"on that last check, what did it look like?"
.........
this is the first three-man lm we've had.
"apollo 13, houston."
"and, vance, which - what hack you got now on get?"
"okay. stand by on that, fred. first, let me read up your verb 49 attitude, if you are reazly to copy."
go ahead.
"okay. yaw 27100, pitch 35500, roll 33000. over."
ask him if you keep it in auto maneuver there.
"okay. verb 49, yaw plus 27100, pitch plus 35500, roll plus 33000. and do you think it's cheaper to manually make that maneuver or take the 0.2- degree range and go in auto maneuver?"
"fred, we're recommending auto maneuver. over."
"okay. auto maneuver, and could you give me a get right now."
okay. i understand you want get of the burn. stand by 1.
"that's negative, vance. what is you clock read- ing right now? 03 oi 58 14 cc okay. when i give you a hack, it will be 73:59, and that's about 40 seconds away."
okay. i think we will make one last check there with the half-unit vectors for 74 hours before we leave this attitude.
okay. and i 'm going to calculate in the 2 sec- onds in giving you the time hack coming up on 73:59:00 when i give the mark. okay. stand by.
mark.
looked good.
okay. i understand you got it.
"you want me to proceed one more time on that, jack?"
"roger. yes, go ahead."
"oh, it's on; it's a center."
"that's it, she's right on still. okay. i have, too. that's better than i expected."
okay. let's do a verb 74 and get out of here.
if we can. go to po0? okay. i'm going to go to -
...
"737100. roger. 35500, plus 33000 ...."
okay. that's - -
"yaw, pitch, and roll."
"let me see. no, that's yaw, pitch, and - okay. everything's ...... that's roll, pitch, and yaw. 03 02 01 29 _ roll, pitch, and yaw."
everything ... yaw.
"the roll's going to be down here, but the yaw will be off the bellyband .... procedure, or don't you have a procedure?"
"roll, pitch, and yaw, but drift's the one. that would be gimbal lock if it wasn't for being off ..."
"and, houston, i see that this maneuver gives us a roll of 27172, a pitch of 08301. is that what they gave us?"
this is houston. please repeat.
"houston, did you give us verb 49 in yaw, pitch, and roll, or register 1, 2, and 3?"
"we gave it as yaw, pitch, and roll."
"okay. we wrote it as roll, pitch, and yaw."
"okay, jim. we read it to you as yaw, pitch, and roll, and we should have given it to you registers l, 2, and 3; but we did not. so register i is 33000, register 2 is 35500, and register 3 is 27100."
"okay, vance. register 1 will be 33000, register 2 35500, register 3 27100."
"hey, fred? stand by on that."
okay. plus 27100. okay. stand by. right now you can enter ...
"okay. apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, jim. we sorted it out, and it is correct the way we gave you the first time. so, r1 27100, and in the lm, that's yaw; r2 35500, and that's pitch; r3 33000, and that's roll in the lm. over."
"i agree with you. okay. 5018, it's there, and 5018, and that's what it will be. okay."
that's right. that's verb 49.
"there are 25. 25, enter."
"okay. plus 27100, plus 35500, plus 33000."
okay.
so far we're ... what can we do about it?
"apollo 13, houston. you better watch that middle gimbal. over."
"roger. we're watching that middle gimbal. we have as a roll, 27172. our yaw is - that's register 3 - 3300. how did we get this?"
"and, apollo 13. we have a procedure for you describing how to widen the deadbaud to 5 de- grees later on. but stand by for that."
"apollo 13, you're heading for gimbal lock. you better stop everything."
"yes, we're back in att hold now. we're trying to stop it."
roger.
i'm going to roll it.
"can you give it a roll up now, jim?"
yes.
i don't understand why we got that.
"apollo lb, houston. it looks like verb 49 maneuver will just take you right through there. you're going to have to go around it. over."
okay. that's what we're in the process of doing.
"si, si."
"we're manually working our way around it, vance."
okay.
pitch is 083.
"how do i work my way around it? i'm 58g's, and i want yaw 231, right? i think they screwed up o_ our - our numbers again."
"zero out the needles; we're heading that way, and then we'll stop and talk about it."
"no. pitch is 83. pitch should be up here. ...... what's the number, 552?"
pitch should be 83 degrees ....
"roll 232; that's a long way to roll, ... yaw is 62 ..."
... yaw.
... roll.
...
okay. what's that read; there's 180.
roger.
"... is over here. houston, 13."
"go ahead, 13."
there's something screwed up on our burn attitude. we're not getting the proper readings on the ball and the needles are centered. i'm not too sure what's wrong. let's go through this procedure again.
okay. stand by 1. let us look at it.
"- - angles you gave us, vance, aren't correlating the verb 49 numbers."
okay. we'll check into it.
we know the ball is good. why don't we just get a 40?
you better watch out; it's heading that way.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. to answer your last question, do you have pgns checklist page 57 handy?"
"right, we do. i'll check it."
"as soon as you open up to that, i'll explain it."
"okay. go ahead, vance."
"okay. under verb 49, crew-defined maneuver, the flashing 0622 are the aagles that we gave you that were loaded. the flashing 5018 actually represents fdai angles, and so what you read on 5018 should - - ta_e 1_9/20 t_age 294"
hight. i understand. 0b 02 17 06 cc - - should not correspond with noun 22.
"yes. we appreciate that, vance. it's just that right now we're trying to follow center needles that appear to be possibly taking us away from the place we know we want to be in the ball. ob 02 17 bh cc okay, you're tending toward the gimbal lock area again. heads up. 0b 02 17 42 lmp roger."
"there's our 83. - - 0b 02 18 36 cc apollo 13, houston. ob 02 18 41 cdr/lmp go ahead. 0b 02 18 lb cc lb, request you put in the power ampl circuit breakers so that we eau take a look at your angles. ob 02 18 54 lmp you got it."
thank you. and now high bit rate. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription
"okay, 13; wetre getting your high bit rate now and taking a look at your angles."
"apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, jim, we just took a look at your angles, and you're looking good here. your pgns is looking good. we can't yet explain the attitude error needle thing, but i suggest you continue on in your maneuver."
roger. okay. we've just about got roll.
"lb, houston. we see you now in the auto maneuver. how are your error needles looking now?"
"okay. they look like they are working their way in, vance."
okay. you think maybe they are working right now?
"yes. because we got a 270-degree roll, our pitch and yaw needles are reversed."
"okay. 03 02 27 22 imp say, how do you read, vance? ..."
"fred, you are starting to fade out. request aft omni, omni aft. 03 02 27 37 imp okay. you've got aft omni."
thank you.
"13, houston."
"okay, houston; aquarius. we appear to be there - at the burn attitude. and now do you want us to change the dap?"
"roger, jim. we have a procedure to give you for widening the deadb_u/d to 5 degrees for the ptc in the next 3 or 4 hours, if youtre ready to copy."
"okay, stand by."
go ahead.
"okay. verb 21, noun 01, enter; 3011, enter; 44, enter. now, that's the procedure for widening the deadband to 5 degrees with the dap. later on, prior to the burn, you would return the deadband to 1.4 degrees, and if you're ready to copy, i'll read you that."
stand by.
okay.
go ahead.
"okay. to return the deadband later to 1.4 degrees: verb 21, noun 01, enter; 3011, enter; 200, enter. over. 03 02 31 03 lamp okay, vance. to widen the deadband, we'll enter a verb 21, noun 01, enter; 3011, enter; 44, enter. before the burn to go back to narrow deadband, it's verb 21, noun 01, enter; 3011, enter; 200, enter."
"roger, readback correct."
"and, houston, i'll guess we'll do this ptc in yaw, and do you want them all powered down?"
stand by.
"okay, apollo 13. over."
go ahead.
"okay, that's affirm. you'll be doing the ptc in yaw, and we'll give you a call at each time you change yaw - yaw attitude. aside from that, request low bit rate off; then down voice backup off; then power ampl off; and then fda off."
"okay, vance. on the power down, we go low bit rate; down voice backu', we'll pull the power ampl breaker; and we'll power down the _1)i and the ac."
"that's affirm. and the aot, too."
"okay, arc you all set for old a - 03 02 35 02 i_p okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read down voice backup?"
"reading you loud - loud and clear now, fred."
okay.
"oh, vance, do you want to stay in this attitude for a certain length of time before we start maneuvering?"
"roger. jim, we'll keep you there for about an hour, and then we'll have our first 90-degree rotation."
okay. how wide do i make the deadband?
say again.
... the other omni's ina 03 02 37 27 imp yes. my forward omni is in.
"apollo 13, houston. forward omni should be best."
we're there.
i dontt see why the hell he ...
i know. i don't know. i don't know where that 5 degrees ...
cut it.
_..
oh-h .... that thing against the ...
i'm just going to try and close my eyes for a little.
go ahead.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"fred, one - one point on the ptc requests that, about an hour or less from now when you make your 90-degree change, that you do it in pgns auto as opposed to att hold. reason is that if you're in att hold, it establishes a new null point each time you stop the - the maneuver. over. 03 02 51 10 _ okay. you want us to make the maneuver with pgns auto rather than the pgns att hold. is that right?"
yes. that's correct.
"and, fred, advise that it - it is a manual maneuver."
"13, houston. you'd be using x-axis override. it will be a manual maneuver, but with the pgns auto mode. 03 02 52 07 i_p okay."
"and if you're ready to copy, charlie is going to be on in a minute with some recommended check- list changes for your upcoming burn. over."
okay. stand by 1.
i'm going to erase this.
"hello, aquarius; houston. do you read? over."
yes. stand by 1 ...
"okay. which book are you going to give me some words in, charlie? 03 02 54 04 imp houston, aquarius. which book do you want us to have out? contingency ...?"
"houston. this is houston, aquarius. say again. over."
"houston, aquarius. which book do you want me to update here, charlie, the contingency qr dps?"
"okay, fred-o, we'd like you to get out the contingency checklist; turn to page 1, the 2-hour activation. over. 03 02 54 5 lmp okay. i'm right there."
"okay. on page 1, the only thing we have to do is eps activation, step 2, cb(16) eps: display, close. over. 03 02 55 18 i24p okay. on page 1, we need eps display, close, under eps activation, step 2."
"okay. turning over to page 2, we'd like you to complete step 5 and step 6 with the following changes. power/t_4p monitor, ac bus, inverter 2, then inverter 1. fourth line cb(ii), eps: inverter 2, open. over."
"okay, on step number - or page 2, we should do step 5 and modify step 6 second line to read inverter 2, then inverter 1, to the last line of step 6 cb(ii), eps inverter 2, open."
"okay. that will be on cb(16), fred-o, but it's inverter 2 open. okay, on the mission timer activation. do step 1, correction, lines 1 and 2. omit ""set mission timer on csm mark"" and insert a verb 16, noun 65, set mission timer. over."
"okay. we'll do the mission timer activation except we'll set it on verb 16, noun 65."
"okay. proceeding on to step, correction, page 3, cwea checkout. step 1, perform step 1. warning lights will be ascent press, ces ac, and ces dc. under the caution lights, we may have a heater light. and that' s all. okay, perform - under the circuit breaker 16 - -"
i can't understand you. i'll switch om_is.
say again. over.
"i'm going to switch to omnis here, charlie, you're starting to fade out."
"understand. switching omnis. over. 03 02 58 02 _ okay. how do you read? ..., how do you read me now?"
"okay, you're a little better. how me? over. pa_e 300 03 02 58 14 l_4p okay, louston. coming in loud and cl,_ar.  got your caution/warning checkout, step 1, do; the warning lights we'll have will be ascent press, ces ac, ces dc. the only caution lights we may have will be a heater light and go ahead and proceed from there."
"okay, good. the component light, we won't have the h20 sep. okay, on cb(16) right under that, ""heater display, close,"" you can scratch that out. perform all of step 2 and perform step 4 with the following changes. on panel ll, under ac bus b, are you ready to copy? over."

roger. now stand by 1.
okay. hand me the eyepiece. i got scorpio.
you have?
yes. and antares_
where's the other one? i'i put _t baok _n here.
"hello, aquarius. houston. on activation page 16, if you are ready. over. 03 03 10 41 iafp okay. stand by just 1, charlie. jim's going to fish around and see if he's got - he thinks he's got scorpio. i'm the aot now. okay, charlie, go ahead. i'm on 16 now."
"okay. fred. on page 16, perform the ""docked dps burn (pgns),"" that entire sequence down - down through the end of the page, except cross out that ""csm maneuver to burn attitude, then cmc - free."" over. q3 03 11 27 iap yes. i kind of deduced that one, charlie. forget the csm maneuver."
"okay. and you can forget the ""aps follow-up,"" too. okay, on page 17, perform all of the ags entries and at 4 minutes, we got a change. first line, cb(16) inverter 3, close; line 2, scratch out ""select inverter 1."" at -proceeding on down the page, after ""attitude monitor,"" we'd like you to place the t,%tescale to ""25 degrees a second."" okay, proceeding on down four more lines to ""balance couple,"" we'd like to turn ""balance couple-off."" that's to keep the upfiring jets off of the csm, in case we have to damp any rates in ags, though we don't think we will. then perform the rest of that page as written. over."
"okay, on page 17. do the ags load at minus 4 minutes; it's cb(ii), inverter 2, close, and scratch ""select inverter 1."" rate scale changed to ""25 degrees a second."" ""balance couple,"" we'll turn ""off;"" and, incidentally, on the ags dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion we'd had before, charlie, on takeovers. you might discuss what it's going to cost us delta-v- wise, if we get a control problem, to just shut her off and it take 30 ninutes to regroup for a good manual burn."
"fred, we already got that story for you, pretty well in hand. we're reviewing it right now. and i'd like to defer that question until later on. basically, we're just going to shut down and take what we got, and we got a midcourse of about - the maximum of 5 foot per second, anywhere in the burn to get back to free return. that - thatts basically the story. we'll give you the mission rules for this burn momentarily. i'd like to proceed on to page 18, at minus 1 minute, scratch ""master arm - on."" stand by. 03 03 14 07 i24p okay, on page 18, and i've already done that at 1 minute; ""master arm - on,"" i'll scratch - -"
"- - slipped that ... and i won't have anything to do - - 0b 03 14 15 izmp - - i've already scratched ""cb(16) abort stage - close"" for the previous burn."
okay. we want you to close the cb(16) abort stage. over.
okay. you got some special reason for that?
"yes, sir. we like - in case we don't get a manual on - i mean, an auto on, we're going to back up using the abort stage in the descent- engine command override at ignition plus 1 second. backing up to page 17, at minus 4 minutes, you read ""cb(ii) inverter 2,"" it should be ""cb(16) inverter 2."" over."
"okay, i got you, charlie. 17, ""cb(16) inverter 2, close."""
"okay, back to page 18. we'll continue on as is at 30 seconds, l0 seconds, 7 seconds, minus 5 seconds. at ""ignition,"" no ignition and we'll add here, ""no ignition, start pushbutton - push; still no ignition, descent engine command override, on."" over."
"i got it out there, but i can't get to see it closer."
"okay, on channel - on rage 18, right on down the line, everything holds until after ""ignition""; ""if no ignition, start puskbutton -push; still no ignition, descent en3ine command override switch on."""
"okay, good readback, fred-o. at plus 15 seconds, scratch ""master arm - off;"" and at - proceeding on down to ""at engine cutoff,"" it's - after the ""mode control: pgns to att hold,"" we'd like a ""verb 76,"" and the ""damp excessive rates via the lm y, z translation."" over. 03 03 16 48 _ okay, scratch ""master arm - off"" at plus 15, and ""at engine cutoff"" after ""mode control: pgns - att hold,"" we want a ""verb 76 enter,"" and ""damp excessive rates via lm y, z translation."" and a question on the - propellant quantity, we expect it to get down below 37 percent on this burn. does that compare with that burn time when you get down to it."
"that's negative. at this - this burn, we're looking at - not reaching 37 percent, so i don't think wetll have to perform that step. we will verify that for you. okay. one other statement: ""at engine cutoff, if manual start, then at 30 feet per second to go, throttle to 40 percent. at delta-v equals zero, stop push- button, push."" over. 03 03 18 1t lmp okay, charlie. if a manual start, that was throttle to 40 percent at - was that 30 foot per second to go?"
that's affirmative. at 30 foot per second to go. 03 03 18 30 i_p okay. then it's stop pushbutton at vgo equals zero?
"thatts affirmative. what we want to do, if we got a manual start, we're going to have to shut down manually, and, to get a better guided cut- off at 30 foot per second to go, we want you to throttle at 40 and acceleration is within reason there, and we feel like we can get a good manual cut-off. 0ver. 03 03 18 56 _mp okay."
"okay. now, fred, that was good in the checklist. that's all. we'll have the powerdown checklist for you momentarily, and we'd like to ask you if you plan to use the dps burn card. if you do, we have some changes to that. over."
okay. let me get ahold of this ... right now.
let me know when you are ready to copy. over.
i'm ready.
"okay. the first two lines are okay. cb - third line, cb(ii) and (16): stab/control, all closed except cb(il) aea, open; abort stage, open; aeld, open. cb(16) aeld, open. over."

we really don't use this card at that tlme. 'rape 50/13 rage 307
"roger, freed-c,. now we ar_m't - also al minus 30 seconds, we aren't lookirjg at an ags burn so you can scratch ""abort pushbutton, push,"" and at delta-v equal to zero, scratch ""abort pushbutton, reset."" 0ver."
"okay. minus 30 for ags burn, ""abort pushbutton, push"" is scratched, and at delta-v equals zero, ""abort pushbutton, reset"" is scratched."
"okay, you got it, babe. we'll have some mission rules for you momentarily, and the powerdown checklist and also a ptc setup. over. 03 03 23 24 i_p okay."
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim. over."
"roger. be advised i'm now seeing antares and nunki in the aot, and i just wanted to know whether you want me to try to do a p52."
roger. stand by. we copy the stars you are seeing. stand by on a p52.
"not very far apart. put the card back up, jim - - 03 03 24 ot cdr it's better than antares and shaula. 03 03 24 05 iap yes. sure is. that's right."
we got pretty good ... i'll do an auto p52 to antares. that's the way i'll get it up there.
"hey, houston - correction -aquarius, houston. we're satisfied with our present alinement. we don't want you to waste any more rcs gas trying to do this p52, and be advised you guys are hot mike, if you haven't heard. over."
"okay, understand."
"how's your memory there, charlie?"
"okay, we're putting vance back on. stand by."
what was that - -
"okay, okay, letts go back to that p52 ... now the attitude. 03 03 25 26 irp the burn attitude?"
"yes. i want to make sure i got it. 03 03 25 30 i//p oh, you strayed off?"
yes. 03 03 25 34 imp okay .... okay. you want these numbers? or do you want the numbers from these.
what? 03 03 25 48 _ pads. you got the g&n dictionary?
i got 13 20 going now. 03 03 25 57 imp wait a minute.
... just a ... these are those 13 20 angles here. up here. right here.
"hey, great. 03 03 27 20 i/4p one on. and houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, fred. 03 03 27 32 imp oh, about how long we got before we're going to have to go to work here, vance. kind of like to get a bite to eat, maybe."
"okay. we have a - a couple of pads to give you and stand by. let's - we'll check to see if we have anything else. 03 03 27 56 imp hold on to that, baby. where's that g&n book? you got it over there?"
"here we go. here, you want me to start copying - - 03 03 28 06 irp - - ... the bag - -"
- - off there.
"aquarius, houston. 03 03 28 11 _ no, you've got it right here."
go ahead.
"okay. about all we have to do is to send up your state vectors and target loads, and that will have to wait a couple of minutes until we get ready to do so. and if you're ready to copy, i can give you the p30 maneuver pad for pc plus 2, and after that, probably you should eat and then we'll regroup again to send up other things. over."
"okay. i'm ready to copy a p30, a pc plus 2."
"okay. okay, this is a preliminary p30 lm maneuver pc plus 2. starting noun 33: 079:27:40.07; plus 0819.2, minus 0020.0, minus 0218.9; na; plus 0020.9, 0848.2; 420, 274, 082; plus 0820.3, minus 0020.0, minus 0215.0. comments. ullage is two jets for 10 seconds. csm weight, 62480. lmweight 33576. and the following is the dps throttle profile: 5 seconds at minimum followed by 21 seconds at 40 percent, and the remainder at max. over. 03 03 31 21 iamp okay. pc plus 2. 079:27:40.07; plus 0819.2, minus 0020.0, minus 0218.9; na; plus 0020.9, 0848.2; 420, 274, 082; plus 0820.3, minus 0020.0, minus 0215.0; the rest n/a. under remarks: ullage, two jets 10 seconds; csm weight 62480; lm weight 33576. dps throttle profile: 5 seconds at idle; 21 seconds at 40 percent; remainder at max."
"roger; that's correct, fred. if you'll take out a maneuver pad, i'll give you some landing information. over."
"okay, you're talking in the csm update book?"
"yes, that's affirm."
you got it right here. make sure and scratch the ... - -
... - - 03 03 33 20 imp - - though.
"okay, which - which one we want? p377"
"what kind of a maneuver pad do you want, vance?"
"this is a csm maneuver pad for - to monitor pc plus 2. and it's going to be mainly blank except i want to give you your noun 61 latitude and longitude range to go for the ms and that sort of thing. 03 03 34 15 i_p okay, go ahead."
"okay, at the top, purpose is monitor pc plus 2; everything is blank until you get down to noun 61. latitude as follows: minus 21.47, minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, 142:39:20. over. 03 03 35 07 _ okay, monitor pc plus 2 pad. noun 81: minus 21.47, minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, 142:39:20."
"roger; that's correct, fred-o. and we - now would like to get you in a configuration to uplink your state vector and target load. so, if you're ready to copy, i have some circuit breaker changes for you. over. 03 03 35 47 _ okay, go ahead."
"okay, circuit breaker panel 11 updata link, close; primary power ampl, panel 16, close; voice function to voice; range - hanging function to ranging; tm bit rate, hi; and then p00 and data. 03 03 36 28 _ okay, we're now in po0 and data, and switches and breakers are configured. you got it."
"okay, thank you. you're coming in loud and clear."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"hey, jim, i have about three things. first thing, the computer is yours again. the second thing, no ptc maneuvering will be required from now until burn, so you can .lustsit in the b_zrn attitude. and the third thing is we'd like to back out of this procedure we just put you into to updata link, which would mean going from qtm bit rate hi back to lo, ranging to off, voice to down voice, primary power ampl to close."
"hold up, vance."
okay.
"we have a program alarm, vance. 1106."
stand by- - 03 03 44 39 izfp - - that high bit rate.
"okay, that apparently was just my putting the updata link switch off that set that bit."
"roger. we concur on that. and i'll read this back to you a little more slowly, fred."
"okay, are you ready to copy?"
okay. go ahead.
"okay. tm bit rate to lo; ranging to off, voice to down voice, primary power ampl to off - that's on panel 16 - and - or open - and circuit breaker ll updata link to close - or to open. over."
"okay, vance, how do you read on down voice backup now?"
"okay, fred, reading you loud and clear now. 03 03 46 26 _ okay. i've got the power ampl off, down voice backup, pcm to lo bit rate, and the updata link breaker on ll is pulled."
"okay. copy. thank you. 0b 03 47 16 cc apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. on this last readback, we'd just like to verify that the primary power ampl was pulled opened. over. 03 0b 47 b7 imp that's affirm. i used the breaker on 16, primary s-band power ampl breaker is open."
"okay. thank you. 03 0b 49 00 cdr boy, we must be getting pretty close to the moon. 03 03 49 03 imp what's that?"
"itts in a att hold. 03 03 49 21 imp five degrees. 03 03 50 24 imp hey, jack. bring me down one of the ... 03 03 50 37 imp and ..."
"... need two of them, i guess ... 03 03 50 49 imp ..."
"yes. i've been meaning to tell you about that, yes."
you know where this ... water?
what's that?
you know where this ... water?
where?
the lgc. 03 03 51 18 1amp ...
...
... there she is ... apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription
pretty close? how's the hoses coming?
that screen goes - goes on - fred's hose up there.
"yes. here, take that one .... another few minutes ..."
let's not forget to haul these out of here.
thank you.
get the hose screens?
yes.
i'll ...
"houston, aquarius. how do you read?"
"hello, houston; aquarius. how do you read?"
"aquarius, houston. loud and clear."
"okay. vance, i guess i understood you all were amassing a couple of - list of things that you were thinking about later on - we'd be taking back from the lm across into the csm. a couple of items to add to that list, we've pilfered the - the intake hose screens out of the csm and we have them mounted on the lm hoses now to catch the debris in here. we probably ought to take those back."
okay. we got that. intake hose screens.
"i guess that item isn't going to change your c.g. too much, fred-o."
let's hope not.
... command module water.
"yes. no, ... 03 03 58 59 iaip yes."
... get out one of those big ... bags.
much debris in there?
...
trying to put debris in?
yes.
... jim. ready to go.
how's that for ... (laughter).
... didn't see any ...
"yes. oh, what i'd like to do is find out how many - yes - what happened to the two little midcourses that's got to be with this vehicle."
yes ....
now we just take the csm and strip it down. start putting the ... stuff in here.
why are you worrying about that? why are you worried about stripping down the vehicle?
"well, you don't want - you don't want the drogue and the probe in."
"oh, yes."
"and, you do want room for the plsss. so, we'll grab this ... suit valve and ... them in there."
...
"well, the suit ... oxygen ... the cabin."
...
(clears throat) we're not planning to reenter with suits.
... a suit would help you out is for protection.
"yes, ..."
they work on the repress valve.
"yes, ..."
you know ... suit ...
breathe through the canister.
...
"yes, breathe through the canister."
my job is to maintain ...
you got all those things ...?
roger.
...
"yes, i think they forgot that."
sun must be coming back.
yes ....
"yes, i got two stars, circling back, nunki and antares ... back up again."
"actually, you can see ..."
"what? huh? 03 04 12 bo cmp that's the one you put up there, ... i would like to ..."
... to trade it in. o3 o4 12 4o mp ...
doesn't that also fit this big container back here? ob 04 12 46 cmp ...
that's a little ...
i wouldn't mind - ......
okay....
... seems to me.
guaranteed to work.
okay ....
"hey, can't you pilfer more there? yes ...."
"... what you do - what you do, you put your - 0b 04 14 36 cmp not bad ..."
"now, let's see, this burn's ... to our back, i suppose. let's hope it works."
"now, let's see. what should we be doing here now?"
okay. the next thing is power for the burn. did they give you a time to start powerup?
no ....
"yes, we ought to get a ... you know, we ought to get ... - -"
they will.
- - ...
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"go, aquarius."
"let's just recap the situation now. we're not going to do any more ptc. we'll maintain this attitude. you have already updated us on p30 load. we would like from you an los time, and a powerup start time for the pc plus 2. and an aos time."
okay. we copy that.
"we're going to also get back with you shortly, jim, for - with some burn guidelines for pc plus 2."
all right. very well.
have they powered up the mission timer - the event timer?
...
"oh, i see. are they going to? patu' i_7 0'50)i 22 13 cc apollo 13, jfouston."
"go ahead, ilouston. 0'_ oil;"",' 22 cc jim, we wore ,justdiscussing burn star monii;orint_ and we were curious to know if you can see nunki in detent 2 at this time. over. 03 04 22 h5 cdr that's affirmative. i can see nunki in detent 2,"
"okay. thank you. roughly, in what part of the field of view?"
nunki is in the upper right-hand corner.
okay. thank you.
and scorp - and antares is barely visible in the bottom of the field of view.
"okay,"
...
"hey, i bet i know how i could get an alinement. give them a cursor spiral angle. instead of maneuvering the spacecraft, i'll give them cursor spiral."
do that for ags and ...
... how's the ...?
"houston, for what it's worth, we can probably give you a cursor spiral angle on nunki and possibly antares or mo._ethan likely shaula. 03 oh 27 34 cc roger, jim. according to our calculations, nunki should be, at burn time, pretty close to the center of the aot. we've been talking that possibility over."
roger.
"also, as a matter of general interest, the sun should be in - at the bottom part of the cdr's window at the bottom of the lpd vertical line."
be at t. which is at - - lg'
that's affirm.
"it must b_' that - you're right, because it's behind us now."
"wait a minute, ?,!ding insertion attitude. 03 04 28 38 l_u_: yes, we're not at the t. attitude. lg 03 04 28 40 cml oh. 03 04 29 44 c: apollo 13, houston."
go ahead.
"jim, whenever you're through eating and ready to copy the info, i can send you the burn rules."
do you want this?
write them right on - ...?
why don't you write them right in here?
okay.
okay. i'll start on that.
"okay, vance."
go ahead.
we're all set to go.
"okay. okay. first of all, general philosophy is that these rules should be similar to loi mode i abort with the tight limits. now, i'll go through them one by one for you to copy. okay. you should shut down, if any of the following happen. thrust monitor readout, 77 percent or below; dps propellant tank pressure - that's the inlet pressure - onboard readout, 160 or below; fuel to ox delta-p, greater than 25 psi - and that would have to be a ground call to you - attitude error plus or minus 10 degrees, with the exception of the start transient; attitude-rate limits, plus or minus 10 degrees a second. and you should shut down if you get any of the following a.l_: engine gimbal, iss, plus program alarm, lgc, ces dc, and if you get an inverter light after switching inverters. are you with me? 03 04 32 52 _',_ '_i:?er. tape51/7"
okay. - -
affirmative.
"and proceeding on. if, during the burn, the engine stops, if you have a flashing noun 97, you should proceed, then ullage, engine start to push, and descent engine override on. okay. now just general information. if you didn't burn pc plus 2, probably p - p plus 4 would be the earliest mcc. ags is going to backup in a rate-fail mode only, which you know. we're talking over the star check. will have to get back with you on that. if, for some reason, there is no pc-2, you have a free-return tra- jectory with the landing at 152:02:00, and that would be after a small midcourse-5, which would probably be around 4 feet per second at 93 hours. and you have recovery forces in the indian ocean; you're in good shape there. and the indian ocean is where this landing would be. okay. you still with me?"
roger.
okay. after - -
yes. i'm with you.
"okay. after pc plus 2, there are no trim re- quirements; and, if you have a shutdown during pc plus 2, subsequent midcourse maneuvers required with - well, the earliest one would be pc plus 4. if you don't do a pc plus 2, but we still want to do one - mcc later. at pc plus 4, the increase in delt - in delta-v, or the penalty, would be about 24 feet per second, with a landing in the mid-pacific at 142:46:30. now, you should ex- pect new pads, state vectors, and targets for pc plus 2 at about get 78. over."
tell them to stand by.
"stand by, vance."
okay.
okay. how do you read_
loud and clear. p_w_e320
"okay. burn rules. we should shut down for the following: if we have the thrust monitor at 77 percent or below; number 2, if the dps pro- pellant ullage pressure is less than 160 psi; 3, if the fuel oxidizer delta-p is greater than 25, and that'll be a ground callout; 4, if the attitude error is plus or minus 10 degrees ex- cept for starting transients. okay. rate limits are plus or minus 10 degrees per second. and we're to shut down with the following alarms: an engine gimbal light, an iss with a program alarm, an lgc, a ces dc, and an inverter light, if it's still on after we've tried switching inverters. if, during the burn, the engine shuts down when the noun 97 flashes, we should pro, do manual ullage, and start pushbutton, push, and descent engine command override, open. if we don't do a pc-2, our next burn will it be at pc-4 for an added 24 foot per second. we'll land mid- pac at 142:46:30. 0kay. we'll have the jigsup for backup rate command, or rate damping, i guess. and the free return that we're on, if we don't - that we're on now, if we don't do pc-2 or 4, lands us at 152:02:00 in the indian ocean. and there's no trim requirements on this burn, and we should expect a new uplink and a new final maneuver pad from you at 178 hours."
78.
"okay. i'm sorry, 1 - yes, 78 hours. it only seems like it's been that long."
i can understand.
"okay, fred. your readback was correct."
okay.
"okay. and, vance, did you ever have any los/aos times, and - and a startup time for us to jump into this activation checklist?"
okay. let me - let me poll the house again on that one.
what?
"okay. one word is thai the - in an optimum fashion there, going tirough that 2-hour activa- tion generally took sonewhere from about an hour and 15 to an hour 20. 03 011 40 56 cc okay. i guess then we ought to alow ,yot,t a l_ttle more than that, huh? 03 04 41 06 lmi' no, i was thinking that w,,don't haw_ t.odo ab_jut four pages of it, that we probably need just about that, and that will make up for the difference of any added time we need maneuvering et cetera."
okay.
we'll need a - can i get a flashlight? you got a flashlight. we might need a spare flashlight - yes. okay. we might need a spare flashlight: have you got one? okay. okay. the sun has gone ... down.
"man, look at those stars. houston."
"go ahead, aquarius."
roger. we are in the shadow of the moon now. the sun is just about set as far as i can see and the stars are all coming out.
"okay. and if you are ready to copy, we have los/aos times for you."
flashlight. okay.
"go ahead, vance."
"okay. los 77:08:35, a0s 77:33:10. sunrise - first i'll give you sunset which is past, but that was supposed to be at 76:32:45 and sunrise 77:16:48."
"okay. los at 77:08:35, a0s at 77:33:10. sunset at 76:32:45, sunrise at 77:16:48."
"roger. we'll get back with you on the powerup time and, if you're ready to copy, have angles to load into noun 22 for your verb 49 maneuver to burn attitude. over."
okay. go ahead with the verb 49 value.
"okay. ri plus 27210, r2 plus 35570, r3 plus 33010. second item, as you know, due to maneuver with a proceed and a proceed; and, after your attitude, a reminder that p40 will not set you back to a narrow deadband. to get back to the l'age322 1.40-degree deadband, you have to use the proce- dure i gave you, which is verb 21, noun 01, enter, 3011, enter. and 200, enter."
"okay. verb 49, register 1, plus 27218; regis- ter 2, plus 35570; register 3, plus 33010; and to get the narrow deadband back we want a verb 21, noun 01, enter, 3011, enter, 200 enter."
"roger. and a correction on your - on your first number for register 1. that should be plus 27210. and another eon_nent; after you get into the narrow deadband at that attitude, why, you might tell us where you see nunki."
"roger. will do, vance."
thank you.
okay. and you corrected register 1; it's plus 27210.
roger.
and would you like us to make that maneuver at this time?
"it's down below us, isn't it?"
stand by.
can't see it.
can we have some more light in here now?
i have a light.
what do you see out your upper window?
stars.
yes. it looks like - looks like the light is coming from around those clouds.
"well, you won't get aos/los until 77."
...
yes.
...
yes.
"let's see, a0s is at 2 hours before the burn?"
just about.
"apollo 13, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, we recommend you go ahead and make your verb 49 maneuver, but just stay there in verb 49 and don't go ahead to narrow the deadband just yet. and, when you're in that attitude, why, of course, then you can make your star check. and one other item is, i don't think we got back with you, but that hour 15 for powerup sounds fine with us."
"okay. at this time, i'll start my verb 49 maneuver, but will not narrow the deadhand, and we will take a look at nunki. okay, vance."
roger.
"almost, huh?"
jim? jim?
...
"no, it shouldn't."
...
it shouldn't.
i was below that ...
...
that's a good idea.
...
... how many lights you're going to see. you can coach jim on that.
sure. we're there.
nunki?
yes. i can just barely see it. i see antares much better.
why is the wide deadhand on? stand by. is - is scorpio moving down?
what's that cloud i see over there?
i don't know. it looks like a milky way.
just a-
huh!
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay. we have completed our maneuver. we're in our wide deadband, and nunki is close to the top of my display of the aot. right now, antares seems to be more closer towards the center. however, we are in our wide deadband."
"right; understand. we'll have to make a better check later, i guess."
i can't for the life of me figure out what that dark stuff is.
"yes. did you look at it, jack? ob 04 57 46 cmp yes. okay. but i didn't recall what ..."
"see it there. like two black clouds. ob 04 58 24 cdr well, you know what this burn is buying us; l0 hours. ob 04 58 29 cmp yes. ob 04 58 32 lmp and how."
"might be a good idea. ob 04 59 41 cmp hey, that's pretty extensive, jim. you can locate it and get it halfway through the ... ob 05 o0 25 cmp strange. ob 05 o0 53 cdr it's on the aot. well, maybe not. (_05 oi 02 lmp i don't think so."
i know what that is. that might be the debris that was thrown out there.
- - into the cloud?
it's all dark now.
from the explosion.
... we made a maneuver.
"no, from our explosion."
"take a look. it covers a wide area. god, that dark cloud .... like a pair of contrails. only if you switch the detent, they go on around. how long to ids? is that right?"
"i'd sure like to try the detent 2, but i guess our damn platform's okay, isn't it?"
yes.
yes.
...
...
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. we have a little over 2 minutes until los, and everything's looking good here."
roger. yes. i take it that we don't have to start our activations until we receive aos from you.
roger. that's correct.
"you ... up our edibles? ... water? ... apollo 13-air-to-ground voice transcription 03 05 33 50 cd_ good morning, houston. iowdo you read?"
"aquarius, houston. ovar."
stand by for aos.
"houston, how do you read aquarius?"
"aquarius, houston. reading you about 3 by 3."
"houston, aquarius. ho do you read?"
"okay, fred. reading you fairly well now. how do you read?"
"okay. i read you loud and clear, ..."
roger. 03 05 38 3_ lmp jacks why don't you get the other .._
"well, go this way."
"ail right. we're going up on mare smythii, now. 03 05 40 55 cml we'll see where ... zooming off."
"oh, yes, yes, we're no longer 139 miles. we're leaving."
"yes, look at that curvature."
"that might be crisium ever there, fred."
"oh, yes; way off on the horizon, there, yes."
"hey, if you want to use the 250? there's a beautiful shot of tsiokovsky which we very seldom have."
"well, at this stage of the game beggars can't be choosers, i guess."
"yes, and we can't affozd the amps to use the heaters."
here you go.
ail right. you're in _ero phase up here.
are we - back to down voice backup?
what's that?
we down voice backup?
yes.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
roger. we still want an activation start time for a burn.
"understand. you want a powerup time, is that affirm?"
that's affirm.
okay. stand by.
okay. look it. let's get the cameras squared away; let's get all set to burn. we got one chance now.
okay.
we're not going to hack it at 152 hours.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, regarding the start time for the powerup, you mentioned an hour and 15 minutes. we think that is adequate. this is crew preference de- pending on how much time you think you need. we would go along with an hour and 15 minutes - -"
"okay - okay, sounds good."
"okay, fred-o. you been through most of that checklist for an hour? let's get it out and ..."
78 hours and ...
okay. let's ...
"hey, jack. did you ... camera back up ...?"
"okay. page 1. 03 05 48 9 cdr okay, 03 05 48 22 ij_zt' page 2, i'm going to power up the ..."
"aquarius, itouston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. we have about three items for you. we have a maneuver pad, p30 lm maneuver, again; and the maneuver pad for the cm for splashdown. we also have a checklist change with contin- gencies, - lm contingencies checklist. and, i'll stand by while you're gathering the books."
"okay. i'm at - i got the contingency book, so give me that one first."
okay. page 18 ...
okay. i'm at page 18.
"okay. about half-way down. when propellant quantity equals 30 percent, or rather 37 percent, we would like to change that line to read - when time to go is equal to 10 seconds - of course, the line under that remains the same then, descent he reg 1 to close."
"okay. when time to go equals 10 seconds, descent helium reg 1, close."
"that's affirm. before i start on the pads, another comment. the general indications that we gave you before about the sun being in the commander's window and about stars in the aot, such as that might be used as general indication for your attitude for the burn, that's all out the window. we are just going on the sun check that we made earlier and we don't feel that we have information that is good enough to give you the star and the sun in the window information."
...
"okay. you're very weak now. when you are ready to take the p30 lm maneuver pad, i'll be reading it up."
"okay. go ahead with th,_ ..."
"okay. this is p30, in maneuver pad, pc plus 2 hours, starting _ith _ioun 33, )79:27;38.30, plus 0833.0, minus 0050.9, minus 023.?, n/a, plus 0020.5, 0861.5, 4;24, 272, 081, and the rest is n/a except for comments as follows. ullage, two jets, 10 seconds; csm weight, 62480; lm weight, 33452 and the dps throttle profile is the same as before, 5 seconds at minimum, 21 seconds at 40 percent, and the remainder of the time at max. over."

"okay, aquarius; houston. you're coming in about 1 by 1 now. advise that i heard everything ex- cept the beginning noun 33 values and the com- ments. please repeat the readback on those."
"okay. i'm going to up with the power amp here, vance."
"houston, how do you resd aquarius now?"
"hey, you're loud and clear now. 03 05 59 23 _ okay. i got the power amps now, pc plus 2 hours, 079:27; 38.030, plus 08330, minus 00509, minus 02139, n/a, plus 00205, 08615, 4:24, 272, 081; rest n/a. ullage two jets, 10 seconds, csm weight 62480, lm weight 33452; dps throttle profile the same, 5 seconds idle, 40 percent at 21 seconds. remainder at max."
"roger. forty percent for 21 seconds, i believe is what you read back. and all the rest is correct. now, for the maneuver pad for the csm. over. 03 06 o0 29 _ okay. stand by."
okay. go ahead.
"okay, fred-o. this is maneuver pad monitor pc plus 2 hours; all n/a until you get to noun 61, latitude minus 21.65, minus 165.00, 1163.5, 36292, 142:39:22. over. 03 06 o1 48 cml_ monitor plane change plus 2; noun _!1minus 21.65 minus 165.00, 1163.5, 36292, 142:39:22."
"roger. that was starting with noun gl, and that's correct."
"by the way, aquarius, we see the results now from 12's seismometer. looks like your booster just hit the moon, and it's rocking it a little bit. over."
"well, at least something worked on this flight."
"and i just want to verify one thing, we could - -"
"yes, i'm sure - -"
- - go ahead.
"i say i'm sure glad we didn't have a lm impact, too."
"right. just wanted to verify - we had poor reception when i was talking to you before - i wanted to verify that you understand that the sun check you made earlier in the a0t was good, and that's what we're riding on. anything that we told you in the past about looking at the sun in the front left window or looking at stars, like nunki through the aot, why, we want to forget."
"roger. understand, vance. i think nunki would be kind of hard to see anyway with the moon right here."
right.
"and, vance, we plan to start powering up at 78:12. is that a good time or do you think we ought to hold off a little longer?"
"jim, we think that's very good."
right.
"apollo 13, houst - aquarius, houston. 03 06 08 31 limp go ahead."
"fred, after the burn, we'i get the powerdown instructions, or checklist changes to you. at the same time, we'd like to get a consumables status to you. ail i'll say right now is that we think you look in reasonably good shape."
okay. very good.
"okay. houston, aquarius."
go ahead.
okay. one caution and warning light here showing that you didn't call out - it's the pre amps - i suppose because we don't have the atca breaker in yet.
okay. that's okay.
"houston, are you planning to give us a state vector update."
"that's - that's affirm, jim. ail we need is updata link circuit breaker closed on panel 11, and po0 and accept and we can ship it up to you. p00 and data."
"okay, vance. we're in data and po0 and the circuit breaker's in. go ahead."
okay. we'll ship her up to you.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, request verify ra_ging function switch is in ranging. we need that, if it's not there now."
"you got it, vance."
thank you.
"aquarius, houston. the computer is yours."
"aquarius, houston. did you call?"
"we didn't call, houston."
okay.
"aquarius, liouston. over'."
"houston, are you calling aquarius?"
"roger, fred. i would like to confi_j! that you are getting drinking water out of, povable water out of the command module and, if you can make any estimates of how much you use as time goes on, and how much you have used, we would appre- ciate it for our consumables analysis."
okay.
"okay, jack. tried the procedure and out of that pressure, we got 10 drinks made. that's roughly 80 ounces."
"okay, fred, we had a little static on that one, but i think you said that 80 ounces of water has been used out of the cm. is that right?"
"yes. jack worked the procedure and filled as many of the drinks as he could, and he made up ten bags of approximately 8 ounces a bag."
okay. we copy that.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, just a bit of information, if for any reason you had to slip tig , our people here feel it wouldn't do much harm if you slipped it up to 30 minutes. the procedure, of course as you know, is not to pro on the flashing 99 and we thought you might like to be aware that t. time isn't all that critical, lg"
roger. understand.
"okay, vance; aquarius."
"go, fred."
"okay. i think it's finally coming through to us here, what you said just a little while ago. were you suggesting that we move the t. up 30 minutes? lg i"
"no, not at all. we're just giving you excess information. just saying if you had any problem at all it could be slipped."
"oh, okay. slipped 30 minutes. okay. that's better."
right.
"you guys are pretty fast, though."
yes. it kind of surprised us.
i guess that's what happens when you cut a lot out of a checklist.
"yes. yes, we're taking about a thousand pictures in between steps there, too. 03 06 45 33' lmp okay, houston; aquarius, radio check."
"loud and clear, fred."
"okay. i had a change in the background noises, wondered if you were still there."
"right. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription pa_e 33)4 03 07 06 25 c(_ apollo 13, houston."
"houston, aquarius. go ahead, housto:_."
"okay, aquarius. we have some ne_ information regarding what you shot2d see out the commander's window at t. . over. kg"
okay. go ahead.
"according to calculaticns- calculations, you should see the moon. it'll be a full moon. you should see most of the disk and it should be soma- where on your vertical lpd line, probably at about 14 on the lpd scale. _er. roughly centered on 14."
"okay, houston. i concvr. i'm looking at 14 on the lpd and the angle is jrst about centered. it's south of crisi_an, but its - the line is just slightly to the north cf center."
"okay, jim. that sounds very good. we see that you have a slight yaw angle, so it should be north of center."
i can even see mount marilyn from here.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, you are go for the burn. go for the burn."
roger. i understand. go for the burn.
"aquarius, 2 minutes and 40 seconds to go on the mark."
mark.
or that was - stand by.
"what was that mark? 03 07 2_ 26 cc stand by. that was incorrect. three minutes - counting down to 3 minutes, and i'll give you a mark, and i'll take int_ consideration 2 seconds."
mark. pa_e 335 0_ 07 ?4 4.1 (:_l_ l_oger. we got you.
one minute.
roger.
we're burning 40 percent.
houston copies.
one hundred percent.
roger.
"aquarius, houston. you're looking good. 03 07 2_836 cdr roger."
"aquarius, you were looking good at 2 minutes. still looking good."
two minutes. roger.
"aquarius, you're go at 3 minutes."
aquarius. roger.
"don't forget descent rfg 1, off; 10 seconds to go."
shutdown.
roger. shut down.
"are you reading our 1640, houston?"
roger. we're reading it.
we'll proceed. here's our residuals.
roger. very small.
"good burn, aquarius."
go ahead.
"i say, that was a good burn."
roger. and now we want to power down as soon as possible.
roger. understand. i
"houston, aquarius."
go ahead.
"suggest maybe you just read off the circuit breakers you want us to power down. as you did yesterday, for us."
okay. we have a procedure ready to send up to you here in about 2 minutes. let us know when you're all ready to take it.
okay.
"okay. is it going to be better to write this on a blank page_ vance, or can we use some portion of the powerdown list there in the contingency book that already exists."
stand by 1.
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"slight delay here, jim. it will be a couple of minutes before we read that up to you, and we're looking at the contingency checklist powerdown and that's on page 5. you might be getting that out while we get all r_ady to give it to you."
could you give us that page number again. page 5 doesn't make sense.
"okay. make that power 5 in the contingency checklist, fred. and it's the - -"
- - that's better.
"- - middle part of the page, it starts emergency powerdown, and we'll m_rk that up."
okay. i'm to 5 emergency powerdown.
"okay. but hold off on it because we might have to start ptc up again here. and that's the point that's being resolved right at the moment, so stand by."
"okay. 03 07 42 9 cc aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay. we're ready to give you the p_ocedure which will power you down a good bit, and after the ptc is goings maybe we can give you further information, ire you ready to copy? starting at the middle of the page, power _."
"okay. go ahead, vance."
"okay. after number 1, first line, cross out ""and vhf-a."" second line, cross out ""simplex operation."" third line, cross out ""prime."" that refers to prime power amp, off. that - that ""prime"" should actually be replaced by off. and that's the second prime that line. also in the third line the last word ""off"" should be crossed out and replaced by ""pcm."" fourth line is okay. fifth line, which is ""vhf voice, on, off, off,"" cross out. ""lighting, floods,"" which is the next line should be uti., but add the following, ""or overhead/forward prefer off."" okay. step 2 remains the same; no change for the moment. stand by. skip step 2. do not do it. just go on to step 3, which is ""configure circuit breakers per the chart."" that takes us to page power 6. why don't you give me a readback on what you had on power 5, fred-o."
"okay. on power 5, emergency powerdown. item 1, first line, i scratch the ""and vitf-a."" second line ""simplex operation."" third line, i replace the second prime which is the power amp with an ""off,"" and the last word in that line is ""off,"" replaced it with ""pcm."" fourth line is okay. fifth line, i scratch the whole line. lighting, we haven't needed floods yet so we will just leave them off, exterior lighting off. scratch line 2 and i am now on power 6, wait for your update on the cb panels."
"okay. power 6. okay. power 6 refers to panel 11. you should go per the chart with the exception of those breakers that i :all out. first line is okay. or, let's say, ?irst row. second row, quad 4, tca, closed; q;ad 3, tca, closed; quad 2, tca, closed; and quad l, tca, closed. 'fherest of that row is okay. row 3, about halfway over, j atca (pgns), closed. okay. the rest of that line is okay. fourth line, heater -rand by. okay. that line is all okay with the exception of the last three circuit breakers, fred, under pgns, which is lgc dsk_, imu standby, imu operate. those three should be closea, at least for the time being. and finally, the fifth line; it's okay as is. and would you give me a read- back on that?"
okay. i disagree on the fifth line. it appears that we ought to have the ascent eca control open.
okay. we'll check into that one and while we are listening to the rest of your readout.
"okay. and top row is correct as is. second row we want the quad tcas 1 through 4 closed. on the third row, we want the atca (pgns), closed. on the fourth row we want the pgns lgc dsky, imu standby, imu operate, sll closed, and you're saying the bottom row ss is."
okay. we'll go along with what you said on the ascent eca control. that should be open.
"okay. continue, vance."
"okay. next page, power 7, panel 16. first row, close the four quad tca circuit breakers, that is, quad 1, tca; quad 2, quad 3, and quad 4 tca. okay. rows 2, 3, and 4 are okay."
"okay. panel 16, top row, we want to close quad 1 through 4 tca breakers, and you're saying the other three rows are as is. again, i have the exception the ascent eca control on 16 should also be open."
"okay. we concur on that, and we have a late ar- rival in row 3. stand by."
"okay, fred. one addition, third row. the s-band power amp. request that you pull that circuit breaker and leave the switch in primary. t_age 339 03 07 50 !0 lmp okay. yes, that's the way we were doing it before. i'll pull the power amp cb_ and then i'll go back to the first stage and put the power amp to prime."
that's correct_ that should be changed back to prime. and that's - _hat's it.
"good work, vance."
thank you.
"reset, off and low. okay. lighting bus off; exterior lighting is off. okay. you want to get your breakers, jim? we ought to probably go back to that wide deadband."
okay. the bus tie in_erters are coming off the line.
"yes. go ahead. sorry, i put the switch off, that'll kill caution snd warning."
okay. let's see. so we're going to lose the ball again.
yes.
i'll get 16 noun 20 ut.
do you have me move auto transfer this time?
why do i still have a vhf-a receiver off?
"you don't, do you?"
yes.
"let's give them a call, panel 11."
"okay, vance. i'm on - do you read me now, hot mike?"
"roger. loud and clear, fred."
"okay. jim just noticed we got a vhy breaker in on panel 11 still, i hink, that probably should be opened."
"okay. that's affirmative. pull the vhf-a receiver. 03 07 53 54 i_p okay. pull it, jim. 03 07 53 55 cd_ i got it already. okay. now, why are we putting the cabin fan on?"
"oh, oh, oh. oh, yes. okay."
okay. i'm going to pul1 inverter 1.
"okay. not very long s:nce they had the switch off on you, anyway."
okay.
roger. - -
"- - but my only question is, i got the cross tie bus circuit breaker in._ could be - yes, this one right here."
good line. it's on. because that line is open.
i'll look over at that caution in a minute.
"vance, aquarius."
"roger. go ahead, fred."
yes. we've managed the first 30 hours or so here without the caution and warning; we don't need to keep it up now_ do we?
"okay, fred. that's one that we're leaving up until the ptc is established. we have a procedure for ptc to try with you, which we're hopeful will work pretty well. and i'll read that up as soon as you get what you're doing now done."
okay.
"why don't you go aheas, and i'll get this ptc procedure. it's by the photo log, and i'll just get that."
"and one other question, houston. you really want to pull the asa break_r? you want to give up the ags probably for good now, huh?"
"houston, i'm standing by to copy the ptc procedures"
"okay. i'll get back _ith you on your cuestion in a minute, fred. new, here comes thc ptc l_b_ j't.k procedure. step 1, gut_dance control to pgns; two mode control, att hozj); verb 76, e_er; maneuver to ptc attitude; and that _ncidentally is roll 0, pitch 90, and present yaw. we realize you can't monitor that on your fdai, but you can on a verb, with a verb 16 noun 20."
with me?
"roger. guidance control, pgns; mode control, att hold, verb 76, enter; maneuver to ptc attitude which is roll 0, pitch 90, and yaw, which is the present yaw. is that correct?"
"that's correct. okay. next. mode - at - when you're established at the attitude, mode control auto. key in verb 16 noun 20 to monitor rates; when less than 0.1 degree a second, rate in all - in each axis, then disable plus-x thrusters. okay. next verb 25, noun 07, enter; 1257, enter; 252, e...n...tomb., 1_, e..._..l.q._e_', verb 7,,7 , _....n.._. , _..m....._. h_ , enter; put in the dar 22110 and proceed; verb 34, enter; then verb 16, noun 20; and monitor rates. on rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis: verb 76, enter; mode control, att hoi,d; then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the ma_euver. over."
"okay, vance. ptc procedure: guidance control, pgns; mode control, att hold; verb 76, enter; maneuver to ptc attitude; roll 0, pitch 90, yaw 0; my ball now, of course, is inoperative, so i'll have to get that on the dsky. the 5 is mode control, auto; 6: verb 16, noun 20, monitor rates; rates less that 1 degree per secend in each axis, disable, anc i didn't hear that last part. the next one was verb 25, noun 07, enter; 1257, enter; 252, entet_; 1, enter; verb 77, enter; verb 48, enter; 22110, proceed; verb 34, enter; verb 16, noun 20, entef; monitor rates. rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in al axis. vei$ 76, enter; mode coi_i'rol, att hold; therl '_0 cljck_ o2 right yaw to stop - to start - mar_,:,_v,:r':'."

"jim, roger. your use of the tc - ttca and just a reminder that in maneuvering that - that - that roll is in r3 and yaw is in ri."
that's affirm. and i'm going to take out roll first to get it zero and then i'm going to take care of pitch.
okay.
"okay. gijtdance control, pgns; mode control to att tlold. verb 73 clears. okay. we've got to get that out .... it stopped moving."
here we go.
... the battery ....
do you know what the pus-x thrusters are?
"yes, okay. i just wanted to make sure you d,_. i got them over here."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay. a couple of thin_s, jim. one is that you can use the ttcas to maaeuver, but you're going to save a lot of fuel if you'd try mini_jm impulse. so, that might be a better recommendation. the other thing is, we'd like to give you a go before you dis- able the plus s - x thrmsters, and before you do a verb 76, and mode control to att hold. over."
"okay; understand. you _ant a go before i - i'm - of course, i just did a 76, and the mode control is in att hold, at this time. but, this is later on down."
"yes. ail we wanted to io was take a look at things before you disabled the plus-x thrusters, and be- fore you go to min impulse at the end there - that verb 76, enter; mode control, att hold."
"roger. ur,lerst_jnd. and l'r,maneuw:r'inf_my roll now ko zero."
roger.
"yes. those are the plus-x, right? 03 08 11 03 _lp houston, aquarius"
"go ahead, aquarius."
ah -
go ahead.
"in what fashion did you want us to disable those plus-x thrusters? jus_ pulling those appropriate tca breakers, or did you want to actually go in and mask those jets?"
"okay, fred. we didn't explain that. t_e verb 25, noun 07, enter sequence does that."
okay. i didn't read the whole procedure. jim just mentioned he wanted to disable plus-x.
i just did.
okay.
"and, vance, are you still trying to get me au_ answer on that - pulli_lg that asa breaker?"
"that's affirm, fred. 'this- the word h_ere is, pull it."
okay. sure didn't get much work out of the ags this time.
it's going slightly.
so is this one.
yes. you got a ways to go in pitch.
yes.
... 80.
"you want to rest a little bit? (i 0_ i(, 5;' ,f41_ wh;_t, i,im,' il_ 1._ _,j:gj'f '/_:_. j _-,',_ :r; i h_;u, what? t (,hirlk i /?,h nt/oldl, ij. ot ()ii1.8)!9 ci)i we're now in lhe hand; o1',r_jc,k.ing."
yes. it looks diffcrert than before. 03 08 19 09 _4p hard to do p37s in the tm hard to do a p37 in the lm.
"well, you can see where - -"
you almost can see - -
"- - see ptolemaeus, althonsus - there's nersdlel. 03 08 20 13 i_mp yes, you can barely see it in the corner there."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay. just some info. we're working up a proce- dure for you to use to - to use com_nand module lioh canisters to connect to your hoses - the outlet hoses in the lm so that, as time pa?_es in the mission, you car continue scrubbing t ,. lm atmosphere. and this whole thing requir _ modifying a kit so that you can attach the he c modifying a lioh canister, so you can attach 'h, hose to it. so, sometime in the future, we w_l be coming up to you wilh that procedure. second point - second point i_,,we're standing by to watch your maneuver fo_ the ptc procedure. over."
"okay. i'm in process row, vance, of maneuvering to zero yaw, 90-degree pitch, using minml_m impulse."
okay.
"and, vance, i assume it had also been brought up that we got two extra secondary cartridges - one in each plss."
roger.
we ought to start working on that mod right now.
"yes. we wish we could send you a kit and it would be kind of like jutting a model airplane i together or something. as it turn_' f,_t,this contraption will look like a mailbo_ ,_hc_you get it al put together. 03 08 22 28 i_m-__ what do we make it out of, vance?"
one canister with a - -
- - how about planning a rendezvous procedure?
- - with a plastic roo%.
"just for information, houston, during - just prior to going around the moon, we saw a lot of debris that was floating by us, including some - one rather large piece looked like the wrapping off of a line of some sort that is - still is with us."
"roger. copy, jim."
even after our free-return midcourse yesterday.
okay. we copy that.
"no matter what i do, i can't stop that. roll either way won't do it."
jim?
"well, i don't see any way around it, jim. it sure doesn't seem to be doing much, does it? it won't go down."
"i don't know. i wonder if they tried that in the simulator. i can't seem to get roll to go up. it goes down on me, no matter how i hit the controllers."
got pitch zero.
you can really see a change in rate?
"... jar here, see if it'll couple in roll."
no?
there we go.
that does it.
"i'm glad, too. l'a_e 346"
i don't know what causad it.
here we still have 67-percent fuel lovel. i wonde ' how come they didn't ... delta-v curve?
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"jim, we don't have any data on your movements right now. how does it look like this procedur's going to work out so far as getting an attitude set up, the first part of the procedure?"
"well, vance, i've been trying to use minimum impulse only attitude control to get my roll and yaw - the roll and pitch, rather. but, with the attitude control orzlyin this configuration, i - i can't command these - the roll the way i want to. so, i had to go to ttca to get my roll to build up towards zeio, it was goin_ - decreasing towards 270. i really don't know what the combina- tion is in the attitude control, that you can get the control to pitch ard roll the way you want it to. you've got to use the ttca."
roger. copy.
"i now have both pitch _md yaw - or pitch and roll going toward the designated amounts, now passing through 23 degrees in pitch, and i'm going up past 321 degrees in roll. and i am letting go that direction and when i get there, 90 in pitch and zero in roll, i'll go to auto and d_mp the rates."
get a little sleep? tlat's okay.
we've got to rig up a r:..ethoodf using those lithilm hydroxide canisters.
"okay, houston. we just got a master alarm and an ecs light. i take it the partial pressure c02 is - yes - that's what tripped it. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription tape 5_/! t_age 347"
there's that mother.
"aquarius, houston. say again."
ail right. c02. our (!02value is getting high. we had a dps ecs light and a blinking component light.
okay. copy.
stand by on that ptc 02 .
"say again, houston."
"hello, houston. how do you read? over."
"okay. read you loud and clear now, jim."
okay. did you hear what i just said about the ecs light aridthe blinking c02 component light?
okay. we got that and - stand by 1.
okay.
not much.
"jack, we might have to have you rig up this co2 rig they're talking about."
go ahead. houston. over.
0h! we 'ye got a long ways to go.
go ahead.
"okay, jim. we're going to have to get back with you in a couple of minutes on whether or not we switch over at this time to your other canister. second point, it might help in setting up this ptc if you concentrate on roll first, and get that going; and then work on pitch, when roll is established, and sort of take whatever yaw you get."
"okay. vance, i tried that but when i start doing roll only i get pitch coupled in with it. but both of them rolling u_ toward this desired amount, though. i'm u_ to 46 and in pitch and 326 in roll."
okay. understand you've tried il.
"once i get roll zeroed, i don't think it'll be too bad."
(laughter) 03 08 36 0! cdr so what did they put on my leva?
"oh, boy."
...?
"no. he didn't want it. there she goes, gang. the moon."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, vance."
"okay, jim. since the first recommendation on _nw _ maneuver _m_c =:_ ,. work out, we have another one. and you might try this. put yaw at zero, then start the roll, and the pitch after that, 03 08 37 27 lmi vance _ do you read?"
yes. i do now. go ahead.
"okay. you guys just tell me what sort of material you had in mind to build this mailbox out of, and jack and i will go to work on trying to construct that thing. assume we'll use the space-age baling wire or the gray tape?"
"that's affirm. we have a lengthy procedure here; but, in short, you use plastic as a covering for the whole thing. you put some kind of a stiffener at the top so the plastic doesn't suck against the l0i - lioh enter - entrance side. you'll - you need gray tape to stick the whole thing to- gether, and you need something like a sock to put in the - the bottom so that the outlet side is plugged up. as it turns out, the flow is rather u-shaped througt the cartridge, fred. it, if you plug up the bottom, it comes in one side of the top and goes out the other, 03 08 38 45 lamp okay. (sigh) hold on a minute. let - let us go get a cartridge and with it in hand, i'll speak to you some more. 03 08 39 0i cc aquarius, houston. over."
okay_ vance. go ahead.
"okay. really, i think we should g_ve you a mor_: detailed procedure on that; and, in general, those are the materials that are to be used, but let us get back with a detailed procedure on how to make this cartridge arrangement work."
okay.
"and to answer your question about ptc, vance, it's rather difficult to use yaw in zero right away. so what i'm doing, yaw is working toward zero_ right now. pitch is working toward 90, and roll is working toward - zero. so, we - we're just going to tsi_esome time to get there, that 's all."
roger. quite a bit of noise now. i understand you're still having a problem getting there with the ptc.
we are getting there slowly.
okay.
"aquarius, houston. let's try forward omni."
"i don't know, it looks ..."
"i don't know, it looks that way."
"okay, houston. how do you read, now?"
"houston, how do you read?"
"loud and clear, now. (_oahead."
"okay. i switched to forward omni, now."
roger ....
okay.
"they're ... off. they can't stop pitch,"
...
that would only use fvel. _ag_ 350
... and st_ck it around that way.
"must have the wrong thing, there."
"oh, yes. that was pretty."
that didn't sound very good.
"yes, hang on to that."
...
they're a hell of a long ways away.
right.
"yes, we're not moving that fast to earth. 03 08 _9 40 lmp not yet."
"hey, we're already ... this time, huh?"
yes. 03 08 50 05 i_p ... to the trajectory.
huh?
...
"yes, i've been trying to get roll out. roll to zero. just go ahead to zero, i'm going to put it in att hold. then it '11 take out yaw, leaving pitch the way it is; then we're going to pitch down."
we 'ye got to think about when we have to start changing that canister.
fifteen even.
huh?
... to 15.
what is it right now? 03 08 51 02 _ nothing. we're not resding anything.
"well, that's the one tey wanted you to leave in. 03 08 5_ lo yl? ..."
"it's in. thal's how it triggers the - okay, jack. i'm going to push in on thim thing to stop it."
yes.
"that just turned the master alarm back on. now that it's on steady, i'll leave it on. i ca_ 't understand why i got a power - oh, i know. that's right .... that reading is correct."
yaw. i'm going the wrong way though_ aren't i?
(laughter).
"okay. what we're going to do, jack, ... over there ..."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, it looks pretty good except that the pitch is going out in the wrcmg direction, now. over."
"i concur. what i'm going to do is get roll to zero and i'm trying to bring yaw into zero and as soon as i get those two pretty well matched up, then i'm going to take the pitch and try to pitch it down."
0keydoke.
okay. now i've got pitch going down; i've got roll al_most zero and yaw is almost zero.
"okay. copy, there, jif."
"houston, what's an acceptable pitch attitude, that you'll take?"
aquarius_ houston.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"roger. what's the acceptable pitch attitude that we can have for p%c? i can go into auto any time now, i'm looking at 118 degrees in pitch, practically zero roll, and about 40 de- grees of yaw. l_af'y _5'_ 0'3 09 02 3 cc ninety cb:_r'_f::', pit('.h."
i'm looking at 118 degree:; of ?itch.
stand by.
i'm trying to talk to them.
"stand by a minute, jim. the pitch is tile important thing, but - but stand by 1."
"okay. it's coming down. what's that? well, i guess i'd better eat something. hey, this one has some of that candied jelly ... you know, we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep. i said we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep."
we'll have to start thinking about getting the ... back to sleep again because - i know - i - i didn't get hardly any sleep last night at all.
"hey, fred? these jettison bags with the - are real airtight stuff, if you want to use them for wrapping for a lithium hydroxide bag or something like that."
"yes, this stuff is really tight. 03 09 07 h6 cdr yes."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. would you stable your - stabilize your rates here at the attitudes you're at now and go att hold. over."
"okay. will do. i 'm now at 103 degrees - 106 degrees pitch, and 2.5 degrees roll."
roger.
...?
no.
"... mine are ... hey, i got you a cleaa one."
okay. '?ape 54/7
"last one's in the trash bag. oh, i thought - if you wanted a ..., you'll have to use the lithium hydroxide ..."
"okay, houston. are you monitoring my angles? it appears that it might be less then 1 degree per second."
"stand by. we'll check them, jim."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, that's affirm. we're monitoring and you're almost there, but we'd like to let them stabilize a little hit longer. over."
okay. we'll - we'll just hold.
"and if - if you can now go into your eat period or do something else while the rates are stabiliz- ing, why, we recommend you relax somewhere and get some chow."
right-o. we '11 do that.
"aquarius, houston. ow_r."
go ahead.
"okay, jim. looks like your rates are damped sufficient. recommend that you go ahead with the verb 25, noun 07, enter bit on down through the verb 34, enter, and then wish you'd stand by for us to look at it again before you go beyond that. over."
"okay, houston. i'll go through verb 25, noun 07, down through verb 34 enter, and i'11 stand by."
right-o.
"okay, houston. that's complete."
"roger. houston copies, and we'll - -"
you ... monitor our rates?
roger. i'_j/?_54
we
you want to monitor the rates; we're 1620.
"roger. that's the way it should be done, and we're standing by for the rates to d_mp out some more."
okay.
how you coming?
"oh, we're taking stock of how much we got there, maybe sort of think about rationing some of it. i mean just to make sure we've got enough to last us and that we get enough water out. i'd hate to run out of water on the last day. take a look and see how much we got, and fill them up and just hold them there. yes, and i'll tell you the stuff that's good to eat now will be the candies, the sandwich spreads. maybe the freeze - the dehydrated stuff. if you have to rehydrate it, it'd be kind of difficult. no, wet packs are good."
"as a matter of fact, we might use those little - well, how about the plsss?"
"yes, i know, but i mean the plsss are bombs, too."
...
we're damping rates.
...
"well, maybe we ought to use the ops first."
you guys moving around?
okay.
"apollo 13, houston. over."
"go ahead, vance."
"jim, just a reminder. any waste water dumped at this point would reall$ jiggle up the ptc prepa- ration, so request you save that until we're spun up. over. 03 0_)2'49 cdr right. i dorl't think we'r,_ doin_ ar_y. ob 0'_a?'52 (jo no. no,  _or_'tt,hir_ :;o,but  .lu:_twanted to make sur_,you were aware of it - i thought you were."
we're saving all the water we can.
... for a minute?
with the new space .... we're ... we've just about slowed down. you're damping right.
"there she is. 03 09 32 34 lm_ and, houston, aquarius."
"houston. go ahead. 03 09 32 4b cmp okay, vance. a couple of items we uncovered for that cartridge mod. one is the special dust covering bag that we were _oing to use on the tote bags, that is pretty thick and nonporous; and we went up to the upstairs kitchen and drained water a couple of more times, and made up a whole bunch of drink bags, again; and from the pantry, we retrieved a fairly large - enelose_ - enclosure made of plastic that those drink bags are in that i think we can scissor and also make do for a cover, taping it on, if that's appropriate. 03 09 33 3h cc okay. jack lousma here has a refined version of the procedure on how to make these the easy way, and i thir_ before too long he ought to be read- ing that up to you. if - -"
"okay. 03 09 3b 53 cc it's not time critical to get this up to you. it's just that, before you get too far in assem- bling these on your own, we'd kind of like to give you the benefit of experience down here."
okay. who - who built them back there.
"tony did some of it, anl jack's been wor_ing on it, too. so we've had _ big effort on it."
"great. fag_ 356 to receivo that procedure, but we can sc_ld it up sooner, if you insist. over."
"no, that's all right, vance. before we have to worry about that i guess we got another primary and three secondaries to go through."
that's rig_nt.
"you know, sometimes those cartridges have - i guess they rejuvenate."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"man, that's a wicked low pressure down there. i wish i was on it. (laughter)."
"aquarius, houston."
... up ...
"okay, jim. your rates are once again looking good so we can continue on with the rest of this procedure. request you go ahead with the verb 76 enter, and mode controi, to att hold, and then the last step, 30 clicks yaw right."
jets are firing again.
okay. i'll do a verb 76 enter with the mode control att hold and then 30 clicks of right yaw to set the maneuver.
verb 76 enter.
roger.
"there's your verb 76, enter. mode control to att hold. now you want me to do 30 clicks of right yaw?"
"vance, did you say for me to hold on the right yaw or do you want me to start it now? 03 0g 37 04 cc no, no need to hesitat,_, you can start now."
okay.
"after you get that going, then wetii think about powering down the pgns."
okay. there were 30 clicks of right yaw.
"okay. we'd like to look at it for just a little while before we power dwn the pgns, so stand by."
understand you're planning to power down the fgns?
right. we want to get the amps down.
okay.
... finish ...
that's bad news.
take 26 pic_tures of you?
wilynot? u_ u'j_o _ l_ you want vo orlng all _ne l_l__mback empty?
i'd like to just ... and shoot it.
"well, that means i've got to -"
hey_ let me see if i can get this started here.
okay.
"hey, jim."
"yes, we'll probably get there ..."
"aquarius, houston. request aft omni."
"you got it, vance?"
roger. that did it. thank you.
"gad, there's ptolemaeus and alphonsus."
"yes, sure enough."
see them right over the edge.
"here, let me shoot a few pictures of the old moon here. r_3 av__, 43 15 cdr yes. k'cough ' which ones .. · did you put it back ?"
yes. 03 09 43 2 cdr looks like we got ... o do with earth? ptolemaeus ?
we need it to aline again.
"you don't think that burn was enough, do you?"
was that a midcourse? the rcs is worse.
the rcs ... attitude.
"... ought to come up the side. then, you got us in the right plane, ,ti_. we're in the right plane. we're pointed off and we'll swerve on again with the earth, moon, and sun. 03 09 h4 52 cdr in another respect, it might be easier to get a -"
look in the rear detent now. go to -
how's that?
awful.
"oh, that's right. that blasted service - command module is back there. scratch that one. that one?"
"it's not much better. okay, let's go this one."
keep the ...
"aqusrius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"jim, we have some status information for you, if you're ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper."
"stand by, vance."
"okay. t,_.pe 54/12 f'am_- '_59 r___',_ 09 4.f.....r_l, _,.'d"",' we'i'_,r,'&cy 'oz'you."
put that away and get some status paper here.
"go ahead, vance."
"okay. first, midcourse correction will probably be at get 104 hours, s_d all we look for is a 4- to 6-feet-per-second delta-v. okay. that's the first item. now, i will give you a r_mdown on consumables. okay. in the i_m,you lave 3408 - that is 1 4 9 8 amp_hours remaining. that means over 61 hours you'd - elqatwould average out to 24.5 amps. we expect that, after powerdown, that you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour, and that would leave a reserve of 500 amp-hours at the end of the mission. are you with me?"
"roger. we're with you. 0z 09 47 30 lmp i saved my - n_:_berwae yesterday. n3 09 47 33 _ okay. in the lm, you have"
we're with you.
"roger. in the lm, you have 215, that is 2 1 5, pounds of water, usable. that would average out over 61 hours to 3.5 pounds per hour available. okay."
"okay. and after you power down, we expect that you will be using water at the rate of 3.2 to 2.7 pounds - that's at 14 amps per hour electrical usage rate. one note, this does not - when we speak here of water available, this does not in- clude csm water and plss water, so that's added on. okay, next, lioh. using the csm cans, you will have 16 cans at 12 hours per cam to give you 1 9 2, or 192 hours, of lioh. and, in the lm, using its cans, you have 44 hours remaining."
"vance, is that with the plss secondaries?"
that's affirm. that's affirm. that includes plss secondaries.
"okay; oxygen. you have remaining 44 po_mds in the lm. at a usage rate of 0.36 pounds per hour, that leaves you 120, or 1 2 o, hours of oxygen. okay. next, rcs. rcs a stands at 6 2 percent and b at 6 2 percent. we only ex_,,u_%2 percent to be used for the ptc_ so you'r_ in good shape for rcs. next, dps delta-v. you h_w _ llq0 feet per second remaining. and, finay, csm eps. we estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. that's an estimate. and that's it. over."
okay. i copy.
"okay. and just a question. it would be inter- esting to hear from jack to see if he thinks vhat main b bus is good. if he has any idea of how, if whether it's good or not, this would influ- ence our steps in the future; for example, we might want to try to test main b to see ii'it is, in fact, good so that we'd know how to set switches for entry."
roger. just a minute. they want to know whether you thirfi_main bus b is -amygood for the eo_mnand module.
"v_, .__h__:e ...... got on the loop, let me pose the question of how we're planning on doing this midcourse, if we are going to power down the pgns."
"would you stand by on that, jim? we'd like to give you a procedure for that later on."
"okay. got a midcourse at 104 hours, lie's going to give us a procedure for that later on."
"in short, jim, we don't expect any problem, but we'll explain further later on."
okay.
"deke says get a night's sleep. he says you've been working hard, and you ought to relax a little bit and be ready for tomorrow."
"vance, this is jack."
"go ahead, jack."
"okay. let me give you my observations on main bus b. things happened pretty fast there, and we first heard the impact or explosion or what- ever caused it, i'm not sure. the next - about 1 second later, there was a master alarm which was the main bus b undervolt. i looked at the voltage, _tndthe voltage was good st h_s time so i'm susp(,cting it was a spike. 'maelcell 3 was also good, with good flow. ilowever, fred, at that point, was coming into the command module and got over into his seat. at that time, we shortly had an ac bus 2 light about the time he got into his seat. he looked at the m_in bus b and the m_in bus b was reading zero. it, however, - and the fuel cell flows were zero. i'm kind of suspecting that perhaps we do have a main - a current main bus b. but that's merely a guess. i never did try to reset it. we were having other problems with the main bus _, having an undervolt and a few other things like that. i'd kind of like to hear what your feelings are down there."
"well, jack, we copy your information. and we'd like to hold off because we're still working the problem. so we'll have to give you information later."
thank you.
"aquarius, request aft omni. 03 09 55 37 cml vance, are you back with me?"
roger. we're with you.
"okay. we lost lock there. we switched omnis. just for my own - kind of to get my thoughts in order, i'd kind of hear what - i'd like to hear what kind of entry you're planning. ems or pgns or what ?"
"okay. pgns entry is being planned, and people are at work on checklist changes and that sort of thing."
okay. real fine.
"and - we'll - we'll give you the csm stuff to- morrow, but basically we expect that main bus b is good and we're going to work up a procedure to test it."
"okay. those are my thoughts, too."
but - -
"you think main bus b i:_good, don't you? 0'309 56 39 cc that's al'firm. w(_th_r_k it is, but we want to check it out anyway. we thir)kyou gl_/:_are in grc'at sjap(, tlt the_way around. why dorl't you quit worr.ying,and go to sluep."
"oh, that - that's our boss, deke. 0_ 09 56 58 cdr well, i thi_fixwe just might do that - or part of us will."
i mixed up. how many more of those - are we hob mike? - -
yes.
"yes, i'm mixed up. you had 157 i mixed up seven more. so we got 22. by the way, there's still some water thatts- it's not enough pressure to mix up another drink, but there is some water out of there, if you want to get some water out of the drink cup."
that's good; i could use some.
we ought to use that oxygen up and not waste it. (cough)
you monitoring right now?
yes. just stand by.
what'll it take to ...
yes.
"you only got two ... there, so ..."
i will.
"you wouldn't believe it, but i'm now in command of the lm. okay. vance, i'm probably the only"
that's ever witnessed a dps burn sitting on the ascent engine head. 03 09 59 33 iivlp did you get some? is there any coming out still? they didn't answer. i think we made it. how's this working out?
"okay. no problem. pace 363 03 09 59 55 cml' they ar_.,huh? tow arl_w_ going to get an alinr_mont?"
"we'll pul one out someways, i gu_:_s. we've gotta watch that one right there."
it's decreasing now. it'll - it'll - it's cold. i noticed that _n the command module. it'll wobble.
"houston, aquarius."
switch omnis to transmit.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
roger. are you planned to set up here _ery shortly - a powerdown procedure?
"that's affirmative, if you'll take out your contingency book and turn to page power 6. over."
roger. stand by. contingency power 6. get the book over here. contingency power 6.
"well, i hope this ..."
"and while you're doing that, let's put a%'fitude control, three, switches to mode control."
ail three attitude control switches have been in mode control.
"okay. and when you get to power 6, you ought to see a circuit breaker page, panel 11."
have a pencil? let's see it - thank you.
"okay. i have power 6, panel 11."
"okay. on power 6, panel ll - the top three rows, configure them as you see them."
"okay_ now, jack ... we have put the tcas in for the previous procedure. do you want those out, now?"
"that's affirmative, ji_, pull them out. tcas open. tape '44/1_ i'tt_%' 5011 first three rows. and you're pull_'_' the atca pgns, huh?"
that's affirmative. pull atca pgns open.
okay. i've done that.
okay. are you ready for the fourth row?
affirm.
"okay. now when we get in the fourth row, we're going to open the imu operate circuit breaker; and what that means is that we're going to lose the capability to watch your cdus, so we're not going to be able to see your attitude. there- fore, we will not be able to advise you on which antenna to select for communications. the way we want you to hsmdle that is to turn the lm uplink squelch off, and when you hear the nolse, switch antennas. we'll be able to see you switch m_temlas, _u_ zt going to *_- _ _ 3 _v 5 minutes to establish a lockon again after you switch. after each time that you switch antennas, we will initiate a voice check. and basically when you see the earth out the window, you can be on forward antenna, and when the moon's _;;jn the window use the aft antenna. you copy?"
"okay. we're going to pull the imu operate cir- cuit breaker, so you won't be able to see om attitude. therefore, you won't tell us how to switch antennas and we'll enable the - i will turn the - up the squelch off so that when we start getting any static, we'll switch antennas and as a thumb rule we could use - with the earth forward, we use tile forward antenna and when we see the moon we use the aft antenna."
"that's affirmative, jim. in other words, we're leaving the antenna switching up to you, and after you switch antennas it's going to take 3 to 5 minutes for us to establish a lockon again, and we'll initiate a voice check. and i'm ready to go on panel 11, row 4. apollo 13 air-to-gi_ound voce transcription tape 55/ _fr"
okay.
"okay. on row 14,under heaters rc',;system a/b-i: open quad 1 through _; under ecs, the only change is - under glycol pump close auto transfer; under comm, the only change is: open vhf a receiver, open commander audio; under pgns, the only change is: c_ose and leave closed imu standby circuit breaker, so we can have heaters. read back."
"okay. on row 4, we're going to open all four off the heaters - the rcs system a _d b - the fir_;t four circuit breakers. we're going to close the auto transfer. we're going to open the vhf a receiver and the commander audio. and we're going to close the im_lstandby. the lgc dsky and the imu operate wj 11 be open."
"that's affirmative, j_m. all other bresd_ers in that row are as you see them in the checklist. and on row 5, the only change is _n_o wu ...... you to, under eps, open ascent eca control. over."
roger. i think we already have that opened - ascent eca control is probably already open.
"okay. so let me confirm. we'll have one comm system, that will be the lmp system, and we'll have to do our own antenna switching; thereffore, we'll have to wait about - okay, why don't you switch? aft antenna."
we'll have to wait for you to get a lockon again. is that correct?
"that's affirmative, jim. you'll be working off of the lmp's panel over there."
okay. what else do you have for me?
"okay. panel 16, that's on page power-7. top row, the only change is: under rcs system b, open pqgs/displays. over."
"okay. i may go over this with you, jack, be- cause this checklist tas been written over two or three times now on our various procedures. top row, the first two are open_ the next three are closed, and we're going to open now the quad tca's 1, 2, 3, 4; crossfeed will be closed, and the temp/press disflayflag will be opened, and wc,'r'_ 15oinks, to open uf_ th_, l'ql',_, _.1ansov wijl b, (_l(_z('d, and the ... wi ,' ,))en,,d. c)_jlo 09 26 cc that's affirmative, jim. and there's no ehan_e to the second row. over."

"that's affirmative, jffm. and in row 4, under heaters, we want them all - correction - we want all the quad heaters open. correction - we want all the quad p_eaters closed."

"we want display, open; s-band antenna, closed - to avoid a master alarm, camera - sequence camera, open; and under eps, we want displays, open; dc bus volt, closed; inverter 2, open; ascent eca, closed; a_cent eca control, open; descent eca, closed; descent eca control, closed; translunar bus tie, c_ose; we want the cross tie bus, open; the bal loads, closed; bat feed ties, closed. how do you read? ,.jj , .._ _.j)j_ okay. the four rc_ hf_a'''2,_w; ill b_. closed; dt;pi,ayr:, open; s-band ai'itenf'_a, c2_:;ed; camera ,:,equencl will be open; display wi be open; i)c bus volt will be closed; inverter 2 open; ascent eca will he closed, but the ascent eca control, open; descent eca, closed; descent eca control, closed; translunar bus tie, closed; and cross tie bus, open; and balance loads, closed; and the bat feed ties, closed. i have one question, jack. on panel - on the seco;_d line there under lighting, why are we keeping: the floods and track closed? or are they going to be open?"
"negative. we have thc,lighting breakers all closed. control the lighting with the switches and rheostats. over."
"okay. we don't need the floodlights, i don't think, but we can do it that way, i guess."
"and under row 4, under rcs systen_s a/b-2, quad heaters, you notice that we've closed those circuit breakers, but what we want you to do is to - on panel 3, turn the rcs a/b-2 quad switches 1, 2, 3, and 4, off. over."
"and we're going to watch your quad temps for you, and when we need to warm them up a little bit, we'll tell you to throw those four switches on - on panel 3."
okay. now are we sure that this ptc mode is good enough so we don't ... get crossed up later and get out of configuration.
"stand by 1 on that, jim. okay, jim, as far as we can tell right now, the ptc looks as good as any ptc we've ever seen in a csm, so we're going to go with what we've got."
okay.
"okay, and if you turn over the page on power 8, we have the spacecraft functions remaining to you. we've got low bit rate tm. however, we don't have any vhf. we have cwea. we have glycol pumps. we have suit fans. we have cabin repress for you, and stand by in attitude control here. okay, 5n attitude control, we'll have hardovers for uses in emergency, and for normal usage we want to have a 15-minute delay to get th__ heaters on to warm them up be f'ore une. how do you read? 03 0 16 06 cdr okay. i.or emergency, we have the hardovers and for normal use it requires a 15-minute request to get the heaters on. 03 0 16 16 cc that's affirmative."
"okay, jim, that concludes our powerdown pro- cedure, and we're waiting for you to get with it."
"okay, jack, we'll start. i sure hate to lose _:_e pgns. i sure hope that procedure for the mid- course is a good one."
it is.
"you want me to help yea here? 03 10 6 57 cdr yes, you can - okay. first we dower down, panel 11. ail of them open."
closed.
yes.
stand by for a master alarm .... 03 10 17 57 cm2 okay.
here it comes.
ltg. you just did it.
"i'll give you this when i'm finished. after we go through this, then you can go through it again and doublecheck it."
right.
"now, the flood lights are on, right? no, i kind of don't think we need them though, do you?"
"don't pull those. give me the - first of all. we'll get back there. 2hose four are close, open, open, engine arm, open, ..."

it will take him a minute to ...
"you're familiar with our particular spacecraft that on panel 16 heaters rcs systems a and b, quad 1 heater circuit breaker has been pushed in, and sealed in, and if it's ever pushed out, it's doubtful if we'll ever be able to reset it."
"okay, jim, on the four quad heater breakers, we want you to leave them closed. and we'll operate the heaters with the switches on panel 3. over."
okay. 0r 10 23 27 cmp no.
"okay. we'll do it right there. 03 10 24 1i cdr okay. and i'm closing the heaters on pane 4, quad 1 through 4, off."
okay. it's time for you guys to get to bed and get fred up.
"(laughter) i still have one question, jack. i still think that - i still say that the - on the lighting in our panel 16, the flood lights and the track should be open. we're not using them."
do you have any argument about -
"no problem, jim. go _head and open them, track and flood, that's all right."
"okay, track and flood are open."
"now, why don't you go through that, jack, and make sure those - - 03 0 25 10 cmp yes."
- -
"okay, i'll take this."
"okay, jack, my only other concern now is the co2 rise in the spacecraft. i guess you're keeping a handle on ttat? , / ,,, w_ that"",; aff'i_ued, jim. w,, haw' you ti* to 10.6 now, and we're willing .,og,oa litte l_igh,,_r on that. we have another cartridge ami we have a procedure for making the command module cartridges up. we'll pass that on later."
"oh, yes. i'm not worried about that. i just wanted to make sure that you - - 03 10 25 46 cml are they going to - -"
- - that - we just don't want to go to sleep here and forget about the rise in c02.
"are they going to use .,. - -"
"roger. we're watching it for you - - 03 10 25 5_ cdr yes, they're getting it ..."
- - we have it here. it's now 10.7 and we have a medical go to 5 millimeters.
t_at's a new one.
there's a new first for you.
"okay, jim, we estimate we've got 1 more hour on the primary cartridge, and 6 or 7 hours on the ': :5 '.,'?; ::'? ;'_ ' secondary."
"okay. fine. say, it's a spare primary cartridge back there, too, isn't it? so that's good for another, how long?"
"yes. yes. that's yours though, isn't it?"
"and you're right, jim. we've got another primary cartridge back there behind the ascent engine cover."
"right, yes. we know. thank you."
"yes, yes, i just - 03 10 27 51 cml okay. i guess you've done everything right on that panel. let me check the middle one. yes. you powered down and then you leave me. tell me, i've got it."

you're loud and clear.

okay.

i see you luck out with all the good shifts.
"yes, i got all the good deals. i heard jack brief you on the comm mode so, you got any questions about that? 03 1() 42 40 bm' okay. 03 10 24306 cc and how is your ptc going? i heard jack tell you that we can't see your cdu's. how's it going?"
"well, let's see, we may be offsetting slightly, the sun looks like it may be a little higher now. here comes the earth by and it looks about the same perspective. i'll have to wait to see the moon on the other side, jack .... 03 0 43 37 cc okay, fred, i can't hear you any more on account of the background noise. i assume that - i think i heard jack tell you what we're going to do about comm. uplink squelch, off. you'll take care of the antennas because we can't see your attitude. we'll give you a voice check when come up. it'l take us 3 to 5 minutes to come up. and to mako it astronaut-proof, when you see the earth, ucc a forward antenna; when you see the moon, use thc. al't one."
"yes, that's pretty straightforward. okay, i see the earth so i've very wisely shifted to forward. 03 10 4h 17 cc good boy."

"okay, when i was upstairs, just a minute ago, 1 noticed what appeared to be some new ventinxs from down the service module way. i notced that out window 1, and also saw one chunk oi' metal - loose metal about 4 inches square theft was tumbing around - silver in color, _%d it, looked like it had come from somewhere dow_ in the service module."
okay. you saw some venting out window l - -
and i -
go ahead.
"yes, that's where i happened to be looking. the lighting was such that it showed up out there. what reminded me of it was i'm looking out the lm window now and i sea a good part of the new star field it's created for us. there nrc about a thousand little sparmlies out here. 03 jo 48 30 cc okay, so you're seeing some venting out w:inaow l, and you saw a 4-inch-square piece of loose m,:.ta which was silver_ and - are you still s_ein_ the venting or has it zeroed out now? (1_ ii!4//48 lmp i don't know. i left _pstairs, i'm dow_ in the lm now, jack. i guess when jack goes ua he can take a look and let me know. okay, i'll think about switching aft here directy. i see the moon, and the moon looks pretty good, jack, so i guess our ptc still _oing pretty good. 03 0 49 09 cc okay, and we won't have any comm delay if the ptc stays good. 03 0 49 32 lmp yes, sure enough the moon is getting smaller. 03 0 49 37 cc good, and we want to ask you another question about the venting. is this - would you suppose - some new venting or is this venting that you just hadn't - that's been going on all the time, but which you hadn't looked at recently? t'lp_'55/10"
"i can't really say, jack, we'w_ been so tied up down in the lm, i guess we kind of forgot about the other half. but i've been upstairs several times and hadn't particularly noticed any flow by the windows before, so i - my first assump- tion was that it was some new venting. it real,, wasn't very heavy."
okay. copy. thank you.
and jack's going up to take a look now.
"okay. and for your informat_ion, all of our numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps. and we're using only 12.3, so we're a little fat on our analysis."
"very good. way to be. 03 0 50 52 cc and we're in a- - 03 10 50 _3 lmp i'll tell you, this aquarius has really been a winner."
"well, that's one of several. and we want to tell you something that i told jim earlier, and that concerns control. right now you have control in hardover if you need it, but when we go to some normal control modes_ since we have the quad heaters off. we want to have a 15-minute notice for attitude control request. over."
"okay, jack. offhand, i can't imagine that since we got the platform powered down why we'd need to worry about the instantaneous control. but at any rate, we need 15-minutes warmup with the heaters before we can start using thrusters. 03 0 51 54 cc right. and another thing we've done is to pull your ecs and epc display breakers and so - but we left your caution and warning powered up. so if you get ecs-type or eps caution and warning you'll have to power up those meters with the display breakers. and we are watching for you your pipa temperatures, your asa temp, your propellant temperatures except for the dps pro- pellant, and we're watching your quad temps for you."
"okay. that's very good, jack. you're watching them. that's good enough. tap_! 55/ii 03 _0 52 41 cc and everybody's fine at home e halo.

"okay. stand by 1. jack's back now. 03 10 54 _48 lmp okay. jack just came hack and he said it's still coming out; it's only coming out on the commander's side. so he saw it out the saxnewindow i did, window 1. and it's between the minus y and minus z axis."
okay. and of course - -
"jack says it's definitely the service module which was - which was my impression, too."
"okay. so you're sure it's the service module, and, of course, the thing we're interested in knowing, is it something that is residual from before, or is it somet?_ing new. and if you haw_ any ideas about that, why we', :_ure _ke to h;pj_' them."
"yes. yes, jack, !'1 o.nsw,:rhim your ,!u,:::t,m',r_ a minute, but make ,lack':: f'ir::t jrr,r',-::::i,,n ?,,-r-,:_ is that it's not n_:ar th,: r_t,:n:;it.y lno.t il, w:,.:_ right after our mishap. and 'ii h;_./,: l,, ,t,._ir,.,. with that. i'd say - he said it was a half and i said it was maybe down to a third. and houston would like to know if you have any im- pressions as to whether it is still a residual from that or maybe something new. tape 55/2"
"i don't know why after i felt that. yen, i felt it was some new something - new ventin/_, too. 03 10 57 06 hi' okay. switch to forward omni. 03 lo 57 1 cc fred-o, if you think it's practical, we're ready to give you some - we're working on some camera _ettngs for pictures of the venting. and, if you have a camera out _nd ready to go, 1_l us know which one it is so we can get the setl,fl_s for that camera. what do you think about thai? 03 l0 57 30 i.m_ okay. jack's got the one w_ th the 250-millimetc__ lens on it. that's the standard el. and i hav(_ a surface camera out that i've been shooting hundreds of earth/moon pictures with, c_nera 1. _d we also have the reseau upstairs that's _retty handy. the command module dc camera. _o you can about - - _)_ i_ 5/_o0 c( okay. i copy that - - ()_()5_/(_1 lmi_ - - take your choice, because - - 03 10 5//04 cc i copy the 250 millimei_er, the reseau is avail- able, but i didn't get what other one is;. 03 10 58 1_ lmp okay. i got my hasselblad surface camera down in the lm here handy, _oo, camera 1."
"and, jack, if we're going to do any picture t_ing out the command module windows, i think we'd better do that pretty quick, or hold up until jim and jack get their rest done."
we concur with that.
"okay, fred, we're not going to bother the skipper up there. we won't be taking any pictures out of the command module window until after rest period."
okay.
"shifting to forward 0mni. 03 i1 il 44 cc okay. fred, for your information, your c02 read- ing onboard is a little higher than what we're reading here on the ground, and so when it gets to 15 on your meter, switch to secondary. and we'd like to get a status about every 30 minutes - we'll give you a call on that. but just to let us know we're still thinking about you, we'd like you to go biomed right, please. _13jl _2 14 i,__ okay, going biomed i_liit. /ll_11 13 57 i,m' hoy, how do you read me on this cop_ mode on ;-b _d?"
"5 square, fred. how me? 03 11 28 ob cc we're still hero, fred. how'_ il going?"
okay. my co2 reading is now just below 13.
say again what it is.
it's just - just below 13.
"okay. just below 13. and just for your infor- mation, we've got people working on several subjects. we're working on the midcourse coming up to determine our control system and how to do it with the control system we select, what we should do about the alinement. we've got the lms and a co_pe of crews cranked up working on that. aridwe're also working on our entry, how and when we ought to activate the csm. and we're working on the csm systems status. to- morrow sometime we're going to have a main bus b checkout, so we've got a lot of people swinging pretty hard here and i've got some f-stop settings for you for the lvanar-surface camera. at 1/250th, we'd like you to take targets of opportunity. each picture use three f-stops, because we don't know exactly which one is going to work the best, so use 4, 5.6, and 8 and 1/250th for the surface camera. copy?"
"okay. use the surface camera at 1/250th, 4, 5.6, and 8. and i've been doing quite a bit of shoot- ing at covering two of those numbers in the range 5.6, and 8. i've also been shooting some at 11, so i'll just drop it down a little more. the moon is still so big and bright there that i got a feeling that the moon is probably up around the f/8 to f/ll range."
"roger, i didn't catch that last part. maybe when the comm gets a little better you can say it again. 03 11 30 h3 lmp okay. how do you read now, jack?"
"that's a lot better, fred. 03 il 30 48 lmp okay, i just said the moon is still so bright, that i think probably the higher rang_e of f-stops will be better; f/8, maybe even f/il. (/31 3 02 cc okay."
"i can just barely, on the left corner of the moon now, make out the foothills of fra mauro forma- tion. we never did get to see it when we were in close, there."
"okay. i'm reading on _ monitor here, fred, that you're 16214 miles away from the moon moving at about 4500 feet per second."
okay.
"from the sounds of all the work that is going on and is still going on, this flight is probably a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here. 03 li 32 41 cc yes, you've been - you've been working it out a little bit."
yes. i've really got a tough job right now switching omnis.
"well, everybody down here is 100-percent optimistic. looks like we're on the up side of the whole thing now."
"yes, i guess we had better be in good shape, particularly ourselves, rested for that entry day. i think that is going to be a pretty busy one."
"right, and we're working on procedures for that. ken's been doing quite a bit of work on getting ready for entry."
"very good. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice tra_iscrzptio_ _'_6r_ '_'tn .... jij7 03 il )17157 (;( ilow':;il,/u_it_f,f,red? 03 11 47 18 lm_ ()kay. ju:;t f'irle."
"okay. we're considering a midcourse correction at 104 hours - about 20 hours from now - 18 hours from now, and it's only 7 feet per secon_. thu other option is to keep ptc up, since we may 1lot be able to get back into it again, and delay it. so, that's the type of thini_we're thinking about, but - just wanted to let you know that you're pretty much right in the middle of lhe fairway there and our present tracking, with no midcours( _ has you - with a gamma of 7.11, as opposed to 6.51. so, you're already in the corridor. you're just a half a degree between the center and the outer limits and we're going to tweek that up."
okay. that sotmds good.
"and - we dontt - well, we think there might have been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable water. don't worry about drinking water. drink all you want. there's plenty of it. there's 38 pounds, and the surgeon recommends that you use some of the fruit juices as well. over."
"okay. yes, we went up and - and used the proee_ dure to pressurize surge tank, and jack and i made up a total of 22 drinks of - drinking water."
okay.
"and i assume that jack is up there sleeping now too, right?"
"yes. that's affirm. they're both up there. 03 _1 49 40 lmp i hate to say it, jack, but i think our ptc is about to wobble off a little bit. i've noticed that the earth is coming by somewhat lower in the window and the moon is going by somewhat higher."
"okay. understand. ptc, earth is coming by lower and moon is coming by higher."
"yes. o' lj !)1 5t_ cc and, fr_,d, rm thi::: jerry-rip, ged (?ornma,rldmodu,_ lith_un hydroxide carl::;t,(w:hra,h wt 'r(,?rjg to do is we're going to have to m_e: at least two up and use two at a time - one on each set of hoses. what we'll do is we'll connect one of these jerry-rigged boxes to the red fittings and air will be sucked through the lithium hydroxide and then blown out the blue fitting. and we're also going to, when we do this, remove the _ lithium hydroxide canister from the suit loo_, either the primary or the secondary, and we're getting the words together to make it easy to build one of these things, and it looks like it will probably take two guys, so, i think we probably ought to plan to do that later. in addition, we have to go up and get a couple of canisters out of the command module, so it looks like maybe a smart idea would be to delay a little bit and have you build a couple of these later on. what do you think? 03 11 53 17 i,mp y_. t agree_ jack. ,yackswigert and ! went upstairs earlier and both got a canister, and we were scratching around for some material and thinking about using them, and that's actually why - when we made up all the water to drink because we needed the plastic container that they were housed in in the pantry, and we had that ready to use with some material plus some of the - the extra porous bags that were going to be used for the dump control that we may just cut up and use, too."
did you come up with a design or - -
plus we got lots - -
"no. we just thought we'd see what we had in the way of material and stand by for your word. of course, we also have lots of stiff-backed card- board flight data."
"yes. we have decided to use a canister and, you know that the liquid-cooled garment has a bag around it that we think we can use, too, or that we know we can use. we've tried it. so what you have is the - a bag within a bag and inside that is the liquid-cooled garment. the bag that is closest to the liquid-cooled garment is the one we need, and we've got two of them. and then, i'age381 of course, we've got to u_c some tsp_ and, as you say, one of the backs to flight (t_tafile time line book or something like that, a_ld,just using those materials, we can make thi!_ jerry- rigged canister. so, the bag that w_'re lookil_ for is the one that is right next to the liquid- cooled garment, and, if we're very careful about where we cut it, we cs_ make a pretty good rig."
okay.
"it looks like we'll have to use that bag over again, though, because we only got two of them, and i expect that we'll have to make more than two of these canisters up."
roger.
"fred, in about 4 minutes, we're going to hand you over to a different communications s_te, and it's going to take us about a minute or so to reestab- lish uplink, so you can be prepared for that."
"okay, jack."
"fred-o, we've handed over now. how do you read?"
"loud and clear, jack."
same here.
"in fact, you're coming in a little louder."
"fred, you'll have to say again. can't read you there. there's too much background noise. maybe we need a new antenna."
okay. i'm on the other omni now. i just said that you're coming in even louder than previously.
"roger. maybe it's because i'm standing up. you're coming in better now, too."
"and, for your information, jack, i'm just going to tear into some beef and gravy and other as- sorted goodies."
i presume that you're doing this with the full permission and - of the commander.
"and this - at this moment, who do you think is the commander? t_,p,'56/4 pag_ 3_:-_"
"if i was him, i'd make you sign out everything you ate, so i'd know."
"well, i'm sneaking inside of the i2_where he doesn't have ... incidentally, this ptc must have some - must have a wobble mode around our x-axis there because now the moon and earth are back in the right perspective."
good. let's see if it goes the other way. 03 12 06 _0 cc these guys down here are saying they knew it ail the time.
"well, that's right. they do good work. whoever heard of doing a p52 in the lm?"
"say, fred, sometime when you're not too busy chewing on that beef, how about telling us what the co2 reads? 03 12 09 ob lmp okay, i'm reading 13, 1 3."
okay. it looks like our reading is getting kind of close to yours.
"yes. it appears the wobble is going the other way, jack, because the earth is now rising and the moon is starting to get lower in the window."
roger. could you give us an lpd number periodically?
"lpd number? yes, okay."
"in fact, if you could give it two or three revs in a row, why then we could predict where it's going and maybe help us set it up again if we have to."
okay.
okay. the center of the earth has just gone by at an lpd number of 4.
"roger. lpd 4, center of the earth."
and the center of the moon is about lpd 21.
"okay. lpd 21. is that the center of the moon, you say?"
that's affirm.
"and, fred, we're doing a little better on our water than we had anticipated. our numbers were designed for 3.5 pounds per houri we're using about 3.0, and expect to go a little bit less."
beautiful.
"when this flight's all over, we'll really be able to figure out what a _ can do."
maybe it'll make the ...
"if it had a heat shield, i'd say bring it home."
"okay. the earth went - just went by about - clear above the lpd index. it was - it was, if it were extended, the number would he minus 6."
okay. way up there at minus 6.
"yes, there's actually no such number. i just extended the line beyond zero which, for a nega- tive rate, is what it would be if there was one."
"right. if minus 6 was there, that's where it would be. right?"
that's right.
do you still have that super-dense star field?
"it's still there. i'm looking at it right now. i can look at - the sun is right behind me, then all these sparklies show up. yes. it kind of looks like i'm right in the middle of the - of the milky way. there are several thousand little sparklies at various ranges out as far as i can see ..."
"they're kind of interesting. they're all moving ... and sparkling there. and i can ... - at least i think i can what will occasionally give you a real star from the bunch of sparklies, but it really does break up the capability to pick out a star pattern, particularly through ..."
"okay. so far, we haven't identified what the sparklies are and what is venting."
"yes, i got a.... feeling that we p_obab2y won't get any ... until we pewer up."
"how you feeling, fred?"
"oh, as soon as i chug down this grape drink and grapefruit - orange drink, i think i'll be in pretty good shape."
"how much sleep did you get between the burn _,,_ the time you got up for this exercise?"
"oh, i'd guesstimate about h hours, jack. wait a minute, which burn you talking about?"
"it was the burn we just made. did you get any sleep between it, and the time you got up for this watch? 03 12 35 12 l_ oh, no. i didn't - i haven't been to bed since all the action the night before, and i went to go to bed for about 4 hours then ..."
yes.
"well, we're just trying to figure out who's; likely to be the most tired up there. you or jim."
i think we'll get caught up pretty good in thc next couple of days.
say again.
"we ought to get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days. 03 12 38 56 _ okay, jack. the earth has started back down. the hack on the lpd there was 1 degree."
okay. one degree on the center of the earth.
"that was a good tv show you put on the other night, fred, during lm entry."
yes. it would have been an even better one about 10 minutes later.
"yes. things sure turned to worms there in a hurry after that show. t_,.pe 56/7 i': i;' 4 '; i;' i,mi' y_::. you'r'' r:ight. 03 12 4_ 'it i_p okay. the center of thc moon new i:;!lb_ut minus 2 _egrees delta-v."
"minus 2 degrees, center of the moon."
charlie said to say hello.
who's that? 03 12 41_53 cc charlie.
"is he still around there? 03 19 h5 16 lmp unless my watch is wrong, it says it's almost 2 a.m. hack there."
no. that's the bearded one. 03 12 45 29 lm_ oh! okay.
"iley, tell charlie that i'll be back down there personally to thank him for this baby."
sure will. i did.
"okay. the earth went by there, jack, at lt'd about 18 degrees."
roger. we copy 18 degrees for the center of the earth.
okay. the moon - i'd estimate it up around minus - somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees lpd.
okay. moon's minus 17 to minus 20.
how would you like to spend a week on an air- craft carrier getting back?
"if i can get on an aircraft carrier, i don't care how long it takes, jack."
"they're going to take you by helo to samoa. you'll spend the night in samoa, get on a 141, and be at ellington shortly thereafter. 03 12 56 46 i_ okay. kind of sounds _ike the original plans for the ... 03 12 57 211 cc had you worrying that you're going to spend the night on the ship, helo to samoa ancj,!rc_'lly, to ellington."
very good.
"boy, these thrusters are sure ......"
"fred, i'm not reading you. maybe we'd bette__ wait until we change antennas or unless you ca_ speak up a little louder."
how do you read now?
better.
okay. the thrusters ... and the ... outside ... and they hardly look like they ......
"gee, i'm sorry, fred. we're just not reading you right now. maybe we'll have to wait a 2itte bit."
okay.
"let's try it now. if you can speak up, thc back- ground noise has gone down a little bit."
okay. how do you read now?
a little better.
"i was just commenting - i've been looking here at the thrusters on quads 1 and 4. we've got a slight discoloration on the outside of the barrel. the nozzles look like they hadn't ever been fired, - like they're brand new .... of like those skinny things on the interior on the upper nozzle ..."
you say the coloration of the thrusters appears they haven't been fired on quads 1 and 4?
"i'm saying all of them look clean again. i guess they've fired so clean that they don't seem to ... at all .... different color, ... copper, bronze, color of the oxygen cell. they've been fired be- cause i watched them f_re. okay. the earth's going by at an lpd of 42."
roger. copy lpd 42. is that affirm? t_l? 56/9 i'_jat_387 03 13 01 03 _4i' that's affirm.
"and, fred, that may be why the com4is a little bit degraded, more background noise, because we're getting out of attitude a little bit there. 03 13 01 28 lm_ roger."
how do you read on aft obfninow ...?
"i'm reading you, fred. i've got a lot oi'ba_i- ground noise. looks like it might come and go with attitude. 03 13 03 5h lmp yes. i think that's probably - just looking through the command module at you now."
"how do you read now, jack?"
"about the s_ne, fred. 03 13 oh 52 l_mp okay."
okay. and the moon just went by at about minus 14 degrees.
"okay, the moon at minus 4. 03 d3 05 2h lmp that - that's correct."
"okay. your landing in - your weather in the landing area, which is about 560 miles south of samoa, is now predicted to be about 1500, scattered, high broken. waves are going to be 5 feet, the winds are going to be 15 knots, visibility 20 miles, showers in less than 10 per- cent of the area, and you will be landing al 08:00 local, roughly."
"hey, that all sounds pretty good."
"say, fred, did you get the dope on the saturn _v impact - s-ivb impact?"
"yes. just as we came around the corner, vance, they told us that it hit - i don't recall the position now, but it was a ... impact ... and recorded it on the ... seismometer."
"yes. it impacted 74 nautical miles from the alsep and the passive seismic detected major seismic activity on all long p=_riod channels and this 'rape56/10 wa,:; - lh:; n_'l, ivil,y win', d,.l,._'l,,,d l'_ !' )1 h_,l_s n.i'i,(,r'w_lr'd;: wi iaib'*'_'_'_j:;jli a, lf,l  1,1,_,j,. /':l_d l,j,_- rrllnct, _,l:;(_wn:; det_'ct,,'d by lhc lit'il-' ,_r._-'_y chaunels ...

yes. that ought to add ... _oll0 13 air-to-ground voice transcription 03 3 1 42 _p okay. r_e earth lpd number that time was $2.
roger. thirty-two.
"how do you read now, jack?"
"i'm reading you, fred. i've got a lot of background noise, though."
"jack, i can definitely tell we're moving away from the moon, now. i got it all in the monocular at one time. we're right over the top of fpa 8 right now."
you're right over the top of what?
on a point between it and censorinus - fpa 8 and - the point halfway between there and censorinus.
"fred-o, would say the checkpoint over which you're right now? 03 13 15 56 _mp okay. and incidentally, the delta-v on the moon was zero, so it's coming back down. the point looks like we're just about straight over is around censorinus and the point between it and fpa 8."
okay.
"okay. and, jack, the earth lpd angle is 24 degrees."
"roger. earth at 24. and it looks like you're getting up to about 15 on the c02, so we want you to select secondary and swap out the primary cartridge. over."
okay. i'll select sec0_ary and swap out the primary cartridge.
"okay, fred. and when you select - when you swap out the primary cartridge, don't reselect primary. stay on sec0n_ary until we use the secondary up. over."
"okay. i'm changing out primary and - stay in secondary until we use _t up. 'l':l_',,t/t'"
"and the change out is c_nplete, jack."
"okay. copy the changeout complete, and we're reading 4.5 on the c02 here."
okay. i'm ...
okay. and the earth lpd was 8 degrees.
"did you - did you say 8 degrees, fred? 03 13 32 31 _ affirmative."
okay.
"well, i missed the moon on that one, jack. but i would guess - estimating back a little bit, the lpd angle was somewhere around 42."
"fred, i'm having a hard time reading you, but i think you're giving me a lpd anglo."
roger. that's its jack. the moon is about 42.
you say the moon is at 22?
"four two, 42."
"okay, 4 2. thank you."
"how you doing there, fred?"
...
"okay, fred. i can just barely hear you saying something in the background and i can't make out what it is."
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"hello there, aquarius. oo ahead."
roger. and fred is being relieved now. he's - went back to get some rest. this is lovell here who's got the duty.
"gee whiz. you got up kind of early, didn't you?"
"it's cold back there in _he command module. j t_,pe c,7 /o pn_e 391 03 13 51 $8 cc well, what we were really thlnking about doin6 was letting you sleep a little bit 2onger because we figure you're pretty worn out."
"well, i'll go back and forth once in a while to get a ..."
is jack up there with you?
"no, jack's still sacked out."
"okay, jim. we're kind of watching this ptc a little bit. fred's been giving us a few lpd angles as we swang by the center of the earth - center of the moon. we noticed that the comm has been degrading just a little bit so you might have to talk up."
roger. understand.
"and we just went on to the secondary c02 canister. fred swapped out the primary, but we want to stay on the secondary until it is all used up."
okay. i'm going to use the tape ... c02.
we're reading a partial pressure c02 of 4.2 milli- meters. we're cleared to use the secondary until it reaches 15.
okay. that's good.
"aquarius, in comparing ot_ initial estimates of water usage and electrical power usage, it appears that we're right on the money on water usage, and we're using a little less amperes than we had originally expected in our first analysis, so we're either right on the money or just a little bit ahead of the game in that regard."
"well, that sounds encouraging, jack."
"and there are a few temperatures that we're watching for you. you have the heaters powered down. we're looking at them, and those include the pipas, the asa, the q_ad temps, and your propellants, except for the dps propellant. ts.ye 57/4"
okay. i've got them here.
"we have, as you probably know, several groups working on procedures from here on out. we have a group working on m_deourse corrections to determine a system, the attitudes, how to do it, alinement techniques, and so forth. we have a group working on the entry, including how and when we're going to activate the csm. we have a group working on the csm system status, and in a few hours - later on tomorrow, from where we see it, we're going to go to some base configuration on the csm and we're going to conduct a main bus b check. right now the comm is kind of degrading, and i can't hear what you're about to say very well. but i just want to keep you advised as to how things are going here. and remember you've got duty on the antennas."
aquarius_ are you reading houston?
...
"okay, jim. i can hear you talking but i can't tell what you're saying because you're way down in the background noise."
okay. can you hear aquarius now? over.
"oh, yes. that's much better. did you get my report on the various types of people and what they're doing around here?"
"roger. sounds like you had things well organized. you might also consider what kind of a stowage configuration ... and what we can leave behind in aquarius,"
"okay, jim. i didn't catch that suggestion on account of the background noise; maybe we can pass it on when it gets more favorable. 03 l_l06 07 cdr i'm thinking in terms of stowage. whether we would leave the suit .... the hyeon camera in aquarius, prior to ..."
okay. i heard you say something about using the hycon camera in aquarius. tane 7/_
"negative, jack. i'm thinking of reentry !_towage attitude. whether we should - what we _hould leave behind in aquarius. leave the suits behind; leaving such big items as the hycon c_neras in aquarius. over."
"oh, understand. you're thinking about stowage. what'll we leave behind in aquarius when we fall back into odyssey. is that right?"
that's affirmative.
"okay. we've people working on that, too."
"and we presently are tracking you at 22 500 m_les from the moon, moving out at 4400 feet a second."
aquarius. roger.
"and, jim, earlier in the evening, we thought there was a misunderstanding about the amount of pot__ water you can drink, but we want to advise you that you can drink as much water as you want to. there's 38 pounds in the potable tank, and that's about all you'll need. the doctors suggest you drink as much fruit juices as you want, too."
"roger, jack."
"jim, earlier in the evening, fred-o reported some venting out of window number 1 in the command module. he also reported a piece of loose metal about 4 inches square, silver, floating by, and one thing we were trying to establish is whether or not this is a new venting or whether this is part of the residual venting of our original problem. do you have any more words or co_nents? and one thing he was doing was taking some photographs and we authorized photographs, targets of opportunity, using the lunar-surface camera number 1, and use the setting of 1/250 of a second, and not knowing precisely what f-stop to use, we suggested taking three of each, using settings of f:4, f:5.6, and f:8. over."
"roger, jack. the ventirg really seems to ... i reported earlier, i alsc spotted the large piece go by and prior to our ... burn ... the venting you see now is much greater ... went into the dark mode, you could easily distinguish stars paae 394 and _idn't haw · tho brifg_t _r'ticrm _lr_d _r_ght pj/o toar'apll:: .... 03 ih 16 09 cc okay, jim. once again i hear you taking hack there but i can only pick out a few words; maybe we'll have a better time."
"aquarius, we're trying to improve our communica- tions. could you turn the biomed off and give us a voice check, please?"
"voice check follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; voice check out. ob 14 17 18 cc okay, jim. that seemed to be better."
"how are you doing there, aquarius? 03 4 31 08 cdr we're doing good, jack."
"okay. sometime when you get two guys available there and you could construct one of these lithium hydroxide rigs, i'd like to have you get the materials together, and we'll go through the steps together."
"okay. sounds good. and how do you read me now? 03 ih 31 33 cc well, there is a lot of background noise, and sometimes it is worse than others and right now i hear you better than i have in the past."
"okay, jack. i'm kind of curious the amount of perturbations our ptc attitude is taking. y notice that we are getting off attitude, and i'm just kind of curious how far we can let this go."
"we were tracking the attitudes with fred earlier and it looked like what we were doing was oscil- lating about some point, but coming back. are you detecting some kind 2f divergence now?"
"not too much. i notice that it's different than when i went to sleep. we are more at an angle now with the terminator of the earth, so when we started out, we were just about parallel with the terminator, and now _e are canted off somewhat. i haven't seen any trends, though, of going back and forth. tape 57/'( ob 4 33 08 cc and, jim, our current plan is to not correct _he ptc. we're going to take whatever we get and live with it. and we can kind of keep track of what's going on a little better if when you swing past the earth and swing past the center of the moon, if you could read off the lpd angles for the center of the earth and the center of the moon. over."
"roger. will do, jack. and i'm looking into the aot now to the right - no, the number 4 detent, and we are venting something back there; i can see particles moving on past the command module. what it is, i don't knew."
okay. can you identify the quadrant?
"well, i'm looking through the right rear reticle now of the aot, and when i was back _n the command m_e,_""_ i could see it out of the cm i window. the particles are rather small, but they are coming out with some force. that's probably what is disturbing our ptc attitude. 03 lh 34 50 cc yes, that sounds quite probable, jim. that's about the same report we got from fred, tut we haven't been able to identify what they might be and probably won't be able to until we crank up the csm. if there's any change in that status, why, we just want to keep advised of it."
roger. understand.
"and, aquarius, we are setting a pretty good vector on you now. and it looks like you're a little bit outside of the corrldor. we're looking at a 7-foot-per-second midcourse at 104 hours. we are going to come up with an entry interface minus 8 pad to use in the event of a loss of comm situatior"
"roger. understand, and i hope you have that pro- cedure for attitude."
"we are ginning up a procedure for attitude for you, jim. for the no-comm case, it may be a little different than wi,at the guys working on the procedures come up _ith for the burn at 104 hours."
roger. 'papc 57/8 yagc_ 2496
"what i'm saying, jim, is the guys who are working on this attitude situation for the burns haven't made their final conclusions yet, but in the interim period, we want to come up with something you can use, in the event that you lose comm."
i concur.
"houston, aquarius. the earth is going through the 10-degree line or angle of the lpd."
"okay, we copied 10 degrees. is that earth or moon, jim?"
that is earth.
"okay. earth 10 degrees. thank you. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription 03 1_ 45 53 cdr and, houston ... as we ... no_ ... has mn sm_fe of about 24 degrees or:the lpd."
"okay. we read 24, jim."
"that's affirm,"
"jack, ... the lpd on the moon now is 22 degrees."
"okay. i'm reading you better, jim. say again, please."
roger. the lpd now on the moon is 22 degrees. i missed the earth la.':ttime. i'll get it this time.
"okay. twenty-two degrees, and looks like we've come up with a procedure for the attitude control on the upcoming burns. probably the ones that we'll use from here on out."
"okay, jack. stand by 1."
it's going to be a few minutes before i'm ready to read it up to you.
okay.
"jack, on the first of the lpd angles is about a minus 2 degrees and just slightly above the top line."
okay. just went by minus 2 degrees. is that on the earth?
"that's the earth. now, i don't know whether we're oscillating back and forth or not, jack, or whether it's a continual motion. we'll have to see here."
roger.
"okay, jack. the moon now has an lpd angle of 10 degrees"
roger. the moon at 10 degrees. tat_e 58/i!
"okay, jim. just as kind of a lead-in to this procedure that we're _oing to use for the mid- course burn, i'd like to say that we're going to use ags and it's going to be a manual burn. the attitude will be c_ontrolled manually_ the start/stop on the engine will be controlled man- ually. so we have a pretty good vector on you now, and it turns out you're coming in a little bit too shallow. so _at that means is we're going to make our burn to come in a little more steeply, and we're going to be coming in around the dark side of the earth. therefore, to come in more steep, our thrust should be in the di- rection of the sun. does that all make sense to you?"
"i think so. we're going to use ags for a burn monitor. the burns _'e going to be manual, _md they're going to be started manually and stopped manually."
"okay. and your reentry is around the dark side of the earth, and since we're coming in shallow, we're going to have to burn toward the sun to make it steeper. do you follow that?"
that's affirm. especially these burns will be perpendicular to our flight path and to the sun giving a steeper entry angle.
"okay, jim. i heard you say perpendicular to your flight path, which is affirmative, and i didn't get the rest of your statement."
"i understand the technique, jack. we're burning to give us time to steepen our entry angle, and it will be perpendicular to our flight path for corridor control."
"okay. that's affirmative. so, in general terms, what we're going to have to do is to power up the ags and bring up the ags eight-ball, and then to set up your a_titude, put the coas in the front window, and guidance control will be in ags, of course. but manually orient the spacecraft to place the center of the earth directly out the z-axis. then rotate about the z-axis to place the point of the crescent on the y-axis of the coas. l_d this will have your plus x-axis in the direction of the surl as we discussed before. so the crescent will be up with the point down. copy that?"
"okay, jack. we'll have to _o over _hat again. the coas will be out front wir_dow; we'll place the earth in the center of the coas, and, let's see, the center of the earth right now is paral- lel to the lpd which is about parallel to our x-axis. and we'll have to rotate about 90 de- grees to get our x-axis pointing toward the sun."
"okay, jim. so we want to get the y-axis of the spacecraft parallel to the terminator by putting the points of the crescent on the y-axis. ob 15 09 35 cdr roger. understand."
"seriously, jack, when i stop the spacecraft looking at - at the earth, i'm going to have to roll - in lm terms, roll the spacecraft 90 de- grees to get the tip of the earth all on the y-axis."
"that's affirmative, jim. you're going to have to roll 90 degrees to point your plus x-axis at the sun and put the crescent - the points of the crescent on the y-axis. the points of the crescent on the y-axis with the coas pointed at the center of the earth will take care of your yaw and your pitch."
roger.
"okay, jim. after you get that orientation to come in a little more steeply, we perform an ags body-axis aline which is at 400 plus 5 on the deda. if the ags ball is up at this time, the ags ball will go to 000. we can talk more about control modes later, but we'd recommend doing this, of course, in ags attitude hold - attitude hold. put your yaw to mode control and leave pitch and roll in pulse_ therefore, con- trolling your attitude with the ttca. we don't want to use the gimbal, so have engine gimbal off. we'll make these burns at 10-percent thrust. we'll use a _aanual start and stop. for ullage, we'll use the plus-x translational button, and ullage will be for 10 seconds. over."
"okay. i understand what you're saying, but you'll have to repeat it here. pa_? 400 o 25 13 j5 cc okay. we'll pcrl'orm l,hh lufri i.: (iul)m_ci! coi- trol to ags. and moi)t': contiol to att'?ude hold. your attitude control switches will be roll to pulse, pitch to pulse, and yaw to mode control. so the ags will control your yaw and you will use the ttca to control pitch and roll. engine gimbal off; 10-percent thrust. start and stop manual. for ullage, use the plus-x translational button; 10 seconds ullage. over."
"okay. for the burn there will be go to guidance control ags, mode control att hold, attitude control switches will be roll pulse, pitch pulse, yaw mode control. we'll use ttca control for pitch and roll. engii_e gimbal will be off; we'll be using 10-percent thrust; we'll start and stop manually, the ... control ullage will be a plus-x translational button. and also our thrust will still be, but before that we are going to do an ags aline ... ball ..."
"that's affirmative, jim. after you get oriented in the attitude you want to burn in, do an ags aline which is - an ags body-axis aline which is 400 plus 5. when you get enter, this will bring ball up to 000, and i want to confirm that you - that you said engine gimbal off. 0-f-f. over."
roger. confirm that engine gimbal will be off.
"and, jack, how long do you estimate the length of the burns will be?"
okay. the length of the burns are going to be probably less than a minute. and we want you to have cut-off based on time. so we will give you a burn time. and i have a p30 maneuver pad for midcourse-7 in the event that we lose comm if you are ready to copy.
"okay, jack. ready to copy."
"okay, jim. p30 lm maneuver pad: the purpose is midcourse-7. noun 33 is 134:59:42.98. noun 81 is n/a. ha is n/a. !b is plus 0020.5. delta-v r is 0019.3. burn time, 0:39; 008, 000; the rest is n/a; thrust will b_ at 10 percent. read back."
"ail right. this is midcourse-7 corridor control, and it's in case we lose comm: 134:59:42.98; noun 81 is n/a; 42, n/a; plus 0020.5; 0019.3. burn time, 0:39; 008, 000. ail the rest is n/a: thrust 10 percent."
"okay, jim. that's a good readbaek, and in the event of lost comm, use the procedures that i gave you. it may be that between now and tomor- row these procedures will change a little bit, so we'll go with what we've got now, and stand by for something better if it comes. over. f 03 15 19 28 cdr okay, jack. i'm looking at your burn pad and i see that the ... total gimbal ... 19.3 feet per second."
"okay, jim. we verify 19.3 feet per second for 39 seconds."
the old midcourse technique sounds like some- thing that we came up with on apollo 8.
"yes, everybody wondered if you would remember that; by golly, you did."
"hey, jim, i got a little bit more information - maneuver pad, i got lat/long range to go, verb 10 and get; if you got a place to copy that down, i'll give it to you for ems."
okay. stand by.
go ahead. tape 5?/1 ?age _02
"okay, jim. i just have the asr three blocks. noun 61: latitude, minus 021.62; ongitude, minus 265.37; range to go, 2162.9; verf 10:362_1: get of .05g is 142:h1:30; read back."
"i didn't get the latitude, but the longitude is minus 165.67; range te go, 629; veocity 36291; 142:41'30."
"okay, jim. the latitude is minus 021.62; i i_ave a correction on the longitude - minus 165.37. go ahead."
"roger, jack. the latitude is minus 21.62; longitude is minus 16_.37, and this goes in conjunction with that midcourse 7 pad you gave us."
"that's affirmative. that means no maneuvers between now and midcourse 7- and this is a horizontal in-plane burn, plus x, toward the sun, 19.3 feet per second."

"and, jim, on the - setting up the ags, right after you do the 400 plus 5, you should do a 400 plus all balls. and one other point we want to clarify is that we know that youtre sure that this burn will be made with the plus x-axis pointing at the sun to make the entry angle steeper. you got it?"
"that's right, jack. what i'm going to do is - we'll stop with the earth in the commander's window, the coas down, and then i'm going to maneuver the spacecraft so that i have the lighted portion of the earth at the top of the window; that is, the coas will be along the plus-y of the spacecraft and the top of the window - of the rendezvous window, i should be looking into the sun. that means i'll be burn- ing towards the sun and steepening the angle."
"that's affirm, jim. i - you got the attitude right, and did you copy about doing a 400 plus all balls after - you do the 400 plus 5? that is, a 400 plus 5 and a 400 plus all zeros back to back. tape 59/;'"
roger. i have copied that.
"jack - this is aquarius. i'm not to_ sure h_,': long or with what force the venting is going to do to our trajectory. however, you might kee_ a check on that. it may have been going on fsr some time."
"roger, jim. we've been taking a look at it. we haven't been able to detect it on the doppler, however."
roger.
but we think it's pretty small.
"and, houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"jack, would you give me a time hack on an even get so i can start my watch."
"okay. coming up on 87 hours and 35 minutes, we will be there in 30 seconds. set it for 87.35."
just give me a hack at 88 hours.
okay. i'll give you a hack at 88 hours. that'll ! be another 25 minutes.
"ail right. thanks. au_i,lo .l3 aii_-to-(i_()ulii_ voice taii_;ctiption y'a_'_e)iu4"
"louston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay, jack. let's just talk over how i'm _-.oin_: to get to the attitude aad then do the burn. what i'm talking about is the control techni4ues. the way it looks now i'll try to stop the ,_i'_ce- craft in yaw with the earth out my window, i:_en we'll be in guidance or we'll be ags control; we'll be in - yaw will be in mode control. then we'll be using the ttcas to control the pitch : d then control the roll. i don't see another way we can control the combination that we have here without using the ttcas. then we will also use the ttca during engine burn. do you people con- cur with that technique? 03 5 43 05 cc jim, that sounds like the one that is best to use to me. let me talk jt over with the rest of the guys here, and we'll advise you."
okay.
"jim, in that control mode, that sounds lij_ethe best way to go. the only thing you'll have to do is to get attitude hold in the ags, and so before you start to maneuver, you'll have t_ bring the ags up, and get a 400 plus all zeron in there, and then ags will respond in yaw when you go to mode control. that is, ags will con- trol your yaw in mode control and your pitch and roll can be taken care of in pulse with a ttca. after you get in attitude, then, you'll have to re-do an ags body axis aline which is 400 plus 5, then go back to 400 plus all zeros again."
"right, jack. that was my next question. i don't want to aline the ags ball 000 until i am in po- sition, so we use that as a primary attitude burn monitor device."
"and, jim, you can do a 400 plus all zeros any time you want to; that just tells the ags that you want it to control your attitude should you go to attitude hold in mode control. 03 5 48 19 cdr roger. i understand, but after we t?t to the attitude, we'12 do a 400 plus 5 to met the agf? aline ball, and then we'll do a h00 plus zero."
affirmative.
"another thing, jim, is while you're maneuvering to that attitude using _ to control --_.......-. if you find out enroute to that attitude tltv you didn't quite have the yaw where you wanzed it to be, you can use your aca and tweak up !he yaw, and your ags needles go right back to zero because you zero the attitude errors."
roger. sounds good.
"jim, you'll be splashing down about 560 miles southeast of samoa at about 0800 local time. the weather forecast for the area is good_ 500, scattered, high broken, 10-mile visibility. the seas will be 5-foot waves, 15 knots, and you'll _- going to _._o_ by boat ._.n._./.n.r..a._.r._.r_ft_ you'll spend either the night on the boat or in a and return to ellington by 141 on saturday, the following day."
roger. would you tell the people of the lrl to turn it off.
"oh, no. we're going to do the whole bit."
"and don't forget my hack at 88 hours, jack."
"say again, please, aquarius."
i want to get my time hack at 88 hours.
roger. that will be in about 6-1/2 more minutes.
roger.
"jim, we got a couple of news-type items. presi- dent nixon has chosen a judge from minnesota for the position of assocffate justice in the supreme court. a bill gi_ing federal employees a 6-percent pay raise passed the house and went to the president; includes the military. and the air traffic controllers returned to work. pa_e 406 03 15 56 57 ci)r well, thal,'n /ir'eat. you think th, y'lj consider t,lli:; f_l_ f'lig, ht pa y7 )_ 5 57 _3 cc we 1, wcrr, i/4ht br ;i/bl_: to work oul. ::_m._... f'car_-, merit."
standing by for the 88-hour time hack.
"say again, jim."
standing by for the 88-hour time hack.
okay. we got a minute to go.
"okay. coming up on the 88-hour mark. i'1 _iw, you a 2-second delay. stand by to mark."
mark.
i got it.
"how are you doing, jim?"
"pretty good, jack. say, you might have the peo- ple look at our dps burn card to see what changes have to be made on it for the burn."
"heard you say look at the dps burn; you'll haye to say what about it again, please."
"roger, jack. you might take a look at our dp_ burn card, our checklist card that we have in the lm, and see what changes might have to be put in that checklist."
"okay, dps burn card."
"how're you doing there, jim?"
"okay, jack. it appears that we're going - funny diversion here, the ptc attitude in - in pitch. i'm going to do a lpd check now, but the last time the moon went around, it was above - way away above the lpd angle and i see the earth coming around now which is going to be pretty low. they oscillate back and forth, but each time they seem to get a little farther away from the center line. you might think of some pro- cedure to reestablish ptc, if itts necessary."
okay.
"jim, the only way we know of y_et,tint:_the as _ood or a better ptc than you've got r_t_ht n,,w is _,_ crank up the g & n and we - we don't want to d_- that. so our plan is to just take whatever _,--, get out of this, and later on, it may turn out by the time you get to burn attitude, you'll _ce right where you want to be."
okay. we'll just leave her go.
"houston, aquarius."
go ahead.
what's our course of action to set up ptc after this midcourse at 1077
we thought you'd ask that.
"the only thing we can try to do, jim, is t,o_et the thing up manually and see what happens. thcre must be a better answer than that"
okay.
"- - and one course of action is to omit the mid- course and make a total midcourse, say, about 8 hours before entry. we haven't decided yet."
"right now we're talking about a 7-foot-per-second midcourse at 104 hours. and extrapolate that down to about 8 hours before entry. we gave you a pad for that - that's about, only 19 feet per second, so if it doesn't change too much - and we can get all kinds of dps."
understand. sure like to keep this vehicle in the corridor though.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
can you think of any normal venting phenomena that might occur like maybe _ a hydrogen tank that's over-pressurized relieving in the window?
"yes, we thought of that, jim. fage 408 (;_ 16 5_ u_ (-i; that i:_on_ po:;._;ibiiit.y i,jjal w_""v,, i,hou_ht of, d ira, t)a'cau_' - wc h,_at_'d ilf, 1.hat t:_hk, _j.rld wf: haven't been usin_ any hydrof,en and, therefore. it could be venting in the overboard release."
"right. the only other thing i can vhink of when i look at it through the aot is - it did appear to be coming from one spot, but that's the only difference although i can't see where it is com- ing from because it's beyond the curvature of the command module. but, it appears like it. _ ir-bt be coming from more than this one spot."
"okay. thank you. we hope that when we cr_lk _,_ the command module tomorrow that we'll be able to - or later on today - that we will be able to identify more closely what it's been coming from. but, the guidance guys say that they haven't been able to see the results of any venting in their data and it would take a very, very small r_nount to perturb their data."
"well, thatts a note of encouragement."
(music)
you got a chinese band going up there?
"oh, sorry. i forgot all about hot mike."
sounds pretty good.
"jim, we've had you scheduled for an eat period about an hour ago. i suppose you've taken care of that. the other thing is we're kind of in- terested in knowing how long you're going to be at stick there, or if you're going to go back to bed or what?"
"okay, jack. we're - we're going to set up a regular watch and sleep period here. fred was up for a long time, so i got up a little bit early to relieve him. jack and fred are now asleep, so i'm going to let them sleep as long as they can, and then we'll have an eat period and then i'll go back to bed for a bit. and we'll separate the schedule."
"okay. we're right at the point now where, according to the flight plan that we had made up for you, that you would have all l_inished eating and you and jack would have the duty while fred went to sleep. so, ess_mtially, according to the plan we've got, you got ud ab_.... 3 or 4 hours early. and - the next time that ._ have that as a rest period for you is at 96 hours, which is 7 hours from now, and an hour before that, say at 95 hours, all three of you would eat, and then you and jack would hit the sack again and fred would have the duty until 102 hours. we'd be glad to take care of this work-rest cyel for you."
"okay. that's good. let me - let me wait until they get up, or at least jack gets up. he should be getting up before fred. and we'll try to get back on the schedule. i hate to wa_e everybody up right now though, if they're sleeping."
"okay. your choice on that. as soon as jack gets up, i'd suggest we go ahead and break up these lithium hydroxide canisters and make a couple of them. jack could work on that. it's going to take four sets of hands, i think."
"okay. we'll make that the project, getting the lithium hydroxide canister squared away. a ll0 13 air-to-groh_d voice traa ,ription ''apo61/1. 'age il0 ()'17 58 2'_ cc aquarius, ttouston. over."

okay. do you have any equipment listed? i' just get it and give it to him and i can just sit here where i am.
"okay. i think the equipment you'll need will be two command module lith_llm hydroxide canisters, a roll of the gray tape, the two lcgs, because we're going to use the bags from the lcgs, and one - one lm cue card - one of those cardboard cue cards which you will cut off about an inch and a half out from the ring. now, i think that's all we'll need. over."
"okay .... okay, houston."
"hello, houston."
"go ahead, jim."
"okay. that's two lithium hydroxide canisters, one roll of that special gray tape, two lcgs which we're going to use the bags from, one lm cue card and ..."
"okay. that's affirmative, jim. if you'll just cut the cue card, which is a handy piece of stiff paper the right size, about an inch and a half from the rings. just cut off the ring holes, in other words, and you'll have a card about 11 inches long and probably 6 inches wide, something like that."
"okay, ... i'll have jack gather up the stuff."
okay.

"okay, houston; aquarius."
"yes. aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"we have gathered the materials, and i can put jack on the headset and he can copy the instruc- tions ... do you see any need for - or should i copy it to give them to him, or do you th_nk they're too detailed?"
"why don't you pul him on the headsets, jim, and i'll read it out to him."
okay.
"okay, joe ...."
"okay, jack. did anybody ever tell you that you got a 60-day extension on your income tax. over."
"yes. i think - i think somebody said that when you are out of your country, you get a 60-day extension."
"okay; right. okay. i'm ready to start into the procedure. when you answer me back, speak up - speak wp into the microphone, because our downlink is pretty noisy. the first thing we want you to do, and we'll do this on one canis- ter, and then let you go ahead and repeat it on the second. so take one of the lcgs and cut off the outer bag. by cutting along one the heat seals; do it carefully and close to the heat seal, because we may h_ve to use the outer bag if we damage the inner bag. so go ahead and do that, and then we'll do the next step."

"okay. remove the inner bag from the outer bag, cut the inner bag along the heat seal along one side."
"okay. that's correct. do that, and report."
"okay, joe. we've got that done."
"okay, jack. now you can put the lcg itself; that is, take it out of the inner bag, put it in the outer bag, and stow it some place; we recommend u-i, but you can stow it wherever it's convenient."
... outer bag ... _ld stow it back in ...
"okay, joe. we've got that."
"okay. now pick up one of the lithium hydroxide canisters, and let me describe which end is which. it's approximately square on one - one of the vented flat ends, has the strap, and that end we call the top, the end opposite we call the bottom. is that clear? over."
right.
"okay. i've got it, joe."
"okay. now then, we're - we want you to take the tape and cut out two pieces about 3 feet long, or a good arm's length, and what you're - what we want you to do with them is to make two belts around the sides of the canister, one belt near the top and one belt near the bottom, with the sticky side out; wrap it around, sticky side out, as tight as possible. it'll probably take both of you to get it nice and snug. over."
"okay, now -"
okay. now we've got to make the belt real taut here. ape 61/5 03 18 30 2_ cdr how's that? 05 1_ 30 35 c_p real tight. and th_n ...
"okay, joe."
"okay, jack. did you have - - 03 8 33 19 _c - - hey_ houston_ are you reading?"
jack - -
- - we've got the two belts around the top and the one around the bottom all done.
"okay, fine. the next step now is to anchor that tape, and the way we want you to do that is to cut about a 2-foot length off the roll and then tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide. and you'll wrap those around the canister at right angles, more or less, to the tape that you've got so that it goes across the top and across the bottom; and when it goes across the top and the bottom, put it so that it's outboard of the center hole and try to get it over one of the ridges between the screens, so that it won't block the flow. is that clear? over."
"yes, joe. very good."
okay. press on.
okay. i've got a cut length right here and we'll tear it lengthwise ... and i'm going to go around right here at this ridge all the way around at right angles and anchor it ...
yes.
"joe, just to clarify that, sticky end down. right? on the tape that i am putting on now?"
"i didn't quite copy that, jack. say again."
"okay. that will be the sticky end down on the container, right?"
"oh, that's correct. i forgot to say that. that's right. tap,:,61/d pag,41! ()31_35 33 cml' ... hold that one right here, if i can s_t it."
"okay, joe; aquarius. we've got that done."
"okay, jack. the next step is to get the eva cue card and use it to form an arch over the top of the canister; just tuck one short end under one ridge on the top the other one against the ridge on the other side so that it forms a rounded arch over the top of the canister. you see, jack, what we're going to do is slip the bag over this whole assembly and the cue card will serve to keep the bag from being sucked down against the screen. over."
okay. i got the idea.
"okay. and when you've done that, to hold the arch in place, just run a strip of tape across the side of the - that is, across the top of the arch, and anchor it down to the sticky strips along each side. u_ _o no _ ulv_ okay. i got the idea. okay. let me just repeat it here. take a cue card, form an arch over the top, bringing it under the side here. when we're through, run a piece of tape from the sides across the top of that to anchor to the other side."
that's correct.
okay. it worked.
the top .... across the top.
looks like you're going to have to cut the cue card slightly.
"doesn't have to be really ... over that the only thing we're ... we can just take the scissors and cut off the edge here. the only thing this does, jim, is prevent this from being sucked down into the container."
still going to need some more tape. cut off the end. okay. whack off the bottom ....
"okay, joe. we've got that arch built, and it's all taped in securely. 03 ir 43 41 cc okay, jack. the next step is to stop up the bypass hole, which is the hole in the center of the bottom of the canister; we want to stop t!_at up because we don't want to bypass the flow; and i forgot to tell you to get something to stick in that hole. we recommend that you either use a wetwipe, or cut off a piece of sock and stuff it in there, or you could probably even crumble lipsome tape and use that. over. 03 18 _4 13 cmp okay. we'll start plugging up the bypass hole."
okay.
plug that hole. we can either - we can put some either - let's cut a piece of your towel there.
sounds good. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription
"okay, houston; aquarius. we have the bypass hole all plugged up."
"okay, aquarius. the next step is take the inner lcg bag that you cut open, and slip it over the top of the canister, when you do that, orient it so that the ears of the bag, that is, the corners should stick out on the closed end - are oriented along the open ends of the arch, because we're going to snip one of those corners to stick the hose in. pull it down until it fits snugly over the arch. over. 03 18 47 56 cml okay, joe. slip the bag over the canister so that the arch is at the bottom of the bag and that the ears are along oriented along, let's see - i guess it would be - would be at the sides of the arch."
depends on whe you mean by sides - over the - the open ends of the arch.
"right, the open endz of the arch."
"okay. 03 18 49 17 cml okay, joe. we've got that done. i"
"okay. now press the bag against the sticky belts that we put on the sides of the canister. if there is any excess material, just kind of pleat it, so that it makes a fairly tight seal, and then take another 3-foot strip of sticky tape and wrap it around the outside of the bag opposite the bottom - the bottom sticky belt - to make a nice tight seal."
okay. i'll do it. okay. now they want two strips around here to make a tight seal.
"okay, joe. we've got the canister inside the bag, two strips around the sides of the bag, real tight, and both sealed."
"okay; real fine. now there's probably a couple of inches of excess bag sticking our around the bottom of the canister. to prevent this from sucking in against the bottom screen, we'd like you to trim it off with the scissors, and when you've done that, we'd like you to cut two more strips of tape about 12 inches long or so, cut the - tear them lengthwise to get four pieces 12 inches long and 1/2-inch wide, and then use those four strips to secure the bag by passing the strips from the sides of the canister outside the bag around the bottom of the canister and back up the other side, and when you do this, just as you did on the top, make them go outward of the hole and in between the screens. over."
okay. you want me to trim the excess material that's sticking off here; trim it at the edge of that canister? or do you want any excess left ;' over?
"no, you don't need to have any excess. just trim it approximately level."
"okay. let's do that first. 0b 18 54 58 cmp okay. now, joe, you want to cut four strips, 12 inches long each, 1/2-inch in diameter. tape that along the outsides of the bag across the ribs."
okay.
"that's correct, jack. that's just for additional security on the bag. when you get those done, you'll have - you'll have two strips going one way, and the other two will be perpendicular to them."
"okay, houston; aquarius. we've got the four strips in place. ob 18 58 ob cc okay. we're in business now with the bag, and the next step to perform is to get ready to put the red suit hose, either the commander's or the lmp's because we're - we're going to want you to have both of these made up eventually, into the top of the - of the bag, and to do that you, first of all, have to assure that the - that the red hose is separated from the blue hose. i don't know whether this has been done already, but if it hasn't, what you have to do is cut the outer beta-cloth sheath down the full length of the _ of the hoses and then also cut the rubber ties that secure the two hoses together, and the hoses should come apart and the comm cable should - should come off. over. fagc, iii() ,l,, ok_jy. t_d_.eth_ - i'rn go_lg to want to separate th_. red hose from the ue hone by cutting this beln-clc_hh qf_ath ok_%_ rfhat'_ irwork (3 18 59 15 cc okay. o_ 19 00 52 cmp okay, houston_ aquarius. i have the lmp's red hose separated '.r'ren_ i.he e!.hers. 03 9 o1 o0 cc ()kay. rea fine. now the next step _s to cut s diagonal hole in erie ear of the - of the plastic bag near the arch. you can pick either one and cut about, a 1-1/2 or 2 inch diagonal hole, big enough bo sl:ip the red hose through. and when you'w_ dorl(_ l,lml; , you'll jt_st slip the red hose through so that it goes about to the center of the canister, i_l's - it's - it's not critical except t,l_tthe opening should be down, and then ,ape the ml: 1c: the hose wher'e it goes in so that 5!,'_ o nice trod ;,nu_-1. over · 03 19 o 40 cmp oka.v. copy that. we want a 1-1/2 5nth hole right hero at this ear, and put the hose in here, end down and toward the canister and then we tape the seal around here. 03 9 02 10 cmp let's try il. we can always make it bigger ii' we have lo. fred, get those .... the center of the arch. 03 19 02 52 cmi' got to - got bo come in towards the center, all the way to the (;enter. no, no. 03 19 06 7 cmp yes. i (tan't fiet,those big knobs. 03 19 08 39 cm_ ... al we have to do is ... tape around here ... tight fi1.....

"that's correct. go to panel 382. the first one, two, three, four are unchanged. we want sec evap h20 control valve off, and prim evap h20 control valve to off. those both are both counterclockwise. over."
"okay, houston. reading back 382, secondary evaporator h20 control valve's off, and primary evaporator h20 control valve, off."
"that's correct. those are the only changes on 1-13, and there are no changes on 1-14, and you've got it all, jack. over. 03 20 39 01 cml okay. real good, joe .... configures for that panel."
"okay. you can get those configures when you can. and the next order of business i've got for you is a procedure to verify that main bus b is good. and a little after that, we'll want to read up to you, for your future information, a procedure for transferring lm power to the command module. over. 03 20 39 33 cml okay. that sounds good. you want to get this plss configuration done first before you give those other procedures, huh?"
"yes, i think so. stand by 1 second and i'll see if flight has any words for us before you start that."
"jack, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay, we don't have _lything for you. our only concern is that you'i! wake up somebody; is there anybody sleeping right now?"
"no. we're all sitting here eating. i'm just going to get a bite to eat. then i'll write down that switch configuration, or i'll copy the procedure now, if you want."
"yes, okay. understand they are all up. did you say you wanted to copy the other procedure now? over."
i can ii'you want. it's your choice.
"i'd rather you went ahead with the switch con- figuration, jack."
"okay, let's do that and then i'll be back with you."
okay. see you later. and tell jim that deke wants him to go to bed.
okay. i'll tell him that right now.
okay.
"i'll tell you, i'll get my switch set done first before i eat so i won't disturb jim any."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"stand by 1 minute, jack, before you go in there. flight has got one other item for you."
deke wants you to go to bed.
right now.
... like that ... i got up about 1 hour ...
"you know what i thought - i think what we saw venting was the result of our delta-vs stirring up things, popping the relief valve. yes. we don't see anything venting now ...."
"okay, houston. we are standing by. 03 20 44 2 cc aquariu!_ houston. over."
"()kay, ,joe. 03 20 44 j/t cc okay, jack. you can go _lead and set up that switch configuration. what we are discussing is having you activate the main bus tie motor switches a little later on simply to verify that they will be okay, because the batteries are probably getting a little bit cool. but we'll be back to you with a procedure and discussion about that after you get the switch configura- tion set up. over."
"okay, i'm going to go get the switch configura- tion done now before jim goes to bed so i don't disturb him."
okay. real fine.
jim thir_ks deke sounds like frank borman on apollo 8.
(laughter) okay. sorry about that.
"i'm going to give the comm to fred-o, now."
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay, before i hit the sack, joe, i just want to make sure - how are you still planning an"
at 107 and what's the latest find?
"okay, jim. we are still gathering our thoughts on the mcc, but some of the considerations go like this: fido tells us that we can do that correction probably as late as 118 hours, with no significant delta-v penalty, and with plenty of tracking thereafter to make sure that we've done the right thing, and to set you up for a late mcc if we need it, which we probably wouldn't. we are happy with the ptc mode that you are in now, alld, although we are working up a - an ags ptc mode to use after the mid- course correction, we'd kind of like you to stay in this ptc for a while because it is doing good. we are looking at the weather in the landing area. we don't think we'll have a problem but we are checking it real close, ami if ,hcr_.js any (:hanging that we want to do, w,.w;_nt i,_jg_t it irtt_i,hj._mjdcourse c'orre_:tion. ami for'rr'a',onsllk_,t3ml,,wo are consirb_ring possibly delaying the mideourse correction from 104 hours to some timc between there and ll_j. we'd like to know what you think about it. over."
we have no druthers. as long as we do the mid- course and there is plenty of tracking thereafter to correct for another midcourse; that's my only concern.
"okay, jim. roger that. and based on fido's input that he'd like to do it not later than 24 hours before ei, we will be doing it prior to 118 hours."
okay.
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go. u3 _u ,o _o i/v_w question, joe. jim has been talking to me about how we are going to do this midcourse, and awhile back when we went through this power up, we had pulled the stab/control asa breaker. i was wondering - we lost the heaters in the asa - i was wondering how it looked? what kind of shape it's going to be in? 03 20 _9 18 cc okay. stand by on that one, fred."
okay.
"fred, houston."
go ahead.
"roger. i am told that we'd see 38 degrees for that package, and it'll be okay for the burn. we're massaging the detail procedures for this burn at this time and we expect to have a real clean setup to you in plenty of time."
"okay, very good."
"and i don't know if jack passed it on to you, but jack and i just finished logging about 6 hours sleep, each. paso 144_2 03 1!050 5& (jo roger, fred. copy that. is it a ittie chilly up there?"
"yes. we made the mistake of putting up the window shades, which we won't do again; and with this powered-down mode, we're not generating much internally, and it really did get chilly."
yes. i guess you'll have to generate your own heat in there for a while.
deke says unstow the f_er-genie.
okay.
"aquarius, houston. over. 03 20 57 52 tjvfp go ahead, tfouston. f)_20 57 54 cc fred, just wanted to let you know in advance that we're coming up on the redline c02 value for the secondary canister, and we expect to get there in something like a half hour, at which time we'll be asking you to switch over to the command module canisters. i have the rest of that procedure ready and i just wanted to warn you a little bit in advance. over."
"okay. and i've got a question for you, joe."
go ahead.
okay. the - i need to find out if the condensate container that we were going to use to strain some water in on the lunar surface - is that con- tainer also completely airtight? okay to use it to put i'luid in through here in zero g?
"fred, i didn't copy what you wanted to use it for. over."
...
"fred, houston. we'll have to stand by for 1 minute. we are in a noisy state of comm."
"okay. how do you read now, joe?"
"oh, that's much better. go ahead. i/_20 59 _6 i.m_ okay. i w_s just ldorigto _j_ we haven't had ar_overboard waste water dump since clear back _lro_r_dthe olher side of the moon. about this time, we're running out of the bags we've got on board here."
"okay. i'm - i'm stupid this morning, fred. i'm not quite sure what you are getting at. o 2 00 14 lmi okay, joe. we need some place to put the urine."
okay. il sounds to me as if the suggested re- ceptacle is perfectly satisfactory. do you think you can use it in its present configuration?
"oh, yes. we got all the innerconnects - hookups we need, but i wasn't sure if that gadget was devised solely with the 1/6g environment in mind, and whether it might leak somehow in zero g."
"i'll have them verify that, but off the top of my head, i'm sure it's going to be all right. we'll check it, fred."
okay.
"okay. how do you read, joe? 03 21 11 53 lmi houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay, joe. one thing i've noticed, that a couple of circuits there now - the pulse ... - at least the number of them, is markedly de- creased, and ... rather bad and, apparently, that added venting we had out of the service module was some overboard relief valve, maybe letting go, because it appears to have stopped now."
"okay, fred. copy that. thank you."
"houston, aquarius. 03 21 23 7 cc aquarius, houston. go ahead."
what do you read down there for partial pres- sure c027
"oh, let's see. we're reading 6.6 right now, fred. what do you read? 32j 23 ij__ aboltt j'2.5.  gness we've got a __ i '_l _m_ _ _ _g g_gf_ flr_ll_m... i did just get a master alap_vi and no _trmt;innig)lt;we kind of figured that's what it was, with c09 approaching :itslimit. maybe it didn't quite come out here."
"okay. i,etme get a go, and i think it's time for us to go ahead and put these other canisters on_ s,and by !: 03 21 24 08 lp okay. we went to 15 on ,heprimary last night before 1 changed it and-- 03 21 21;16 cc roger th_jt, fred. we wanted to - -"
"- - i don't haye a steady - i don't have a steady ecs light on at this time, joe, so it must have just been a momentary."
"okay. we know when you went to 15 last night on primn,ry. we want to switch out today at 7.6. let me check and see ii'we're ready. 03 21 24 111 lmp okay."
"yes. that's what it is, joe. i've got something going on this alarm ... ecs light."
"fred, houston. the cohm isn't too sharp and i did_ 't copy."
"okay, aquarius; houston - -"
"ttouston, aquarius. how do you read?"
"- - why don't you try it now? you're loud smd clear now, fred. 03 21 26 42 lhp okay. i was just - i'm getting master alarms every few seconds and i am catching a glimmer now of the ecs light. for the time being, i have ... - ... open. okay, now we got the ecs light on steady."
"okay. copy that. you have the master alarm, with the ecs light. we are ready to go ahead and get you on the command module canisters. and as the first step, i'd like to know whether you've inserted the commander's red hose to the second canister bag. over. t'b_o 63/14 03 21 27 29 i_ okay. y_s. sure enough; the comma_der's red hose is inserted into the canister bag."
"okay, fi'ed. the next thing i'd like you to do is to tsd_esome more gray tape and tape over half the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles; the co_ander's and the lmp's. the reason we're doing this is we're going to be running this loop through the secondary lioh canister hole with the canister removed_ and we don't have the flow restriction we need to keep the separator from overspeeding. over."
"okay. yes, that's right. so we want to tape over half of the - both the blue and the red commander hoses. is that right?"
"negative, fred. that's half of the cormnander's blue hose and half of the lmi's blue hose - the outlet hoses. 03 21 28 3 lmp oh_ okay. i'll tape over half of each of the outlets. stand by."
okay.
"okay. i'm going to turn off one suit flow valve at a time while i am doing the taping, joe."
"say again, please, fred."
"okay, while i'm doing the taping, i' have that particular suit flow valve in the suit discon- nect position momentarily."
okay. fine.
"okay. how do you read now, joe?"
"okay, fred. reasonable comm. are you ready for the next step? over."
okay. one correction - the red hose that's con- nected up right now to the lithium cartridge in the lmp's - wait a minute.
"okay, fred. understand only the lmp's red hose is actually plugged into the canister bag. in that case, we would like you to follow the pro- cedure for inserting the other red hose in the other canister bag as follows: you cut a diag- onal hole in one corner of'the bag. look at the oher bag and see how it was done. stick the hose in about 6 _nches. try to get the outlet nozzle down if you can, or else sideways, and then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a nice tight seal. over."
okay. jack's back in here. i guess he can do that. stand by.
okay.
"how do you read, joe?"
"okay, fred. is that done? over."
"no. that's still in works. i just wanted to comment you might pass on to steve grega, we thank you a lot for those rendezvous procedures. they went to making up these little boxes."
"okay. we appreciate your appreciating it. we're oust _aving a ball down here working on all kinds of new procedures, fred. the cpcb is in session, and we expect to have your entry procedures out here by saturday or sunday at the very latest."
saturday or sunday?
at the very latest!
"take your time, jack."
why don't you run that other hose back up in the tunnel so jim can get some air.
yes. i got it.
"and joe, how you read now?"
"satisfactory, fred. go ahead."
okay. back to the condensate container. i guess the only question i really need answered is will it leak?
"is will it leak? oh, yes. stand by 1."
"and we've checked all the fittings and i know i can hook everything up to our ucds. so, if it doesn't leak, we can transfer."
"okay, fred. we still don't have a final answer on whether or not it'i leak. if you need it, i'8 go ahead and use it; and standing by for your completion of the hose-insertion procedure."
okay. the hose-insertion procedure ... the second cartridge is complete.
okay. that's complete. the next step is to switch to the primary co2 canister and remove the secondary canister and stow it. over.
okay. i'm going to have to get off comm here; i'll let jack get the headset.
okay.
"hey, joe. i'm on the headset now."
is that secondary? ... secondary?
both cartridges are out.
"okay, joe. fred has the secondary cartridge out. we're back on primary now."
"okay, jack. the next step is to place the com- mand module canisters with the hoses attached in a suitable location to permit the bottom of the canister to be exposed to free airflow and tape them in place. ideally, well, it doesn't matter. just - just pick out your own spot. a_0ll0 13 air-tc)-oroui_d vt)ice tiallscripteli ,v...... _,), / 1 t'a_tu 4ht_"
"okay. i'm _,?i,lc_to toll you where they are. they're both situated, as you say, with the bottom o? the canister exposed to free air, and one is sitting right by the - the lmp's is sit- ting right by the eps panel, and the cdr's is up in 'the llililioi."
"jack, houston. the c0_ gob real noisy there, and i didn't copy that_ stand by a moment."
"okay, joe. how do you read now?"
"okay. that's rea good, jack; go ahead."
okay. the canisters are situated as you - as you would like with the bottom of the eanister exposed lo ?re_: a_r. 0b 21 56 17 cc okay.
"the position of the lmp's canister - the lmp's canister is sitting on the eps panel now, and the cdr's canister is positioned up in the tun- nel."
"okay. ileal fine, jack. the next step is to physically separate both blue hoses a good dis- tance away from the canister so that we don't short circuit the flow, and tape them in place; and the ideal location for th_m would be up in the turmel so as to get, _:ome flow into the com- mand modtd e. over."
both hoses in the - up into the command module?
"oh, you can use your judgment on that, jack. we'd like at leash one, arid the recon_nendation that i got was bo put them both up in the tun- nel."
"okay. we have the lmp's blue hose up by the lmp's window and the - of course, the red hose is separated by some 4 feet. and the - okay. we're going to - and the other hose - the - has the extension on it - the cdr's blue hose, of course, has the extension on it, and it's blow- ing way up in the command module. and the red hose is about - oh, it's right at the docking ring where the blue latches are, so there's about 4 or 5 feet difference from there, too. is this satisfactory? tripe 64/2 i'l?'_' 44_)"
"okay, jack. that sounds satisfactory. the next steps are - are suit-loop conl'iguration steps, and the first one is to"
okay. suit div - -
- - is to place the suit diverter valve to the i'ullegress position.
okay. suit diverter valve to pull egress.
that's affirmative - -
that's done - -
okay. the next step is cabin gas return to egress. over.
...
"()kay, jack. did you copy cabin gas return to 03 2 59 32 cmp no, i didn't get that, joe. cabin gas return to egreso."
that's correct.
okay. that's done.
"okay. next, suit circuit relief to close. over."
suit circuit relief to close.
roger.
okay. i got that done.
"okay. and the last step is select secondary co2 canister. we'll let it flow through the empty hole, and let's see how we do."
select secondary c02 canister.
"roger, jack. that completes that procedure, and the next thing i've got for you is a procedure for going back into the connnand module and power- ing up the main buses temporarily using the bus tie switches. we want to do this for two reasons: first of all, we want it absolutely verified that tap_ 64/3 i','l_(, ._i50 there arc:no loads on the main buses, that we've got:everythijtg of'l'and that the buses look good; and the second thing we want to do is to power the bus - the main buses, with the bus tie motor switches, and then depower them by pulling the circuit breakers, leaving the main bus tie switches in the on position, just to assure that they'll be there when we need them, whether the batteries get cold or not. over."
"0kay, joe. how you read?"
"better now, jack. satisfactory. did you copy my rationale for the main bus powerup?"
"yes, i did. you want to remove - you want to power up both buses, with the bus tie motor switches; first of all, to see that there are no loads on tho buses, and second, and then depower the buses by pulling the circuit breakers to insure that the motor switches don't - that the bus ties stay on so that they're there when we need them."
"that's correct, jack. are you ready to copy the procedure?"
okay. go ahead.
"okay. as the first step, i have one change to the basic configuration that we gave you, and it's two more circuit breakers that we want open. on panel 225 - are you ready to write that down? over."
"yes. i'm all ready, joe. go ahead."
"joe, i'm all ready. go ahead."
"okay. on panel 225, we want the rendezvous transponder flight bus circuit breaker open, and the s-band _n transmitter/dse flight bus circuit breaker open. over."
"okay. tv re1tdezvous transp0hfder flight bus, open; tv s-band transmitter/dse flight bus open on panel 225."
"okay. that's correct, jack. and now we'll go into the main bus powerup procedure. and the first step there, is on panel 5- we want the bat charger bat a charge circuit breaker closed, and the bat charger bat b charge circuit breaker closed. over."
"okay. that's bat charger bat a ctarge, bat charger bat b charge, both closed on panel 5."
"that's affirmative. we need them closed to power the switches. next on panel 5, we want the eps sensor signal main a and main b circuit breakers closed. over."
"okay. panel 5, cb eps sensor's signals main a and main b closed."
"okay. that's affirmative. we need them closed so that you can read out your volts and amps. next step, on panel 250, we want circuit breaker bat a power entry and postlanding and bat b power entry and postlanding, closed. over."
"okay on panel 250, cb bat a power, entry and postlanding, closed; bat b power entry and post- landing, closed."
"that's affirmative. and at that point, we'd like you to check the bat bus voltages on both bat buses to make sure we don't have any shorts. over."
okay. read the bat bus voltages on bat bus a and bat bus b.
"that's affirmative. the next step on panel 275: circuit breaker main a, bat bus a, closed, and circuit breaker main b, bat bus b, closed. over."
"okay. on 275, circuit breakers main a, bat bus a, closed; main b, bat bus b, closed."
"that's affirmative. _e next step on panel 5: we want the main bus tie a/c switch to the bat a/c position, and verify proper voltage on main bus a, and read the amps on bat a to make sure we don't have a short. over."
okay .... pag_452
"okay, dack_ houston. we're in had comm again; let's wait a minute."
okay. how do you read ...?
"that's better, jack. go ahead with your read- back_"
"okay. place main bus tie a/c, on, read main bus a current and voltage."
okay. that's affirmative. the next step will be the main bus tie b/c switch to the on position and read main b voltage and battery b amperage as above. over.
"okay, main bus tie b/c on; read main b voltage and current."
"okay. that is correct. then to reconfigure from this configuration, jack, we want you to leave the mai_ bus tie switches in the on posi- tion and pull the circuit breakers out in reverse order that we had you close them. over; and do you want me to read them up individually?"
"no, let me see if i've got it here. i go down to panel 275, open cb main a, bat bus a and cb main b, bat bus b. then i go down to 250, and pull cb bat a power entry/postlanding and bat b power entry/postla_ding and then up on panel 5, pull eps sensor signal main a, sensor signal main b, battery charger bat b charge, battery charger bat a charge. and then close - i don't know whether you want me to close the rendezvous radar transponder flight bus and s-band transmitter/dse flight bus."
"okay, jack. we don't want you to close those last two. those are changes to your basic con- figuration, and we want to leave them open for now. over."
okay. i'll do that. was the rest of the read- back okay?
"that's correct. readback was 100 percent, and we'll wait to hear from you."
"okay, joe. and just for confirmation, i went through the switch list you gave me. we are in exactly that configuration with one exception, and that is over on panel 382. i have not, the a - h20 accumulator is in the off position so that if we need any more water, we can get it."
"okay. roger, jack. copy that. on panel 382, you've left the h20 accumulator valves in the off position, and we concur."
"okay. and there's one other thing that i don't know whether you're aware of. we have no lithium hydroxide canisters in panel two fif- in - can- isters now. so when we get ready to power up, you'll have to remind us when you want us to add some."
"okay, jack. we copy that. that's correct, and i'll add that to our basic checklist so that we won't forget it."
"okay. real fine, joe, and i'm on my way back into the command module."
good deal.
thank you.
"how do you read, joe?"
"and, joe, how do you read aquarius?"
"aquarius, houston. pretty good. go ahead."
"okay. i'm back on the line now, but jack really .., headed back to the upstairs bedroom."
"okay. roger that, fred."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay, fred. we recommend that you push your master alarm circuit breaker in so you'll have audio and visual on that, and, also, we medical types are getting to feel left out down here, and we'd like you to give us biomed ... position, if you're plugged in for it, and we'll see whether it affects the voice or not. over. fage 454"
okay.
"hey, houston; aquarius. on down voice backup s-band, how do you read me?"
"aquarius, houston. read you now satisfactory. or 22 14 36 t,mp okay_ _am_dthat's _rrs ,,,"
"okay. thank you very much, fred."
"actually, a good deal of that little power pack heats up and ..."
roger that.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go a_lead."
"okay, jack just ... himself back down. and after he put on the 250 bat a, bat b breakers, he read bat bus volts as 32.3 on a, 37.0 on b; he then punched in the 275 breakers, which tied the batteries to the buses, and at that time he read the a bus volts 32.0 on a, zero amps; 37.0 on b, zero amps."
"aquarius, houston. the comm got noisy there, and i want to make sure we get these numbers right, so i'd like to ask you to repeat them .."
"okay. how do you read now, joe?"
"okay; probably okay, fred. read it nice and slow so we'll be sure to get it. over."
"okay. jack pushed in the 250 bat a, bat b entry breakers. iferead battery bus volts as 32.3 on a, 37.0 on b. then he pushed in the 275 breakers tying the bats to the main buses. in this con- figuration, main a is at 32.0 volts, zero amps; main b is at 37.0 volts, zero amps. so it looks like the buses are okay."
"okay, fred. copy those numbers and thank you very much. i assume you got them off all right."
that's affirm. we got all the breakers pulled again.
okay. real fine.
"hey, houston; aquarius. how do you read?"
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
okay. how did our ... configurations appear to be working down there?
i'm sorry_ fr_d_ but we got noisy again there.
okay. let me know when you want me to try it.
okay. that sounds better already. go ahead.
okay. i'd just like to ... how's - how's our lith-o cartridge setup ... appear to be working down there.
"we are reading 0.2 on our c02 sets here, and wefre all delighted. it seems to be working fine."
"boy, that is great."
"amd fred, houston. in a little while here, i'm going to have a procedure that i want to read up to you and have you copy down for futture use. it's a procedure for powering the command module main bus off the lm, and it's something that we feel that's going to come in real handy later on for such things as popping off the command module entry batteries, and also possibly for doing some preheating and preliminary powering up of the command module before we get rid of the lm. we'll have that for you in probably 10 or 15 minutes. over."
"okay, okay, joe. that's good. sounds good."
roger.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, fred. our procedure-generating mill has generated another very short one for you here. it's a procedure for getting an onboard read-out - -"
"stand by 1, joe."
"okay. 0 22 37 02 lmp okay, joe. go ahead. 0_ 22 37 05 cc okay, fred. this is a procedure for getting a read-out of the desce_lt propellant tank temps. it's no big problem, but our lm people say that the bottom of the descent stage is probably cool- ing off, and we just want to verify that the descent water tar_ will be okay. right now, it looks as though it won't freeze until several hours after it's empty, but we want to have you read these temperatures out to us so we can see how good our predictions are. the procedure is, on panel 16, close the propellant displaytengine override logic circuit breaker. over."
okay. the propellant display override circuit breakers are closed .... the propellant.
"right, fred. the next step is simply to turn the propellant temp press monitor switch to descent 1, read the fuel and ox temps, turn it to descent 2, read the fuel and ox temps; tell us what they are."
"okay. on descent 1, i get a fuel temp of 66.5 degrees, ox ... on desce_ 2, i get ..."
"okay, fred. we're in noisy comm here; i got descent 1 fuel 66.5; stand by a second."
"okay. how do you read, now ...?"
that's better. go ahead.
"okay. you got 66.5 on descent 1 fuel temp, oxidizer temp is 66 degrees."
okay. copy - -
"on descent tank 2, fuel is reading 60 - okay. descent 2 fuel is reading 68 degrees; oxidizer, 65 degrees."
"okay. copy that, fred. thank you. we'd like you to pull the circuit breaker, and we'll prob- ably come to you again in 5 or 6 hours for another check."
okay. the panel 16 ...... engine ... override is open. 03 22 )4019 cc roger.

"okay. we're chasing a small glitch that we saw a while ago in the 02 flow rate which is now normal again, but what we'd like you to do is, first of all, to tell us whether, during that canister procedure, you moved 02 d_and reg a to any position other than cabin, and then we'd like you to move it to off momentarily and back to cabin for us. 03 22 47 39 lmf okay. to answer your question, joe, it's no. i checked the cabin all the time. qualitatively, _.._..._..w.e.._.r._.t.c.h_ to this configuration, it didn't seem like the frequency or the suit fan noise ... decreased ... logged down a little bit, but i'll follow your procedure. you want me to take reg a, go to close and back to cabin; is that correct?"
"that's correct, fred."
okay. we're in close.
okay.
"now, i'm back to cabin."
"okay. thank you very much, fred. i'll get back to you if we see anything."
(music - the age of aquarius)
... thank you.
"hey, have you guys got a woman on board? 03 22 50 57 hip no way i could handle that."
"and, joe, do you have the ... out for the ...?"
"i'm not sure i copied that, fred. if you asked me whether i had that powerup procedure, i don't have it for you, yet. over. 03 22 5l 54 lm? no. the question was, do you have a ... from the moon burn."
"still didn't understand, fred. i'm sorry."
okay. we'll be able to get better comm.
roger.
okay.
"fred, houston. you want to try it, now?"
"how do you read, houston?"
"that's pretty good, fred."
"okay. two things: first of all, we noticed a ,.o ns oo _h _n _ _l darn _ z_t _ you started ta!king_ it got noisy again, fred; try it again."
okay.
"try it now, loud and slow."
okay. jack had a question on how far out from the moon are we now?
on how far out what?
from the moon we are now?
oh. our little plot shows you just touching the 180-thousand-mile line. so you're about 40 k out from the moon.
"okay. okay. and the other thing is, we've noticed some fresh new particles floating around outside, so possibly the service module is start- ing to vent a little bit again."
"okay. copy that, fred. on the 02 flow thing, we clearly saw the demand regulator go to off and back to cabin. tel,mu ? thinks that it's no big thing that you've seen a little change in flow due to the different resistance we've got in the circuit."
roger.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead. n_u__-oo_v__/_ _cv okay, fred. recommend you _o to off on the biomed switch. we never did get any biomed and it might clear up the comma little bit."
okay. owyou read now?
"okay, fred. that might be a little better."
"we're on the 180 - k line, right now."

we're about 40 050.

"okay. stand by. i'll tell him, now."
okay.

"yes. ,joe,how long is it? is it a big long one, or a short one, or a medium sized ... about how many pages?"
"it's about - i'd say 15 to 20 steps, jack. some of it is lm stuff, and the rest of it is in csm."
"okay. i got a fresh page here, and i'm ready to copy."
"okay. i'll give you the lm steps first. they have to be done first, and the first step is on panels 11 and 16, circuit breakers ascent ca, asc eca, two to close."

"okay. good deal. we copy that, fred. and to show you how relaxed we are about the entry, ken is looking at - giving you guys a chance to - prior to going into entry, prep to snap a few pictures of the service module."
"ken is, huh? (laughter)"
"yes, he's got all that film up there, and he doesn't want to waste it."
"oh, i thought maybe you'd want me to do a plss eva to go shoot pictures or something."
"okay, okay."
you're right; we got a lot of pictures.
"i guess i agree it surely would be nice to docu- ment it someway _f we can, but it doesn't look like ..."
"yes, we think it'd be a lot of help."
"joe, how do you read me?"
aquarius_ houston. go ahead.
okay. the condensate transfer worked great.
"stand by a min_e, fred. we're in a bad comm mode."
okay. how's that?
that's better.
"okay. the waste transfer into the condensate can works real well, joe."
okay. good deal.
"so, i guess we can keep fid0 happy with no over- board dumps."
"roger that. 03 23 27 14 l_ yes, that brings up one more possibility, joe."
"say again_ fred. 03 23 27 23 lmi' brings up another possibility. now that we've got all of that stowed into the bags and the condensate can, we could probably blow all of that through the plss ..., i wonder how the sublimator woald work on waste water."
"it might work if we had to do it, fred. end of tkpe apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription tape ro)_/,_"
"that brings up one more possibility, joe."
"say again, fred."
"brings up another possibility. now we've got all that stowed and the bags and the condensate can, we can probably blow all of that through the plss setting. i wonder how the sublimator would work on waste water."
"it might work if we had to do it, fred. right now we're looking at a comfortable excess of water through the sublimator. we were talking among ourselves this morning about having you try out the plss to ascent tank water-transfer situation and we decided not to do it, not to recommend it, because we figure it'd take us 30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks, which you have to do in order to get plss water to it, and we'd rather use the descent water and we don't think we've gotten any sweat. over."
"okay, joe. i don't think there's any question about it from the plumbing standpoint that we could do that if we had to."
okay. copy that.
"and, how do you read, joe?"
"read you pretty good, fred. go ahead."
"i think our ptc wobble is growing worse. the earth now is really up to the top of the window. i have to get way down almost to the floorboards to view it. conversely, the moon is way down at the bottom of the window."
okay.
a lot more wobble.
roger - -
far more wobble than i noticed on my previous watch.
"okay. copied that, fred. and our thermal people will be looking at it. one of the things we're talking about reative to the midcoul'se correc- tion is we'd like not to do it before thc siietm_k goes, if it's going to go, just so it won't give us a problem reestablishing ptc. and right now our people think that the burst disk will pop around 106 hours."
okay. 03 23 h4 27 lmp the l-shaped bag is ...
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay, fred. since you went ahead and used the plss condensate container, we got the procedure in for using it. i'm not going to read it up to you except that it cautions a little bit about shaking it too much or about filling it too full, because they feel that if you do that the vent valve might unseat and the bag might leak a little bit. over."
"okay. we haven't removed it from its stowage spot. we just left it right in place, and just - he mated the tank at the end of the cable and hooked right into that."
understand. that's satisfactory and recommended that you leave it in the stowage spot. that should help the situation.
roger.
"we got a - we got another flow shower going on outside. particles, seeing them vented against the service module. jack thinks it may be an h2 vent ...."
"okay. copy that. what window are you looking at it out of, fred?"
out the lm docking window.
"the docking window. roger that. somebody just handed me your latest consumables status report, and you're using between 11 to 12 amps an hour real steady, and it looks real good."
roger.
"joe, what are you showing for get now?"
"i think you wanted the get, jack, and the present get is 96 hours 21 minutes. over."
"okay, thank you."
okay.
"and jack, houston. for your information, fido tells me that we are in the earth's sphere of influence and we're starting to accelerate."
i thought it was about time we crossed. thank you.
roger.
we're on our way back home.
"there's something that puzzles me, joe. vance mentioned yesterday that the planned entry is a cmc-guided entry, so i'm kind of curious as how are we going to get the alinement."
did you say how we're going to get guidance? over.
no. how are we going to get a platform alinement?
"okay. we got a number of interesting ideas on that and the latest one i've heard is to power up the lm platform and aline it, and aline the cm platform to it."
okay. that sounds good.
"okay. and we're working out detailed procedures on that, jack."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, joe."
okay. we are taking our final look at the mid- course procedures and we have a question as to the tape 65/_ present position of one of the switches. the switch is the ags status switch on panel 6. we'd just like to know where it's at. 04 00 37 27 cm_ okay. stand by.
"okay, joe. the ags status switch is off."
okay. off. thank you. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay, vance. i just heard a little thump, sounded like down in the descent stage, and i saw a new shower of snow flakes come up that looked like they were emitted from down that way. we've already decided though - i wonder what the supercrit pressure looked like now."
"okay. understand you saw a thump in the descent stage and a few snow flakes. we'll take a look down here, see if we see anything."
"aquarius, houston."
"aquarius, houston. 04 01 16 l0 _ go ahead."
"fred, we don't see any%hing wrong. for example, your she appears to be okay as far as we can see. the thing we don't have data on, is the ... tank down there. 04 o1 16 30 _ okay. and i doubt if it would have been that anyway."
okay. while we have you on the horn - -
we're still getting -
roger. still getting it.
go ahead.
"while you're on the horn, be advised our calcu- lations show you might be running out of potable water in the csm pretty soon. also, that you might start to have hydrogen tank venting in the csm and a question. next time jack looks through the sextant and telescope, we'd like him to see how it looks. do you have any%hing on the optics, any specks or anything?"
"okay, ... 04 01 20 05 i24p houston, aquarius. how do you read?"
"aquarius, we read you 4 by 4. go ahead."
"okay. it looks like the ptc is deteriorated enough that ... the docking window of the i/_, and ..."
"aquarius, houston. we got part of your trans- mission. understand the ptc has deteriorated quite a bit and you'd like to know what to do about it. is that affirm? 04 01 21 10 imp negative. how do you read now, vance?"
okay. a little better.
"okay. the only comment was that it has deterio- rated to where the moon is now coming through the overhead docking window now, in a portion of each pass, and about that time i just lose comm on either antenna, so there's going to be a short period of time on each revolution where we're not going to have comm."
"okay, fred. we understand that and one more item for clarification on the water. we don't really know what your usage of potable is. that was purely an estimate assuming a fairly healthy usage. 04 o1 21 57 _ okay."
"hey, houston; aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay. jack just took a look through the optics - through one rev, and he said they look good, loud and clear. he doesn't have any current condensate on either the sextant or telescope."
"okay, fred. thanks for the info."
"how do you read, vance?"
"okay. i'm reading you weakly, fred. go ahead. tape 66/1 04 01 36 17 _ with all this other procedures you've been working o_ there, i thought i was going to have a new one for you. how to get four ginger- bread cubes apart; i think they were stuck together with epoxy."
this is in the food bag? 04 01 36 59 i24p yes.
that's to stand loads of launch and boost. 04 01 37 07 i/4p roger. tool b did the trick. 04 o1 37 28 ilvgo yes.
"hey, fred. john says you can use the dikes on it to get them apart."
"yes, that probably wouldn't have crumbled them as badly."
"i generally don't use the subtle approach. you can tell wetre feeling pretty good, vance, when we start complaining about the food."
yes. that's good to hear.
"i think everybody's feeling better down here, too,"
"aquarius, houston. 04 01 41 20 i24p go ahead."
"fred, we have you on the goldstone bie dish now, and our comm is much better. if you'd like would you turn the biomed switch on to either crewman there. 04 o1 41 36 i24p okay. stand by. i'll have to plug in first."
okay.
"okay, vance. how do you read on baseband."
we read you just - stand by.
"okay, fred. we're receiving your med data; it was a little slow in coming in. r_= 474 04 01 43 09 imp okay."
"houston, aquarius. are you calling?"
negative. no call from here.
okay.
"and, vance, this is aquarius. 04 02 26 t9 cc go ahead, fred. 04 02 26 23 imp okay. jim's coming back on the line, and i'll be unhooking on the biomeds, and you want us to go back to the spa down voice backup?"
"stand by. 04 02 26 48 imp okay. jim doesn't have his biomed rigged on right now, so ... down voice ..."
"okay, fred. you're too weak on that last. i understand youtre disconnecting, and your biomed will be off. say again about jim, please. 04 02 27 24 _ okay. how do you read now?"
okay.
okay. all i said was jim doesn't have his biomed rigged right now so i'll go back to down voice backup spa and jim's coming on the line.
okay. we copy you're in down voice backup.
"well, i'm thinking about the last l0 hours. we've lost our suit compressors."
because we don't want to use the power.
"well, that's what i'm saying. we can use these fans right here and use the circulate air right through the use of those fans."
are we on mike now?
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"roger, jim. good morning."
"good morning, vance. how's things going down there?"
"oh, quiet and smooth."
"oh, it's afternoon down there."
right. we thought maybe it was morning to you.
"well, i've sort of lost track. but i had a good sleep."
glad to hear it. doctor just said he wondered how many hours?
"oh, let's say whenever i left jack, and fred came up and we ate for about an hour, and then i went to bed, so whatever that time was. it must be about 5 hours, something like that; 4 or 5 hours."
good. glad to see you catching up.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, vance."
"jim, the next time that it's convenient, could you get the readout of the repress package in the command module for us? over. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice ti_n_,cription"
will do.
okay.
"when you go back there, fred, they want tile repress package readout."
we don't want you to wake anyone up to get it.
no. no one's asleep now.
it has? .... was it? ... you get forward to it and a pretty good view of the venting.
"and, houston, aquarius. it looks like service module venting has ceased, at least momentarily."
roger. understand service module venting has ceased momentarily. how about the descent stage? does fred report venting down there? do you still see that?
stand by.
what is your report on descent stage venting - was it venting? anytl_ing else going on? any more venting?
no.
no. fred hasn't seen anything else from the descent stage. and i understand that we can expect the - the she - tank pressure to build up to relief here about 105 hours.
roger. a little later than that - like 106 - 107.
okay.
did you get some interior photos?
yes.
okay. i'd like to show them the arrangement of these hydroxide canisters. do you have?
"aquarius, houston."
did they give jack any more procedur_s o:iconmiand module powerup?
...
did they give jack any more procedures on com- maad module powerup?
"well, they think it might be up here."
okay.
"the main thing we got to think about, _id when we have to get to them, is the procedures for lm jettison, the transfer of the lm to csm mode (cough), lm jettison."
...
yes.
... the lm mode?
"ail we have to do is turn the biomed ... on, and we'll be in there."
"houston, aquarius."
"roger. go ahead, aquarius."
"we would like permission to turn the biomed on to get off the hot mike mode. i don't think that we have to be on it now if you have the big dish on, do you?"
"yes. yaw's coming - or roll's coming up for it, and we were going to burn."
"roger, jim. we concur. go ahead and turn it on."
okay. fine; thank you.
"one other point. the philosophy of timing this midcourse is based a little bit on doing it just before the she tank is supposed to vent. that way, we hope that we would have - - be powered up and you would have control when the venting occurs, in case you were tossed around a little bit. over."
"okay. underztand. philosophy on the midcourse i:; doinl_ il, prior to venting oi' the ;lie tank, which me,ms we'll be doing this around 105 hours, i suppose, or 105:30 _md so i'll have control of the spacecraft if it should give us some per- turbation."
"roger. then, after that, we would establish ptc again."
roger.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
our repress package pressure is 820.
okay. repress pressure 820. thank you.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, could you switch your biomed switch to the position opposite to where it is now? we are getting a subcarrier, but no data. over."
"now you know, houston, i don't have riomed on."
"okay. and we have a small addition to the pro- cedure that was read up to you earlier, which involves power transf_r from the lm to the csm."
stand by 1.
okay.
"okay, houston. go ahead."

"okay. after the step bat 5 and 6, off, step 3 will be circuit breakers panels 11 and 16 ascent eca control, both oper,."
"that's correct, jim. and this is to guard against a single-point failure that - a remote possibility that would preclude you from getting the batteries back on. jap: 67/4 04 02 _' 04 cd!! roger,"
go ahead.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim."
"okay. we just had a battery warning .., bat- tery 2."
"stand by, jim. the comm's no good here right now."
"houston, aquarius. how do you read now?"
go ahead. loud and clear.
"okay. we just had a battery warning master alarm, and it looks like it's battery 2."
roger.
"roger, houston - this is houston. could you close the power amp circuit breaker, and we'll get some high bit rate?"
roger.
it's closed.
okay. and we need high bit rate.
"are you picking it up, houston?"
roger. and we want t open the bal load cross tie on panel 16. over.
say again.
open the bal load cross tie breaker on panel 16. over.
open balance load cross tie breaker on 16. roger.
that's affirm.
it's open.
"if you're getting high bit data, we could do an off/reset and go back on on battery 2. we're standing by for that."
"okay. could you turn off battery 2, and leave it off and let us look at it?"
"say again. you want us to turn off battery 2, and leave it off until you look at it?"
that's affirmative.
okay. battery 2 coming off the line.
"okay, aquarius. so you want to stay in this configurazion for awhile, and let's look at the battery."
roger. we'll stay in this configuration.
want to close the bal loads circuit breaker back now.
"13, houston. we want to close the bal loads circuit bremker on panel 16 now, again."
we have it closed; the closed - balance loads circuit breaker is closed.
roger.
"aquarius, houston. request range functions switch to range ..."
ail right. range functions switch going to range.
right-o.
"aquarius, houston."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, on the battery problem, we have determined that it is not overcurrent or reverse current. we suspect it's over-temp, but donrt know for sure, so we're going to watch it for awhile."
"okay. 0_ ok o0 20 cc aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, charlie has some procedures to read up for you here; i think you'll need your activiation checklist, if it's ha_ldy."
"aquarius, that's the contingency checklist."
"okay. i'll just - okay. stand by, charlie."
"okay, charlie. i've got the contingency check- list, and standing by."
"okay, jim. we'd like you to turn to page - page 24, which is the ""30-minute activation,"" and this is going to be a procedure for the mid- course burn that we got coming up at 105 with the ags up. over."

"i don't think we'll need it, charlie."
"okay; fine, jim. on row 2, under rcs system a: ascent feed 2 and ascent feed 1 should be open. under flight displays: mission timer should be open; gasta, open; ordeal, open. under ac bus a: gasta, open. the rest are as shown on the page. over."

"say that again, charlie."
"okay. under the last row, under eps is the only delta and that is under the cross tie bus. it should go open. over."
roger. the cross tie bus should go open.

"that's affirmative, jim, going on to page 29. we've got - at this point, there ts a write-in required. it's about a six or seven liner, and i'll try to go fairly slowly and let you write it down, if you're ready to copy. over."
ready to copy.
"okay. at thi_;poj_nt, w_'d lik_ you to ""verify rcs heaters in afpofor 15 minutes."""
"is that the first step, charlie? 04 0h 15 20 cc that's affirmative. what we're trying to do here is we're getting you set up in an attitude so you can damp your rates and come out of ptc. and this is the configuration i'm reading you now, the next - in the next six lines, the procedure for getting you into a configuration to damp the rates and stop ptc. over."
"okay. so the first thing will be to - ""go to auto on the rcs system a and b""? oh 04 15 50 cc it's the ""verify that the heaters have been in alpo for 15 minutes."" back on the first page of this procedure, you put the heaters in auto and you pushed the breakers in, and we'd like for them to warm up the quads for 15 minutes before we start to - stop at - stopping ptc. over."
"roger, ""verify heaters rcs on for 15 minutes."""
"okay. step 2: ""balance couple, off; dead band, minimum; attitude control: pitch and roll to pulse; yaw to direct; mode control: ags, att hold; guidance control to ac_$;damp rates; pitch and roll with the ttca, yaw with the aca with the earth in the front window."" over."
"okay, let's see if i got it. step 2 is ""balance couple 's off; dead band, min; attitude control: pitch and yaw at pulse; yaw, direct. mode con- trol will be in ags, att hold; guidance control will be in ags; we'll damp the rates; pitch and roll with the ttca, and yaw with the aca; and we'll probably have to have some reference point, so i have to try and stop on the earth."" over."
"roger, jim. we were hoping that in your ptc that you occasionally see the earth coming through the window; and, if that's true, then we'd like you to have to - just damp the rates with the earth in the forward window. and then we '11 give you the burn attitude via the forward window on the earth momentarily. over."
"roger. 01_04 18 46 cc okay '?batwas the entire procedure for d_mmping the rates, only - though i only gave you - said it was step 2, that was the entire procedure. now, continuing on to what's printed on page 29 - correction, you had one error in the readback under attitude control. it was pitch and roll to pulse; yaw to direct. continuing on, on page 29 with the printed procedure, the _'irst four lines, scratch. step 3, scratch. under ""ags activation,"" one change: add a step. first step will be ""verify asa cb(16) in for 10 minutes."" the rest of the ags activation is as printed. over."
"okay. ""verify asa circuit breaker 16 in for 10 minutes""; and, i take it, 10 minutes back in our procedures we'll have a note saying to put that in. 0_ 0_ 20 14 cc it's - the circuit breaker goes itlon the cir- cuit bre'_ker activation page, jim. so, by the time we get here and have the rates all damped, we feel that - that the pipas will be mp to temperature by this time, and we can go ahead and turn it - turn the ags on at this time. over. but we just want you to verify that."
"okay. and one other question, charlie. i'd like to know if the note you gave me about damping the rates is before the other information on page 29."
"that's affirmative. add that in to the top of the page. the - what we're really doing - let's - let's put it in to right before the ""ags acti- vation.'' the other - the other procedure on the top of the page belongs with the ""dap set gimbal trim,"" and we're just omitting all of that pro- cedure. so the addition that - on the damping, the rates should really go in right before the ""ags activation."" over."
understand.
"what we're really trying to do is get you in a posture so that when you see the earth come through the window, you can damp her out and hold - hold the earth in the window. proceeding on to the rest of page 29, under ""rcs press,"" scratch the entire three steps as printed. on page 30_ scratch step 4 under the ""rcs press."" over."
"roger. under ""ags activation,"" well, i included that step on the asa circuit breaker and we'll do step 1 a_ld2 _lder ""ags activation."" but then we'jl scratch steps 1, 2, and 3 under ""rcs press"" and, on page 30, we'll scratch step 4."

"okay. under ""dps press,"" we'll scratch the first line and we'll have the ""descent helium reg, talkback to barber pole."" we'll scratch steps 2 and 3, and we'll scratch the ""landing gear deploy."""
"roger. now we got, on the back of page 30, jim, you've got a blank page in your checklist, or should have, and we'd l_ke to add a procedure to get you to burn attitude. over."
okay. a procedure to get the burn attitude.
"okay. first statement is a statement: ""verify ags in operate for 5 minutes."" then we go to ""ags address 400 plus 5, then 400 plus zero. a_itlrde control: pitch and roll to pulse; yaw, mode control. maneuver using ttca pitch and roll."" the computer is controlling yaw, but you can over- ride with aca. you with me? over."
"okay, charlie. i'm with you so far."
"okay, jim. ""when in attitude, aca out of detent to zero error needle. then set vent timer,"" and we'll give you a countdown on that when you get to that step. over."
"okay. ""when in attitude, aca out of detent to null needles, and set det."""
"roger. now, that - the burn attitude will be coming up on a pad, but, basically, we're looking for a local horizontal retrograde burn, which means, using a coas, if you put the horizontal line on the coas on the horns of the earth and then roll to place the x-axis in the direction of the sun, we'll - that will put us in both burn attitude; and you can check that via the sun which will be in the aot detent 2. should lie right tape 68/'( along the cursor at the top. we'll have some more words orlvna_ lu_ you mum_u_j ..... , i'd _ke to go on to page 31 if you're ready. over. oh 04 27 01 cdr okay. i figure i have a handle on the attitude, the way the earth should look in the coas, and you're going to give me some words on what the sun would look like in the aot. is that right? 04 0h 27 14 cc that's affirmative, jim. we haven't got a pic- ture of it yet. it's going to be in the top part of the coas - correction, top part of the aot at the top of the - the top of detent 2 and the top part of the aot, and it should, in atti- tude, if you're right on the sun, should split the cursor, though that roll angle is not too crft_cal; if we're in about 10 degrees, we'll be okay. we - but i think - we think you should be able to get it better than that. on page 31, under the ""i)psburn technique,"" you can scratch the bottom part below the little diagram there since the gimbal is locked. over."
understand scratch the bottom part underneath the diagram because the gimbal is locked.
"that's affirmative; and, since the gimbal was trimmed out at the big burn yesterday, we should be still through the c.g., and we'd like to make sure that jack sits in the same place for this burn that he did yesterday. that way, we'll - you should have no trouble controlling attitude. now i'm ready to go over to page 32. over."
"okay. let me see if i have that right, now. you want jack to sit in the same attitude so that the gimbals are the same place so you don't have trouble controlling attitude. i got it."
"okay. now on page 32, top of the page, first line, scratch ""verb 76."" third line, ""mode control: ags, att hold."" at ""minus 6 minutes,"" scratch lines 1, 2, and at ""burn attitude,"" scratch ""verb 40 noun 20."" scratch lines 2, 3, and 4. now at ""burn attitude,"" we want you to do a ""400 plus 5"" and then a ""verb - a 400 plus zero."" and we have a caution note at this point. over."

"okay. after the last ""400 plus zero,"" ""do not go out of detent with aca."" is that correct?"
"that's a roger, jim. what happens is, of course, we set - when you go out of detent, you reset the ags error needles and you - and you lose your attitude reference. you establish a new attitude reference, and it might not be the burn attitude since, at this point, wa 're controlling attitude with the ttca. now, picking up with the ""verb 37, enter,"" scratch. scratch everything down to the ""404 plus zero,"" m_d we want you to perform those ags steps with 404 down through 470. over."
"okay. we '11 scratch everything down to ""h04 plus zero,"" and we'll perform those four steps."
"roger. turning over to page 33. minus 4 minutes. okay. moving down the page, it's about line 7, to ""engine gimbal"": ""engine gimbal, off."" down to ""mode control,"" make that read ""mode comhol: ags, att hold,"" and then scratch ""propellant quantity monitor, descent 1."" over. 0_ 04 32 16 cdr okay. at 4 minutes, ""engine gimbal"" will be ""off""; ""mode control"" will be to ""ags, att hold""; ""pro- pellant quantity monitor, descent 1,"" scratched."

"okay, ""the shutdown is on burn time minus i sec- ond.'' let me give you an example. if we have a 30-second burn, we're going to shut down at 29 seconds. is that correct?"
"tha,'_ affirmative. we'll give you the pad, be coming up here from fido in a couple of hours, i guess, when we stabilize out on our tracking. the reason for - if you're ready to copy out a couple of more steps, and then i '11 explain the reason we want to shut down on this burn time minus 1 second. picking up on ""when delta-v x - -"

"""0.1 foot per second."" the reason we are shutting down on the burn time is, since the asa breaker has been out for so long, we're not real confi- dent that our ags pipas are going to be super-sharp. so we wa!itto make sure that we just get a burn time - i_ooverburn; so we're, .shutting dowel on burn tsmt?minus 1 second. and then that will allow us a plus-x translation to trim _,70if it looks okay. if we had an overburn, we'd be in - -"

"roger. now, at the bottom of that page, i have a procedure for you to reestablish ptc. over."
to reestablish ptc. go ahead.

"okay. and step 8 is power down per contingency checklist power 5,"" and i take it that's been revamped considering our situation. okay."
"that's affirmative, jim. that's the one we gave you last night after the big burn, and we'll use that one as modified by - by us. this - we tried this ptc under ags in the simulator and, of course, no slosh or amything, but it seemed to work pretty good by hulling the rates using the ttca in pitch a_ldroll and letting the acs do it in yaw. you null the rates by looking at the error needles and just watching those, and when they don't - when they stop moving, then you got it within the limits of what we want. over. oh 04 45 40 cd_ okay. a_d i gues_j, charl_e, you have no - do you have a att hold mode in pitch and roll at all in this configuration we're in, or do we have to use the ttca?"
we feel like we have to use the ttca. the ags gains are not too good in pitch and roll in this configuration. it'll hold it in yaw but it won't in pit_ a_d roll. over.
okay.
"and you'll have - during the burn, of course, you'll be controlling pitch and roll via the error needles with the ttca also, and it's the little scheme that we've practiced in some of the sims. over. 04 o_ 4_5o_t cdr right. understand."
"and, houston, want to make sure that we allow enough timc to get to the proper attitude for the burn so that we can be sure we establish the proper attitude and don't have to rush the burn. 04 oh 46 51 cc roger, jim. we -we're looking right now, tentatively, at starting this about 45 minutes before the burn and our sensitivity is - not too bad on this burn. we can go 30 minutes either way and not affect our delta-v. over."
"okay. fine. and do you have a handle on just how long the burn will be? in time? o& 04 47 17 cc it's looking like at about 7.8 seconds and about 15 - correction, 7.8 feet per second and about 15 seconds. over."
in about 18 seconds?
negative. 15. 1 5.
1 5. okay.
and one other point is that we'd like to remind you that this is going to be in blowdown and both regs b closed but we've got plenty at the 10 percent.
"understand. oh oh 1_757 c( and, jim, in the simulator with our configuration that w_,had herc_, the th:lng i'._ real stable at l0 perc_'nt, _;owc don't think you'll have to tweak vcr'ymuch at all using tilettcas. over."
okay. understand.
and i'11 give you back to vance. thank you.
and thank you.
"aquarius, ttouston."
"go ahead, houston. oh 04 50 15 cc jim, regarding your number 2 battery, we think that it's probably a sensor failure, a temperature sensor failure that's caused this alarm, rather than an actual overtemp of the battery; the rea- son being that we haven't seen any higher temper- atures in the glycol loop. we expect to put the battery back on about 101 hours. that'll be about 10 minutes, and then we'll look at it some more there. over."
"okay. concerning number 2 battery, you think it might be a sensor failure because you haven't seen any changes, and you're going to put the battery back on the line in about 10 minutes."
that's affirm.
okay.
"hozuston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim."
"for information, vance, about a half hour ago, i guess, jack and i couldn't see constellations at certain spacecraft attitudes, stars. we could see the - scorpio and sagittarius and we could see altair or acrux and alpha centuri, vega, stars of that magnitude, and our venting has stopped which allows us now to differentiate be- tween the particles and the stars."
"roger_ copy. understand you can see the stars pretty well. were you, at that time, in an attitude facing away from the sun? i presume this is very attitude critical."
"yes. it is somewhat, v_mnce. if we have the suni sh:ln_ng ofl'th_ quads, it sort of ruins our vis- ion; and al.:o, if the earth or the moon are _n the genera field of view, we can't see anything."
okay. thank you.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, vance."
"jim, we're ready to put that battery back on the line. request you open the cross tie bal load circuit breaker, panel 16, and then put back - bat 2 back on the line."
"okay. first of all, we'll open the balance cross tie breaker on panel 16."
that's affirm.
"okay. the cross tie balance load circuit breakers is in now, vance. now you want us to put bat- tery 2 back on. is that affirm?"
"did you say it was in, or did you pull it out?"
no. it's in; do you wsmt it out?
"that's affirm. we'd like it out, and then bat 2 on the line."
okay. coming up. bat 2 is on the line. we have a master alarm and a battery light.
"copy. and - and we think that's probably an in- dication of the sensor problem, but stand by."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead_ houston.
"jim, it looks to us like your battery is good, that this is in fact a sensor problem; therefore, request you close the cross tie bal loads on - circuit breaker on panel 16. advise - -"
okay.
"- - advise that you will not have anm malfunction indication on any of your batteries now, but we can watch it from the ground. over."
okay. we'll close the cross tie balance load circuit brea_er at this time.
roger. copy.
"that's closed, and we don't have any warning on any of the batteries, but you can monitor from the ground."
"that's a,ffirm."
"and, jim, we have a lengthy procedure here for powering up the csm and turning on instrumentation so we can check the tm, and this will take a large piece of scratch paper whenever you're ready to copy."
this is to power up the csm? ob 05 06 24 cc that's affirm.
"okay. i'll tell you what, i'll have jack get configured. iiecan copy that down a_ldi'll have him - we'll get the stuff. stand by."
okay.
"okay, vance, how do you read the aquarius?"
"okay, read you loud and clear, aquarius. is it cool in there now?"
"okay. yes, it's pretty cool. this is the third officer on this lm crew here. ready to copy."
"oksy. jack, this is a lengthy procedure, take probably two or three pages. it assumes that you are in your nominal configuration_ which was sent up - or in your day-flying configuration, which was sent up to you earlier today."
"okay. i can verify that we are in that config- uration with the exception of panel 382, the water accumulator, which i've left off in case we wanted to get some more drinking water out of the command module, and i'll put those in the proper configuration before we do anything."
okay. ready to copy?

"okay. now - that was correct but i want to re- check the very first one, that was bat charlie voltage. is that what you read back?"
"okay. ()kay, flatcharlie voltage. seems like we're having a difference - i can't understand bat charlie from bat dog."
"okay. now, that - that complete procedure for getting into it, as far as getting into it's concerned. what i will give you now is how to back out of it after you're through with your readings. are you ready to copy?"
okay.
"okay. now you'l back out fairly quickly after you go into this proeeffure. ail we'll need is about 5 minutes of tm, and so if you're ready to copy, here it comes."
go ahead.
"panel 3: powe_ ampl to o_'_'. incidentally, copy this down on a piece of scratch paper as i read it, and then later i'll refer back to your first list where you can write things in the right- hand margin."
okay.

"okay, jack. what i just gave you now on the backout is the only thing that's order critical. from here on, you can go to the steps for ini- tiating the procedure, and backtrack. in other words, you should go to each of the panels that i read up and put the circuit breakers back to the base-line configuration - or the switches. over. 'l:al_6e8/20 04 05 2ti56 cmp okay, now here's - to accent, here's the sequence-critical sets: power amfl, o_,'_; transponder· off; ac inverter, 2, off; and the last one on panel 250, cb bat baker power entry/ postlanding, open; and then hit the steps in reverse order that you gave them to me, and back out, like then i would start on mdc 3 up telemetry, off - to off; and then ac inverter - ac1 bus 1 to off; and then ac inverter, 2, off; ac inverter, 2, main b to off. is that the type of order that you want to back out of?"
"that's affirm, but - just for kicks, let's go through these panels again, and i'll give you the - the position, just to make sure _here can be no doubt."
"okay. c_ ahead. 0h 05 30 20 cc okay. and once ag_ain in the - in the area where t said order was not critical, it's still not critical when you back out. but now i'll go ahead. okay, panel h: telcomm, group 1, ac1, it will not be ac1, it'll go to off. panel 5: all circuit breakers on that panel which were positioned will now come to opened. over."
"okay. panel 4: telcomm, group 1 will go off. panel 5: all the circuit breakers that we closed will go back to open."

"no. no, this is independent of power from the i_. %'his is a - this is purely a csm - -"
okay.
this is purely a csm powerup so we can take a look at your telemetry and see how cold the ve- hicle is amd that sort of thing.
okay. it's going in work.
"okay, now i won't - i won't have any voice with you, so - is that right? you don't want me to get connected up - you want me to just take these readings and come back and tell you what i have, huh?"
that's affirm. there'll be no voice. and - -

"okay, houston; aquarius. switching watches, and jack's going up into the command module."
"okay, jim. we have four steps here to give you to request that you get back on down voice backup, if you're ready to copy?"
ready to copy.
"okay. bit rate to lo bit rate. voice, _i_nction switch to down voice backifp. power amps cb, open; range function switch in ranging; that's verify."

okay. thank you.
"and, you want that in work, now?"
"that's affirm,"
okay.
"okay. houston, aquarius. how do you read?"
"loud and clear, jim."
"okay. i have a question for you, houston, if you have time,"
"sure, go ahead."
"and i'm copying down the reestablishing - ptc maneuver that charlie gave me. step 5 was, ""when rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, attitude control yaw to pulse."" and just how am i to get my rates down to 0.05 de- grees per second. my - my rate indicator, at the best, is 0.1 of a degree."
stand by.
"aquarius, tlouston."
go ahead.
"jim, this has been tried in the simulator by charlie and others, and what they recommend is that you null your rates on the error needles until you see no movement whatsoever, and then wait another couple of minutes, and that should do it. that's the only way we can tell. over."
okay. i'll give it the old college try.
"okay. and if you ean'_ attain that, why, of course, just the best you can do. we'll have to give it a try. maybe it won't be quite like the simulator."
right.
"okay, houston; aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay, vance. i've gone all the way through your procedure - all the way down to ""select best omnis,"" but i'm not getting any main bus b voltage and this i don't understand."
roger.
i can read - i can read bat - bat bus b voltage at 36.5 ....
"okay, jack. do you read now?"
"i am not sure, vance."
"okay. you faded out due to noise in the orien- tation. if you close the power amp circuit breaker, we can hear you better. over."
that's panel 16.
okay.
"okay. you faded out at the very beginning, so please go through that again. we understand you don't get anything on main b. l'al_(_' 507"
"okay, vance. how are you reading now?"
okay. we're hearing you better. stand by 1.
"okay, jack. please, repeat back now your conversation. you were cut out for - a while ago."
"i don't have any idea where we cut out, vance. i just said that we performed the procedure exactly as you say. we're down into the sep critical portion to where i said, ""select best omni."" however, we're not getting any main bus b voltage reading. i can read bat bus b, baker, at 36.5; bat charlie at 37.0, but i have negative main bus b readings."
"okay. stand by. 0)405 53 24 cc okay, jack. there are two - there's a switch and a circuit breaker that were positioned this morning that we'd i_e to have you check - correction, just the switch. panel 5, check your bus tie. main bus tie bat b/c on."
that is verified on. i checked that.
okay.
"okay, jack; this is houston. over."
"go ahead, vance."
"okay. we're getting data from you, jack, so that much looks good. on panel 5, request verification that eps sensor signal circuit breaker is main b. over."
okay.
or it's - -
- - stand by. - -
- - that main b is closed.
okay.
"okay, jack. and, we see your main bus b voltage at 28-1/2. 01405 56 17 cmp okay. you can see it. good. okay then. okay, vance. that circuit breaker is in. oh 05 56 28 cc copy."
"well, vance, if you're getting data from them, let me go back up there and finish the ..."
"okay, jack. please repeat, you're cutting out."
"okay, vance. okay. we just changed omnis here. i say, if you're getting data from us, that's the important thing. let me go back up into the bedroom there and get the readings you wanted, so we can get this stuff powered down. is that okay?"
"okay, we'll get - -"
- - by all means and - -
- - down there - -
- - select best omni - -
- - and then go back up.
"okay, vance. we'll go back up - we've got voltage now, and we'll go back up and take the readings that you want."
okay. and select best omni.
"okay. i'm going back up into the bedroom, vance. how do you read?"
loud and clear.
okay. i'm going back up to the bedroom. we'll select best 0mni and continue on with the pro- cedure.
roger.
"okay, vance. jim's up. how do you read?"
"reading you loud and clear, jim."
okay.
"and, houston, i noticed through the aot and l'a_c 509 through the overhead docking window that we are venting again."
"okay, jim. understand; the service module is venting."
that's affirm.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, would you holler into the bedroom and tell jack that when he has his onboard readouts that we wish he'd back - use the backout procedure and shut down again - per the procedure we gave him."
roger. as soon as he - as soon as he gets his onboard readouts to use the powerdown procedure and shut down. is that right?
that's affirm.
"okay. jack just - jack just told me that he's through, and he's going to go through the back- out procedures again, the first one he's got is the shutdown."
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
jack's ready to give you the readings if you are ready to copy them.
stand by.
okay. go ahead.
"okay, vance. the readings that you wanted; are you ready?"
"ready to copy, jack. 04 06 09 01 cml bat charlie, 37.0; pyro a, 37.0; pyro b, 37.0; sp$ helium pressure, 3450; and just for kicks, nitrogen a, 2300; nitrogen b, 2400; cm rcs injector temperatures: 5 charlie, 4.5; 5 dog, 3.5; 6 all'a,4.0; 6 baker, 4.6; 6 charlie_ 4.0; 6 dog, b.8; battery manifold pressure, 4 alfa, 1.4."
"okay, jack, we got it. thank you very much."
okay. how does the telemetry look on our - on the old odyssey?
it doesn't look too cold. looks pretty good.
okay. thank you very much.
you bet.
we're going to need him.
"row does it feel, jack?"
"i'll tell you, deke, it's cold up in there. i don't know whether we'll be able to sleep up there tonight; it must be about 35 or ho degrees."
"roger. that's just what i was worrying about. 04 06 10 59 cmio right now, we're getting two sets of cwgs on."
"it's not uncomfortable at all in aquarius, but it definitely is cold in odyssey."
roger.
"okay, vance. jim's back on."
"go ahead, jim."
we just had a change in watch; that's all. 04 06 i1 57 cc okay.
"aquarius, houston, over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, two items: in the command module, we wish to verify that the pyro battery selector was left in the main position. and we're ready to have the power amp circuit breaker on panel 16 pulled, whenever you are ready. tat'(_ 69/7"
"okay, vance. fred just tells me that he put it there, and we're checking that again about the pyro battery selector in the main position."
okay. understand that you are checking it.
and i will pull the power amp circuit breaker.
roger.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim."
how does number 2 battery look to you now?
stand by.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"jim, it looks like it was probably a sensor problem; the battery number 2 is load-sharing well. and we see no indications of higher temperatures in the glycol loop or anything that would make us think that it is heating up."
okay. thank you.
roger.
"houston, aquarius."
roger. go ahead.
"i just want to talk over a little philosophy here. fred told me that at one time you came up and told him that we were a little steep on the entry angle, and now our burn is going to make us - give us a steeper angle. i just want to make sure that we're all talking about the same thing_ that, in essence, at this particular situation, we're shallow s are not steep, and we are going to in- crease the angle."
"jim, the situation is that, at the moment, we're a little bit shallow, and retrograde midcourse is going to put us more in the center of the corridor. over. 04 06 5;' 27 cdh okay; fir_e. i just, wanted to make .m_re. fred had writ, l,_rl d_wrl_ r;ome time _,/_, t,hat- l,hat our _mgle now war; about 71 and we were going to do a midcourse of 7 feet per second because ire appears that we're going to shallow it out. i think we're all talking the same language now."
"roger. and, i guess it follows, but your perigee is a little bit high right now, too; so that will be bringing it back - back down, that is. ()ii06 52 d7 cdr yes. yes, that's the important thing."
"one other question, jim. our readings down here say your lm cabin's about as cold as the command module cabin. is that right?"
"well, we really don't know. there's usually two people in the lm cabin, and it's a lot - it seems to be a lot more compact, and so we don't notice the coldness down here as we do in the command module."
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
go ahead.
"some time ago, i copied down a long comm midcourse-7 corridor control burn at a get of 134:59:42.98. is that burn pad still valid?"
"jim, that's affirm. that pad is still valid."
and that is assuming no midcourse 7 here at 105 hours.
that's affirm.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"jim, we're setting up your burn for 105:30, and we'll be working up a pad, et cetera, based on that time. over."
roger. the time will 105:30.
"and, additional point; i guess this one's for jack. do we have any idea why we couldn't read the main bus b voltage a while back when fir'_;t he didn't get it and then later he did?"
yes. i think we have a reason for that. stai_d by.
"it appears, vance, that the battery charge circuit breaker which appeared to be in, wasn't in. fred pulled it and reset it, and then he started get- ting readings."
roger. which circuit breaker was that?
"it was - it was the battery charge circuit breaker that allows you to read volts, but we haven't - don't know the exact name for it yet."
okay. understand. 04 06 59 _8 cdr the name is battery charger bat b charge jack tells me.
okay. battery charger bat b charge.
"aquarius, houston. 04 07 go 25 cdr go ahead."
have you opened your - just curiosity - have you opened your food locker just aft of the lm data file? over.
yes. it's been opened.
okay. just checking. thanks.
... meal had come through.
good.
it came at the right time.
good.
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"jim, we have some csm temperatures here for you that might be of interest, if you're ready to copy. l_._e 514"
roger. go ahead.
"okay. your quad package temperatures range from 85 degrees to 44 degrees. your cm rcs injectors range from 44 degrees to 21; and your heat shield is well above its lower limits in all the various locations. temperatures appear to be cycling based on sun angle, and it's no sweat. _aey all look very good."
sounds good. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice tii_jscription panic 515
"were you calling, houston?"
"negative, jim."
okay.
"and, houston, how do you read aquarius?"
"read you loud and clear, fred. how do you read?"
okay ....
roger. we were just about to send you up some items of information pertaining to the burn. are you ready to copy? 01407 43 13 lmp stand by.
okay.
"okay. go ahead, vance."
"okay, fred. first of all, preparations for this, starting with contingeacy checklist, page 24, we would recommend should start at 104:30 get, and we'll be happy to receive any comments you have on that, though. second point: when you're in the burn attitude, you should see the sun at the very top of the aot. it'll be splitting the cursor, when your cursor's set at zero. one thing to be aware of though, that it'll slip right out of the aot very easily since it'll be very sensitive to roll and yaw. understand that's in detent 2, by the way. next point: the burn is very insensi- tive to burn time and attitude. in other words, if necessary, we can slip it if there's any problem at all, and attitude isn't too critical. so that brings us to the point that we only have one real burn rule; that is, if - rate about any axis gets to 10 degrees a second, that's the limit to stop the burn. next point, after you finish the burn, and before you trim, request that you leave deda in address 470 up a while so we can take a look at it, and let us holler when we've seen it, and then proceed on. over."
"okay, vance. you're saying we should start into the prep in the contingency book at about 104:30, and i'll talk this over in a minute with jim and we'll get back with you on it. when in the burn i':w,/_ '_(, attitude, we should see the sun right at the top of the aot, and i assume this is detent number 2. jim and i'd already been talking about that, and just eyeballing the terminator in the earth, we figured the sun at about something like a 70-degree angle - 65-degree angle, so that'll be right up there. we get one burn rule that says if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per second, shut her down. and, after we trim, you want me to leave 470 up for a while so you a2l can have a look at it, and you'll tell me when to get rid of it."
"that's right, fred. and, if you have any ques- tions at all regarding the alinement, why please let us know. wc'll be happy to answer them, like alining on the earth, as was described before. also, you should know that the pitch is the most critical attitude so far as errors are concerned in this burn; but, as i said, it's still not very sensitive."
"yes, the- and unfortunately, the way we're looking out the window through the coas, we can aline the yaw and roll pretty well, but it's the - sun that has to get us pitch."
right. and - and a correction on this deda 470 thing. request that we let you - give you a go before you trim. over.
"say - say again, vance, on that last."
"roger. we would like to see address 470, and give you a go before you trim. over."
"oh, okay. i - i see. okay. after burn, we'll leave 470 up a while and wait for your word to do the trim."
that's correct. how was the sleep?
okay. and -
"okay. vance, are you there? oh 07 50 17 cc roger. go ahead. oh 07 50 21 lmp okay. the picture that jim gave me on his view through the coas was within the - the partial earth, the lit portion laying in the top half of the coas with the cusp laying right on the y-y line. and so the - the whole dark part of the earth would be at the bottom part of the earth, except a very thin crescent of the dark part to a line - line above the y-y line."
"okay. that is correct. oh 07 51 00 lmp and that in essence - that in - yes, that in essence would put our x-axis pointing toward the sun."
that's correct. the plus x-axis pointing toward the sun and perpendicular to the terminator of the earth.
okay.
"two other points, fred. one is that we don't expect hardly any misalinement of your engine for the burn, so we don't really expect any rates throughout the length of the burn, especially since it's at very ow thrust. second point, request you verify that your suit temperature rheostat's in full cold. that - if it - if it were in full cold, that might help your cabin temperature situation. it might bring the temperature up."
okay.
okay. the latter was a good point. we had it in full hot.
very good.
"and roger on the - roger on the rates, too."
okay.
"okay, vance. is the t. time going to be ig approximately - is it 105 or 105:307"
it's 105:30.
"okay. your 104:30 time to start in is - sounds pretty good. that'll give us lots of time to get set up with the attitude business, in case we have any trouble stopping ptc and getting there and - that will give us a little time to be sitting and waiting, all set up."
"okay, fred. wood."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"are you calling, vance?"
"right, fred. we just noticed a 2-pound drop in your water quantity. have you guys had a drink recently or do you know any reason why it might have dropped? over."
negative.
thank you.
"aquarius, houston."
"all right. go ahead, vance."
"fred, that may be a funny in the data. the rate's gone back to normal; and we'll keep an eye on it, but we don't think you should worry about it too much."
let's hope not.
"and, houston, aquarius. 04 08 9 07 cc go ahead, aquarius. ()ii08 19 ;12 lmp are we going to get any sort of a pad on this? (11_08 i1!_20 cc that's affirm, fred. estimating we'll have it to you in about 15 minutes. 04 08 j9 28 lmp okay."
"and, houston, you might just let us know if there's any chance it's going to sl_p further down the road, because we're going to kind of hod to that 104:30 start time. and if you're going to delay any, we'll delay accordingly. ()il08 20 03 cc roger. we won't have any trouhle making that_ fred, i'm told. 04 08 20 2 i,m_ okay."
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius. paf_e 519 ()it08 31 12 cdr roger. we have about 104 dul_rees now. how does that ...?"
okay. fido's hustling here. we'll try to get it right up to you. stand by.

"aquarius, houston. over."
we have ...
"aquarius, houston. over."
"vance, we have the quad heaters on, now."
"roger. copy, jim. a_ldthe - jack's going to read you the pad right now, so i recommend you go ahead and get started. you shouldn't be delayed by the pad at all. u_ uu 7 _ cc uarius, _u_uuu. i w _uu ju_z u_z,,pad."
"roger, houston. stand by. are you ready - stand by to copy. okay. ready to copy."
"okay. a p30 maneuver pad on the dps: purpose is midcourse 5, noun 33, 105:30:00.00, noun 81 is n/a, ha is n/a, perigee, plus 0019.8, 0.007.8, 0.15, the rest is n/a. shut down the engine at 1 second prior to the end of burn time. shut down at 14 seconds manually. ullage is four jets for 10 seconds, 10-percent throttle. go ahead."
"okay, jack. we've got a dps midcourse 5: noun 33, 105:30:00.00; noun 81, n/a; ha n/a; plus 0019.8_ 0007.8, burn time 0.15, the rest of the pad, n/a. shut down manually at 14 seconds, ullage four jets for lo seconds, and the entire burn is at 10-percent throttle."

okay. good readback. you got it. pa_e 520
"aquarius, louston, i haw_ some additional entry data that goes with the pad i just read up. it's five items. let me know when you're rea_ r to copy. it's on a maneuver pad."
"okay. i'll try to squeeze them in there, jack. i'm rapidly running out of pads."
go ahead.
okay. it's n/a all the way down to noun 61. your latitude is minus 21 - -
"hold on a minute; hold on. you need the - hold on, jack, i need the other pad book, that csm pad."
that's affirm.
okay. now i'm ready.
"okay. noun 61: latitude, minus 21.67, minus 165.37, 1163.1, 36292, 142:41.02. read back."
"okay. noun 61; minus 21.67, minus 165.37. 1163.1, 36292, 142:41.02."
good readback.
"and you should have high bit rate now, jack."
"okay, fred. we're getting it now. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"houston, aquarius. 04 08 46 _4 cc go ahead, aquarius."
did you have readouts on our quad temps _.oknow when we can start? we're taking a time hack. we'd just like a verification with you.
roger. your quad temps look good from here.
"okay, houston; aquarius. we're going to stop ptc at this time."
"roger, aquarius. go _tead."
how about if you do - -
"say again, jack."
"negits on my last, fred. 04 08 53 12 _ okay, jack. how do you read now?"
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. i thought you called, jack. we're maneuvering around here to fish for the earth."
"and, houston, aquarius. how's the asa package temp look now?"
"okay, fred. the asa package temp is looking good. it's around 98 degrees, and we'd like to see it go up about 15 to 20 degrees."
okay. why don't you give me the word before i proceed with the ags. we really don't need it right this instant.
roger. we'll be watching it.
"aquarius, houston. the asa package temp is up now so you can activate the ags."
okay. very good.
"okay, jack. so we can make sure and get our timer set here, i wondered when your - you've _'_l"":_2,_ got about 48 minutes to the burn which should be coming up pretty quick - you'd give us a hack so we could set our event timer at 12."
"roger, fred. i understand you want a mack at 17 m_m_tes _rior to the burn. is that affirm?"
"roger. we think we got it set now. we just wanted to check it. if we don't, then i'll set it to 13, and you can _ive me another hack at 47 to go."
okay. we got 33 to go.
mark.
my mistake. it was 33 - -
right on.
roger. it was reading 33 on my mark. right?
okay. you got about 105:03 get now down there?
"that's affirmative, fred. going through 105:03:45."
mark.
okay.
"okay, jack. give me the next number you want me to set then, and i'll take another hack here."
"roger. you're counting up, right?"
roger.
"okay, fred. on my mazk, be 35 minutes to the burn."
standing by.
"we missed her, fred. let's get it on the next minute. 04 09 05 17 _ okay."
"okay, aquarius. on my mark, it's going to be 34 minutes to the burn, and youtll be reading 36. stand by."
mark.
okay. we got it cranked up.
"okay, houston. we have our attitude set."
"roger, jim."
i hope the guys in the back room who thought this up right knew what they were saying.
"and i'm looking through the aot there, jack, and the sun's right in the top and it's about maybe 2 degrees to the right of the cursor. so that looks real good."
roger. good going.
"okay, aquarius. the attitude looks good here and your choice when you want to start the burn."
"we're counting down, arentt we, or do you want us to start any time?"
your choice.
you guys are getting easy.
"itts not time critical, jim."
"i understand. 04 09 15 59 _ and, houston, we reset our clock and we're making the burn in about - i'll give you a hack here at 2 minutes to go."
"roger, fred. and let us know when you're going to ullage, will you? 04 09 16 16 _ okay. 04 09 16 25 _ okay. stand by. 2, _."
"mark it. 04 09 16 29 _ three minutes to go. correction, 2 minutes to go, jack."
roger. two minutes. we got it. 'l'a_o71/4 i'a_ 5;'4
"aquarius, houston. check engine gi_al off, please."
it's verified to off. and - 04 09 17 28 imp mare it. 04 09 17 29 iaip one minute.
"roger, fred."
engine arm to descent.
ullage.
okay. you're looking at 470.
roger. we copy 7.4.
"roger. 7.4 and i had about 0.2 showing, i guess, when we started."
"roger. we verify that, okay, aquarius. trim it to 7.6."
okay. you want plus-x now to get 7.6. is that correct?
that's affirmative.
"okay. you're looking at it, houston."
okay. looks good. nice work.
let's hope it was.
"okay, aquarius. wetre ready to follow you through on setting up ?tc and powerdown. your choice."
okay. we're pressing into getting ptc established right now.
"aquarius, houston. wetd like to change the num- ber of yaw pulses we gave you before as 21. we'd like to reduce that to 12. twelve pulses yaw right, and that'll take you about 3 seconds to get them in if you don't want to count them."
okay. we'll make it 12 versus 21.
"okay, houston. i'm just about there now and as soon as i get 90, we'll start damping rates. 01409 29 57 cc roger, aquarius."
"okay, houston. i'm trying to damp rates now. we're at the proper roll attitude and pitch."
"roger, aquarius."
working a little bit better this time.
"are you copying any attitudes down there, rates, et cetera?"
"okay, aquarius. we're seeing some extremely low rates at this time, really below our capability to measure them."
roger.
"houston, i think itve got pitch and roll just about squared away. i let yaw just slightly drift; it's drifting in a clockwise direction and i'm about all set mow to put in my 12 clicks to the right."
"roger, jim. ready to look at it with you."
twelve clicks right.
"okay, jack. are we clear now to proceed with the powerdown?"
"that's affirmative, fred. we're ready to press on with powerdown. i've got two changes for you. step 1 of the emergency powerdown on page power - 5. over."
go ahead.
"okay. leave your powf_jamplifier switch in primary vice off and put your ranging switch to range, vice off/reset."
okay. we're in prim in the power amp and ranging on ranging.
affirmative. ·_ 71/6
"okay. i'm going to pull. well, here, let's just look at the checklist. 04 09 39 14 lm_ okay. configure cbs. there you go."
"aquarius, houston, hold off 1 on po_erdow_, please. 04 09 39 23 _ okay. we'll hold off. and wetre looking at a she pressure, incidentally, of about 1830 now."
roger. we concur with that. and it looks like you got a little pitch rate going on here. do you copy the same?
"okay. my pitch needle is just slightly up now. i could try to take it out if you want me to. 04 09 39 58 _ not - wait, wait. there you go."
"just hold off on it 1, jim. we'd like to take a look at it."
okay.
"aquarius, we'll need high bit rate, please."
"flashlight, jack. jack, flashlight over here a minut e."
"aquarius, we need the power amplifier back in high bit rate, please. g4 09 40 37 imp you got it."
you got a couple in the roll pretty soon.
"what is it, 1.77"
you have another set of them by the pgns.
now we got to turn on the heaters you want to save -
"what's that flitting out there in the breeze? are we venting again? take a look, jack."
"well, once we get squared away, joe, i think i am going to have to go to the space center and take a good healthy one and leave just about everything. i've held up long enough. 04 09 42 32 iaip that's coming from above. another one just - is just coming down right over here. well, there's the old terminator at fra mauro. we'd been landing about 2 hours ago, huh? right on the - -"
"houston, aquarius."
- - to the right of the terminator.
"go ahead, aquarius."
"just for information, although i thought i'd never have to use it, that technique looked like it was a pretty good one."
"roger, jim. and we'd like you to give us your idea of how the ptc looks. we're not s_re we're seeing what we ought to here."
okay.  still have my ball powered up and i'm coming around past 270 right now. i've got a slight roll and pitch offset in there. my pitch needle about halfway up and my roll needle is about 4 degrees over now.
"okay, jim. with that info we'll go on the ptc, and let's proceed with the powerdown."
okay. we'll proceed with the ptc and proceed with the powerdown. i guess if we have to we can reestablish ptc at a later date. okay. okay.
first row. ullage. ags.
your ags on?
"my what? my what? oh, yes. go ahead."
"okay. the four inverters of this ac bus volt, fred."
okay. go ahead.
okay. let's - give the last thing to jack and i'll keep it all out. okay? rcs system a. that's in. tcas are going off. why do they need the isol valves ia the ascent feed in?
"youtre not sucking any power unless you take these switches and move them. 'l'a_e '(l/8 pa,,_u '.)db"
"how come we pulled them out, then, in this burn?"
"because you didn't want them to get moved inadvertently, i guess. it doesn't matter, jim, they can be out or in in terms of powerdown. they just don't count."
"okay. i got 1, 2, 3."
isol valve should be in 2.
"yes. okay. third row. attitude direct control i still have in. 04 09 46 41 i24p jack, how do you read now in baseband?"
"reading you 5-square, fred. how me? 04 09 _6 48 lmp okay. i'll stay this mode, if it's all right, so we won't be hot miksd."
roger.
"aquarius, houston. you're cleared to open the power amplifier circuit breaker and go to low bit rate, leaving the power amp switch in primary. 04 09 52 40 i_mp okay. i'll pull the prime s-band power amp breaker and go low bit rate. 04 10 04 25 limp houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius. 04 10 04 34 i2vfp about how far out are we now, jack?"
"okay, aquarius. youtre 150 000 miles and you're coming in at 4500 feet a second. that's from the earth. 04 10 05 01 ijfp okay. we're at 100 - yes. 150 k, 4500 feet a second."
"and, aquarius, how much ttca control did you have to do in the burn? 04 10 05 34 i24p how much - what was that, jack?"
"how much control of the ttca did you have to do during the burn? i_:j,./5_;()?"
 wasn't noticing jim too much. i'd say i put in maybe about six or seven inputs. i don't think it ever got off more than a couple of needle widths.
"roger, fred. thank you."
i think it's probably the same for jim. i wasn't noticing his input but the - his needle was hanging in there pretty good.
"roger. thank you, fred. _pollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcrii_tion ta_ _ 72/ 04 10 _3 40 cc aquarius, ttouston. how do you read? 04 10 33 245 cmp i read you loud and elear, jack."
"okay, jack. what's your status, who's sleeping, and who's working?"
"well, right now we're all three kind of working. do you have any recommendations? 04 10 3h 04 cc yes, looks like to us from here that you and fred ought to get some ._leep, and that you ought to eat in about 6 hours. and that the skipper ought to go to bed about 113 hours. oh 0 34 23 cmp okay. oh !0 3h p4 cc i've got some other information. we shouldn't have some good dope on your trajectory for about 2 hours. looked like to us that the burn was real good, however, and we're taking a close look at it, and we'll gc_.tback with you on that in about 2 hours from now. another thing that we're expecting to have happen is that the she tank is going to reach its burst limit. the earliest time we predict this will happen will be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes. and the latest probable time is at 110 hours, and this is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you might hear it and you might see something."
okay. that's good news. we were wondering about that. and i'll relay all the other information you gave me.
"okay. and if the she tank does burst during this time frame before we get trajectory info, why, that will delay our tra_ectory info somewhat. your consumables, your rater is now good through 152 hours."
"jack, wait a minute. let me copy some of this down. oh 10 35 34 cc okay."
okay. i'm ready now. _a_e 531 04 0 35 54 cc okay. we're predicting that you still have more water than you need. and one thing we'd like for you to do is when you're going to sleep up there in the command module take a look through the optics and see if you can see any stars.
"okay, jack, i will do. jim and i were able to spot constellations from the windows of the lm when there's no venting taking place. could you give me some time on these consumables, what you're predicting they're good for? i think you started to give them times, didn't you, or was i just hearing things. 04 0 36 56 cc we started to give you some t_mes. we think we might be able to give you some better ones pretty soon. but it looks like your water is good through 15_ hours, and you've got takusan 02 through o7o _..... ____._ _ _,__ .......... and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199 or 200 hours. over."
okay; good. copy that.
"we expect that your water rate is going to drop off and at the time, delta will go up to 160 - 165 hours quite shortly. another thing we're interested in is what's your status on rest and medication."
"okay. none of us, i know of, had any medications, and right now as far as rest, i suppose we're no tireder than normally in this situation. i'm going to relay the work-sleep cycle."
okay. and don't forget to look through the optics when you go up in the command module.
"(laughter) okay. i'll do that. oh 10 40 04 cmp jack, as luck would have it, we just now started to vent a little from the command module ..."
"aquarius, houston. sorry about that but there's too much background noise to read you. i think we'll have to wait until you come up on a new antenna. over. pa_e 532"
"okay, aquarius. go ahead now. i think can hear you. 0_ 10 41 ob cmp okay. okay, jack. i was going to say, as luck would have it, the command module picked this time to start v_ting again, _o i probably won't be able to get a good hack out of stars out of the telescope."
"okay. thank you. and if you can think of it, when the time comes up, when you're not venting_ how about remembering to take a look through them and give us a word?"
okay. will do.
"houston, aquarius."
go ahead. over.
"aquarius, houston. did you call?"
"yes, jack. i just got _ question. how long are you predicting our command module canisters to last in here?"
"okay, jack. we've got 14 cartridges that'll last 157 hours, plus we've got the i_mprimary cartridge with 23 hours, and we've got two plss cartridges with 7 hours apiece."
okay. i was just curious as to how much time we've got out of these two cartridges.
"stand by 1. i'll get a prediction on that. by the way, i hope you're keeping track of the ones you've used and the ones you've not."
"yes, right now, we have numbers 7 and 8 in the i_mhere."
roger.
they were two brand new fresh ones.
"aquarius, ttouston. in regards to the c02 canisters, by the way the pco2 is reading 1.6 down here now. we expect that we can get 6 more hours out of the two canisters that we have there - 6 hours at least. however, at 112 hours, j 'pape 72/4 _ai_e533 when we've got several people up, we're going to rig up two more and we have the new simplified procedure for doing this. however, in the meantime, should we need to have a canister change, we plan to switch to the lm primary canister. over."
"okay. copy that, jack. 0h 10 51 08 cc and, aquarius, how's your ptc holding up?"
"well, we got a little bit off jack. the - it starts high in the lmp's window and goes low in the cdr window. oh 10 5 37 cmp so we've got a little b_t of a wobble on it. of course, the command nodule venting doesn't help, either."
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"jack, in reference to your question about the ptc, on this last complete revolution, the sun first appeared in the very top right corner of the lmp window, passed over the cdr window, and was visible through the overhead window, and now the moon is - came pretty well through the center of both windows this last time."
"okay. thank you, jack. copying that."
"aquarius, houston. we'd like to get a little better idea of how ptc is going. so, what we'd like for you to do is what we did last time. that is to give us a reading on the center of the earth and the center of the moon on the - lpd. oh 11 07 49 cmp on the lpd. okay, it's shifted. let's see, the moon's gone by and the earth didn't come into the lpd last time."
"okay. but when it goes by the plane of the lpd, tell us where it was. okay?"
"okay. will do. 04 11 13 3h cmp okay, jack. this pass, the earth came into view at the top left-hand corner of the lmp's window and was going down. however, when it passed it wasn't as high up as the last pass. it did pass into view at the cdr window, but too high up to get an lpd reading. 01411 13 57 cc roger. understand it went high in both windows then. 014 14 04 cmp yes, last time it wasn't even visible in the cdr's window; this time it was visibe if you squatted down, but too high up to _et an lpd reading. 04 1 ill i1_ cc ()kay, jack. that's _ood. thank you. _/$ ii _1 51 ('.mp .)kay, houston; aquar:ius. 04 i ?1 53 cc go ahead. over. oh 11 ?l q7 limp okay. the moon came into view at the mlddi!e __' t:helmp's window, passed through the cd_'s window at an lpd of 5 degrees. 014il _,_'_1 cc roger. understand. 0)l11 35 55 cmp houston, aquarius. 04 1 35 58 cc go ahead, aquarius."
"okay, jack. on this pass, the earth comte into the view at the top part of the inp's window, and we got an lpd angle on it as it passed through the cdr's window of a minus 4 degrees."
"okay. a minus 4. thank you, jack - -"
"it's - it's above the - okay. are you familiar with the minus 4 being halfway through the sky part, huh?"
affirmed.
"okay, houston; aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. on this pass, the moon came into view at the top part of the lmp's window, came across higher. jim estimates the lpd angle at a minus 15 degrees. 'i'a_e72/6 0_ 11 45 09 cc okay. a minus 15 on the moon, and sounds like it's set up pretty well."
everybody's happy with it down there?
"aquarius, it's a little too early to tell exactly how the ptc is going. we'd like to get a few more points, so keep reading them off, and we're still looking for that supercrit to go anytime."

"the moon passed by at a minus s degrees on the lpd. no, that's the earth. the earth passed by at a minus 8 degrees."
okay. the moon went by at a minus 8 degrees.
"okay, jim. we got it. the earth went by at a minus 8 degrees. on a basis of the data - -"
that's r_ght.
"on the basis of the data we have so far, your entry angle is 5.99. the block data we gave you on the pad for a no-comm midcourse-7 last night is no longer valid because we made this midcourse."
"okay. understand, the no-comm pad is no longer valid because of the mdcourse. entry angle based on the last 2 hours' tracking is 5.99, and i take it you're going to keep tracking for some time now to see whether we need another midcourse or not. tab' 7 _, ·"
that's affirmative.
"are you planning any no-com2_ midco ,rse at 13h and change anyway right now, or are you going to wait? like we're going to wait on the tracking. for the time being, since you're in the corridor, why, there's no need to pa$:_ _,up. blt we'r_ going to keep looking at the tracking, and we'll probably come up with one."

"aquarius, houston. ycu notice anything?"
"yes, jack. z was just about ready to call you. underneath quad 4, i noticed a lot of sparklies going out."
can you hear or feel aaything?
"no, i sure can't, but i think it changed our - it changed out ptc. let me check and see what the drift is."
okay. she's going down through 600 now. pa_e 533

"okay, jim. it's goin_ through 125 pounds now. and we tm3erstcoc a yon to say - - n), _o _v _n r,np okay"
- - that it reversed your yaw. is that affirma- tive?
"sure did, jack. it reversed my yaw completely and put in a little pitch, t think."
"but more than anything, it reversed my yaw."
roger. laveyou effecthvely established ptc in the opposite direction then?
"well, you could say that. i'm not too sure just what kind of pitch or roll i've got, coupled with the yaw. i just saw the earth go by the lmr's window here, not too long ago at a rather faster rate than we had going the other direction."
perhaps you can tell ?ow fast i'm having to shift omnis.
"yes, we can tell the comm cycling back and forth."
is that what they call a nonproputsive vent?
right. i'd hate to see a propulsive one.
"you and me both. 0ij2 59 04 cc it's going through 50 pounds now. f:o,are you seeing fewer sparklies?"
"yes. much fewer. not any at all, now. i'm not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what it gave me."
you say you think it might have given you some left roll as opposed to opposite yaw.
"i'm sure it gave me the yaw, jack, but i'm not too sure ..."
"okay. we'd kind of like to watch it_ sec what happens for a little while before we mete a recommendation. howe_er, we'll need some inputs from you on that."
"well, we're in no trouble up here as far as - it's faster than we hsd set up before. we just wanted to get into proper thermal constraint, and it's going to taka me 15 minutes to get the thrusters up anyway."
"okay, skipper. we don't see any thermal problems as a result of this change. if we see some communications problems, we may have to do something different, but so far, so good. and we'd kind of like to hear from you on lpd num- bers, if you get anything going by the window."
okay. will do.
"okay, jack. the earth just went through at an lpd of 26 degrees."
okay. the earth went through at 26 degrees going the opposite direction this time - left to right. is that right?
"from left to right. %hat's affirmative. ,; 04 13 02 32 cc of course, the only other thing that we'd be concerned about is what change in your velocity this might have had and what delta-v it imparted, and we'll have to look at that for a while before we are able to determine it. and, if there is no significant change, why, we prefer just to leave it the way it is."
"okay, jack. we'r_ going to get a time on a revolution here, and maybe that'll help you out."
"right. and, for your information, the tank went at 1937."
that's two thousand - 19377
right.
"okay, jack. the earth went through again at 18 degrees on the lpd."
okay. earth at 18. thank you. 01413 04 23 cmp okay. and we didn't see the moon that time.
"okay, jack. the moon _ent through that time at 32 degrees on the l_d."
roger. moon at 32. thanks.
"okay, jack. well, we didn't get the earth that time. the moon came back through at about 10 degrees, and now we're getting to the earth again. stand by."
"okay. the earth came through the lpd at 62 degrees that time. and the total time for the two revolutions, - i missed the earth revolution before, but the total time for the earth's two revolutions was 3 minutes and 50 seconds."
"say again the time and the - and also the lpd number. you're in the background noise, jack. 0)413 09 39 cmp okay. ok_, jack. lp9 that time was 62 degrees and that was for two revolutions, being at that distance we missed the earth - the time before we didn't see it. and the time was 3 minutes and 50 seconds."
"okay. three minutes and 50 seconds. is that rate uncomfortable for you? oh 13 10 34 cmp jack, jim said it isn't uncomfortable. it's a little annoying as for the 0mni switching, and also he said it's kind of - he said this earth/moon relationship's kind of ... because he doesn't know when to ..."
roger.
"okay, jack. we've got a master ala_ and we've got a battery light flickering."
okay. copy a battery light. what battery?
"aquarius, how about cycling the power temp monitor to find out which battery it is, please."
"yes. that's in work, joe."
"okay. it's that same old ... 04 1_ 14 54 c_ okay, fred. i can hear you now, say again, please."
"okay. yt's the same old - same old one. the only light i'm getting is on bat 2. u.__ 15 35 cc okay, fred. we copy your same old friend, battery 2. could you giye us high bit rate for a while, please?"
"aquarius, houston. high bit rate, please."
"how you getting it now, jack?"
we got it.
"okay, aquarius. you can go low bit rate, po_'_r amp, off and d0_ voice backup now. voltages and currents look normal on battery 2; so ignore the battery light."
"okay, jack. power amp, off, back to low bit rate, and i'll go back to sleep."
"the battery light staying on? 04 13 21 30 cml yes. we got a steady on bat 2, bat fault light and the battery caution light."
okay. and the skipper in the sack now? oh 13 21 56 cmp say again?

okay. it's not really much trouble. that's _ll we're doing about it. we'll try to keep up with it. and you're satisfied with this attitude so far. i guess you're going to watch the thermal and find out whether perhaps we're going to some other ptc attitude.
"roger. thermal appears to be no problem. we're looking at what delta-v might have been impa_ted due to this, and it looks like we're not going to change the ptc attitude."
"okay. then delta-v was a part of it; i hope it raised that angle a little bit. 04 13 25 h4 cc yes. we'll he looking at the data here, and give you a better answer in next 30 minutes or so."
"okay. meanwhile, back to the drawing board about nonpropulsive vents."
"and, with your kind of luck, it probably lowered the angle s_ne more."
thanks for the confidence.
"and, jim, we're going to have a handover here pretty soon, about 3 minutes, we may lose uplink for 30 seconds or a minute."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. we're handed over. how do you read?"
"read you loud and clear, jack."
"okay. i'm hearing you now, and the noise has come up again, but it will go down."
how do you read now?
"okay. that's a lot better, and we figure your battery glitch was just that thermal switch triggered a mal - a caution and warning, just cycled once, and triggered a master alarm again. we'll watch the batteries for you, since you don't have any caution and warning on now. tap e 74/_' 014 13 31 13 cdi/ okay. apprcciat(. tha!.."
"okay, jim. your luck is holding. tracking shows that your entry angle has gone up to minus 6.2)4. this is on the basis _f all the data we'e col- lected between the midcourse up to the time the she tank went. _;o,wc'l continue to la,ok at it, 'md see if slletank did :mylhng to it al, ail. so it's - thc data ha:; i_on' l':'om ',.o .o :t minus 6.24."

"hey, that sounds great."
that doesn't include ?lss water or command module water.
"okay. jack, i'd just like to know what - what plans or thoughts being contemplated for the plsss or the ops, whe;her we're going to use their lioh canisters or take the devices back in the command module wi:;hus, or just what will be your plans."

"jim, we've had a lot ,fpeople working on the entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to do so. we got a few ideas we'd like to toss at you so you can start _hinking about them if you think you're in a position to discuss them with- out waking up the other guys. what do you think?"
"yes, go ahead. it's c,kay. ,,h _h o_ l,f_ r,r, _'_"" one _f h_ first things w_ want.to do i_ charge the battery in csm, so we can get some i_mpower over there to do that, and we have pro- cedures ginned up to do it. in regards to reentry, we're planning our last mideol_rse at 5 hours before entry interface, and, if we have to make one, that is. and then we'd like to jettison the service module at 4 hours and a "" half, roughly, before entry interface, and take ? the next 3 to 3-1/2 hours for taking pictures, cranking up the command module g&n, taking care of stowage, and other odds and ends. and we'd hang on to the lm until 1 hour before entry interface, and then we'd jettison that. and these procedures are going to be run integrated in the cms and lms tomorrow morning, and, hope- fully, later on in the day, we'll do it again with mission control on the loop. a couple of other things we'd like to toss at you: one question is what do we do with the ops. the thought is that there is adequate 02 in the command module and that the ops represents high pressure source and a stowage problem, and people are thinking about le'tving them in the lm. the other thing is that we think you might want to make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to lm jettison, because what we're doing is, when we jettison the lm, we're going to do it like tap_.74/14 we did in apollo 10 - just let the beatlty go, and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting on the hatch sea to take care of us. so we thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. some of them are ones that are particularly pertinent questions at this tim_."
okay. a suited entry would sort of ... the 1-hour lm jettison ba(k and ... back and forth up to that time .... impede our progress back and forth ....
"we're losing you, jim_"
"okay. i think i've got you back. i guess the midcourse at 5 hours prior to ... 04 14 26 %_5 cc affirmative, jim. midcourse 5 hours prior to entry interface. oh 4 26 35 cdr if that's the case, al.1i'm worried about is having that all squared away. it's long before that ... 1 want everything in its place. ail the stowage cleared a_ay, all the ... ready to go and know exactly what to do and ... so that we can do the midcourse, and ... get into the command module ... je'3tison the service module, and then know exactly how to get into %he lm."
"roger. ail those procedures will work - will be worked out precisely, and we agree that the stowage and all of those peripheral details ought to be taken care of before midcourse."
"and, i guess, that la:;tmidcourse, we'd want to start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we have the power to do so, mainly because of atti- tude control. this last time was fairly easy, but i'm not too sure iowlong we can continue to ..."
"i have ... in, and it seems about as cold as it is now, we'll probably be going into suits long before entry."

"jim, i'm sorry. we'r_ not catching what you're saying. the comm is getting kind of bad right now."
"okay, jack. how do you read now?"
i've still got you with quite a bit of background can hear you.
"okay. my only concern about leaving the eps and/or the plss in the command module _s how soon do we have to live off the command module consumables prior to entry, and the plss has a fan and has a ithium hydroxide ... use the com- mand module system. also, the ops ... right now ... command module ... command module oxygen and electrical power is ... but i had just as soon be ... back in the lm."
"it sounds like the general gist of your comments are that if things remain pretty much as they are now in the command module, you'd just as soon leave the ops in the lm. is that affirm? 04 ih 31 24 cdr that's affirm. 04 ih 31 31 cc okay. and maybe you'd like to think over the suited entry bit a little while."

"okay, jack. let me see if i have it. what we do is point the lm at the earth as we did for the midcourse coas, and we do a body-axis aline on the ags. then you give us an ags ball atti- tude to fly to .... t_e lm, and then we ... point the ... at the moon. then you would update the - give us some cdus to coarse aline .... fine aline ... on star_ or the moon or the earth. stand by. okay. we had another master alarm, jack. i don't see any lights down there, except the battery light's still there. you want - - ... display ecs. okay. and the number 2 battery still has a light on it. i suspect it may be the same problem that we had before ......"
"okay. let us talk it over a second, and we'll tell you what to do."
"jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?"
"yes. that's affirm, jack. 'i'tll'* ' i')1 'i' i'it!""* ' ',!l l)"
"yes. thc battery light's flickering.:,_md it triggers off the master alarm."
"okay. well, that - temperature sensor on bat- tery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and every time it does, it triggers a master alapx, jim."
"okay. same old proble_n, huh?"
yes.
"and, jim, finally on tae p52, we're considering using the - the moon and then the sun for the fine aline."
"okay. the moon and the sun for the fine aline. understand. we'll go through this again here ... 01_14 14055 cdr okay, jack. once - 0n_e i get the spacecraft at the proper attitude ..."
"jim, i didn't copy youc last question due to background noise."
okay. once - once you get the aos ball alined ... command module ...
"after we do the body axis aline on the ags, we can tell you what attitude on the ags ball to fly to in order to poiat the csm optics at the moon or at some star. and then we can, knowing where the optics are pointed, give you an equiv- alent set of cdu angles to put in noun 20 to torque the platform."
okay. i see.
"that's the current thinking. it may change between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's the way it looks, jim. it'll probably be some take-off on that anyway."
"okay. are they planniag on a g&n entry or using another system, like _s or something 1lke that?"
it will be a g&n entry.
nothing like going first class.
"yes. that'll be a switch, won't it?"
"jim, are you brokcn into the food loskor in tho lm yet?"
"that's affirm, jack. i sure have .... away."
"you say you did find everything in order in there, huh? 04 lh _6 20 cdr yes, everything was great."
okay. i'll pass it.
i had a question about that earlier.
"right. oh 14 48 13 cdr iiouston, aquarius. 04 ih 48 16 cc go ahoad."
"i understand that one of your reasons for a suited entry is the fact that the command module hatch ... hasn't been good. it doesn't seem to be any different, but in the other ... our hatch is no better than other spacecraft."
"no, the situation, jim, is that your hatch is as good as any other hatch but that we won't have a chance to verify it until so late in the game, like 1 hour before entry interface, in thss case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit. over."
"oh, okay."
"and that might make your time line a little too crowded, getting your suits on there at the last minute; say, less than an hour before entry interface."
"okay. 0l_14 50 30 cc jim, the next action item we want to pursue is transferring some lm _,ower up to the co_mland module main b so we csn start charging battery, and i guess what we ought to do is start on that one when somebody else gets up to help you there. so, when you decide to get the other guys up, or to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll start working on that. i'll:"" 7_,/ (34 14 51 oj cdit okay. i'ii let you haw_ j_ia'k, ::t_ld f_4': ... when _l the time in_ ...? 04 i)i ', i/_ ((: _ay zl.t?lill, ,ijlll. j _itjll't c_/t!l j.,ll_l . 04 l4 5 ;'_ cdr wm'n in (mr t,ilil(' - what';; th_ gi':t do you t,l:_i c)i9 . . . 04 ih 52 07 cc jim, i didn't catch all of what you said, l _l. l think you wanted to krow wh..n the proc_dur_,_ entry are going to be available and read up _ you. if that's the case, why, we're talking about 120 hours or so. as far as the - charyi battery a, we want to do that as soon as th_ other guys get up to help you. we've already passed up som_, of that pi_ocedure, and we l::_'e a couple of deltas to it."

"stand by .... ok 15 02 40 cmp okay, jack. one question from jim is, he wants to know whether the procedure has been tried ... 'i'a_e 75 2 _ u_ 04 _, okay. try it again, now, jack. what did jim want to know?"
"okay. ho wotlld like to know whether the proce- dure has been tried and whether it has been folmd to be okay; and there's no danger of shorting out any of our batteries or anything we have on boar_t the i_ now. 04 5 04 20 cc okay, jack. this procedure has not been tried out as such; however, the hardware paths through which the current flows are the same ones which we used during translunar trajectory, and there's not a problem with shorting out a descent battery. over. 04 15 04 47 cml: okay. i'll reay that to jim. oh 5 05 09 cc jack, of co_rse, the reason for all of this i,_ that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of the e_lr'y batteries, and we've got to juice that up lo get you home with."
"okay. 0i15 05 30 cc okay. what we owe you from here on out is the actual battery a charge procedure, and then a procedure to turn this all around, again."
"okay. i)oyou have it there, and how long is it ..."
"okay, jack. i have the procedure in front of me. it's about 18 steps, and the reason it's so long is because we're starting from this basic configuration which we gave you earlier. it concerns a charge on battery a, of course, which is our low one. so, when you're ready to copy it, lec me know."
okay. let's go at it.
"okay. are you ready to read - copy it? 04 15 06 53 cmt go ahead. 04 15 06 5_4 cc okay. on panel 250, circuit breaker bat a, power entry/postlanding, close; on panel 275, circuit breaker inve.rtt,:rpower 2, main b, close. next several circuit breakers are on panel 5; pase 55_ circuit breaker bat relay bus, bat a, close_ circuit breaker bps sblnsor unit, ac i_,us2, close; ci_eps smnsor zignal, ac2, close; cb _a'i'tercyitargfr, hain b, close. are you still with me'f"

"okay. good readback, jack. tileonly one is number i - number 4. i didn't get your read- back, but it's eps sensor unit ac bus 2, close. you got that?"
"yes. i r'endthat;bac_ cb eps sensor uijit, close. 04 i5 09 30 cc okay. to continue - to continue on - the s_mle panel, panel 5: circuit breaker, battery charger, ac power, close; circuit breaker battery charger, bat a ciiarge, close; circuit breaker inverter control 2, close; circuit breaker inverter con- trol 3, close; i've got a switch for you, main bus tie, bat a/c, off; and another switch, battery charge to aci. read those back."
"okay, jack. cb bat charger to ac power, close. stand by. okay. i had to get a light here. cb bar charger, bar a ckarge, close; cb inverter control 2, close; cb inverter control 3, close; the two switches, %qinbus tie, bat a/c, off; and the second one, bat charger to ac2."
how about reaching over there on your right-hand side and turning the 2iomed off? see if we can improve the comma little bit.
"okay. how do you read, now?"
"okay. i'm reading you real good now, and i want to verify that the main bus tie that we switched off was bat alfa charlie."
"that's verified; main bus tie, bat alfa charlie, off. and that should ... ,__ 75/4 j':l:_i' ' ""j ac tnver''i;'t2_to main 3. 04 5 12 39 cmp okay. ac i,nverter 2 to slain b."

"okay, jack. it's panel 3, ac inverter 2, main b; inverter 2, ac bus 2, on; ac bus 2 reset to reset and center, bat ciiarger to a, ac indicator select to bat carger. report amps and volts to msfn every 10 minutes foz'the first 30 minutes, and then every 30 minutes on a msfn call. 04 15 1_ 29 cc okay. that's a good readback, jack. now the only thing we owe you is a turnaround from this, which we will have. 04 15 14 40 cmi_ okay. let me ask one question, here. about how long do you think it'll take to charge these batteries?"
it's going to take you about 15 hours.
"jack, about how many s_peres of lm power will this 15 hours ...?"
"stand by. we'll get ii;for you - - 04 15 5 22 cmp how many, jack?"
okay. re got it. he got the question.
"okay, jack. that's going to take 120 mnp-hours out of the lm, which is equivalent to 10 hours, which will put us back to 193 hours, and that's plenty."
"okay. let me relay that to jim here. it'll be 120 amp hours, which leaves us - which puts us back from 203 hours ... to 193 hours. _ e 04 15 16 20 124_1 yes, t_:ere's that much to spare. /415 16 '35 lm_ okay, jack. one question here. if'we have any prohlem._;,_(_titllgup this im power to the csm, is the quickest way to _:_et out of it, return to the nor_ta configuration, as it is for me to just switch the im power to csm to reset then off?"
stand by l.
i would lke to give one quick step in case that gave jim report some sort of problem for us to get out oi'it quickly.
"okay. let us talk it over for a minute, jack. 04 15 17 16 cml? okay. real fine. and while you guys are talk- ing it over, you might read back - rave you got the procedure for rev,rsing this? i'll copy that. 04 15 20 o0 civil okay, jack. are you with me?"
"yes. we're still here, jack. what we want to do is follow you through on this, so we're going to get high bit rate to do it. in answer to your question, to undo this procedure quicky, in the event a problem develops, be sure thab you don't touch the 124power switch because it's got a reset position. but the way to undo it; is go into the csm and on panel 5 open two circuit breakers. and they're some of the first ones we read to you. open lm power-1 _,in b, and open lm power-2 main b. you copy that? 01_15 20 45 cml ()kay. understand. if i want to get out of this real quickly, i have to open just two circuit breakers in the csm; that's on panel 5, lm power- main b, lm power-2 main b."
"okay. aridbefore you go ahead with this, let's establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that. and then as we go through the procedure we want you to wait when you get power on main b so we cart take a look at main b without any loads on it before we start charging the batteries."
"okay. i understand you want high bit rate on the i$_or csm just before we start this? q'q__e 75/0 _a6e 5_q 04 15 21 _0 cc that will be high bit rate on the lm, and stand by cor it. 04 15 21 45 c_' okay. oh 15 21 52 cc okay, jack. before we go ahead with this, what we want to do is read you the reverse - the normal reverse procedure."
okay. i'm ready to copy.
"okay, jack. i got the start on how you reverse this procedure. ready to copy?"
"go ahead, jack. 04 15 23 06 cnv_ oksy. first you want to reverse the battery charge procedure. to do that, on panel b, switch battery ciiarge, off; ac inverter 2, off; pane 5, ii,in bus tie bat alfa charlie, on, up; panel 250, circuit breaker bat alfa, po_r entry, an_?ostianding. open. read back. 01_15 23 59 cmp okay, jack. on panel _,battery charger, off, ac inverter 2, off; on panel 5, main bus tie alfa charlc, on; panel 250, cb bat a, power entry and postlanding, open. 01115 24 23 cc that's affirmative, jack, and then if you'll go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on that list, and just opposite - open them ali up. stand by 1. 04 15 2h 52 cc okay, jack. go back to the battery charge pro- cedure i gave you. and, in order to terminate charge, just - you'll just have to write ""open"" or ""off"" next to the circuit switch that i gave you. so on panel 250, that circuit breaker you've already opened; on panel 275, inverter power-2 main b, open; panel 5, bat relay bus bat a, open; eps sensor unit ac bus 2, open, eps sensor signal ac2, open; battery charger, main b, open; battery charger ac power, open; battery ci_rger, bat a ctlarge, open; inverter control 2, open; inverter control 3, open; you've already done the main bus tie; and then bat ct_rge switch to ac 1. over on panel 3, you have already set the ac inverter 2 to off pa_e 5(0 m_d ,i_cn ii_vertf,r 2 ac btit_ 2, oii'l""; al; bus 2 reu,',t tt, (h'f. you h:,vo already put the 145q'l'!,l!_y ciiargfr, :;witch 'tooff; and your dc 'ndicator select to main b. over."
"okay, jack. do you want me to read it back to you?"
"no, ii'you've got something in the right-hand column for all of t_ose, we don't want to have to do it. and now one more thing i owe you is how to ul_transfer lm power to the csm, and i'll get that _oryou in a jiffy."
okay. i' be standing by to copy it.
okay. we have a last minute change to that.
"iouston, 13. 0il15 33 23 cc go ahead. 04 _q _ o_ _o '""......... one th_ng i guess you probably all have considered it, but what heavy things can we store down there where the srcs normally go to help increase our l over d?"
i understand the question is what kind of heavy things can you store where the srcs go.
"yes. they go down in the leb underneath the computer, and the heavier things you have down there increases the l over d. we don't have any srcs, so i was just wondering what heavy things - we could probably put some cameras, television csxaeras, things like that that nor- mally pretty heavy down there in - that, in our src. no, we can't, put the in our src, but we could put them in that container down there which would help decrease our l over d. any- thing else you can think of would be greatly appreciated because we don't even have a throwaway station, so we're down a little bit in l over d. 01j15 34 33 cc okay. let me pass that question along, and get somebody working on it."

did you say not soon?
"no, we're going to do it pretty soon, but we want to have high bit rate, and we don't want you to give that to us until we teli you."
okay. i think i'll go back and try to undamp up there. do you have anything more for the command module?
"we're di._cussing-two items, but we don't have them ready right now."
"one of them, i hope, is a foolproof alinement proced_zre."
"okay, jack. just for curiosity's sake, does fii)o have any information as to whether that helium - that helium tank dump affected our trajectory at all?"
"okay, aquarius. our tzacking data shows that since the helium dump, our ertry angle bas not changed pa/_e 563 prom it,:_ value of 6.24_ and _omebody ca!cu!at_'d that if we had a propulsive vent, that hc_im_ could roughly, at the maximt_n, only impart a delta-v of a half a foot per second or less, anyway, t_lt we're continuing to track and as soon as we get some more info, we'll pass it along."
"okay. that's swell, jack. thank you."
sure.
"your 6._h sounds good. oh 15 44 14 cdr i'm still awake, i guess."
they said that it would be a while because they warn to get high bit rate. they don't want to put high bit rate ....
"okay, aquarius. we're ready. so we want some high bit rate. to do that, go over to panel 16 under comm and close the primary s-band power amplifi_. on your comm panel - oh 15 46 56 cmp okay. okay, jack. wait 1. while - i'd like to get the whole crew up for this if you don't mind."
okay.
"... they're ready to start. yes, you want to get fred-o up."
"we want to transfer some power - i want to go to high bit rate here first, then want to transfer lm power to csm, fred."
"okay, jim, i'll give you the comm. 04 15 h7 40 cc aquarius, there's no great big rush. if you want to let fred come up to speed slowly, why maybe that'll help out."
okay ....
"and houston, jack is showing fred the procedures before we start up."
"say again, jim."

yes. we're watching him.
"boy, if you took 120 hours out. oh .... okay ...."
"houston, aquarius."
"hello, fred. go ahead."
"okay, i guess the only question i have is in the first - the very first portion involving the lm here where it has me tl_rnon the only bat 6, and then turn off all the descent batteries. are you still reading me?"
"okay. i read you until after turn off bat 6 - correction, turn on only bat 6."
"okay, the question is ""only one ascent battery bat 6 on the line,"" iimnediately followed by turning off four deoce _ bats is that correct?"
"that's affirmative, fred. that question has been banged around and we decided to go that way. 0_115 55 38 lmp let's see, we will be powering other bus via the cross tie balance loads breaker. is that correct?"
"2_nat's affirmative, and we're reading a current of 11 amps right now."
"okay. okay. i guess i'm ready, then. that's 11 amps?"
"and after you turn bat 6 on the line, you might as well take a look at the bats 1 through 4 and so forth, and make sure that it's okay to turn them off. i'_w_c',t,5"

"okay, aquarius; and jack can get with it right now."
okay.
"okay, houston; aquarius. we've completed the powerup and things look good upstairs. are we go for proceeding with battery charge?"
"okay, aquarius; you're go on the battery charge."
"roger. 04 16 07 36 i_mp boy, this is really a switch, isn't it, jack?"
"that's an understatement. you're not known for that. 04 16 07 54 ,sip yes. i think if you add up the - yes - if you add up the operating time, i think the lm beats the csm by a considerable margin on this flight."
grumman just hired you. 04 16 05 38 tap yes.
"you're out there at 134000, coming in at about 4900 feet a second."
very good.
"the s_percrit tank went off at about 19:3', just _b_j_ like _e_."
"yes. it - it also must of not did very much, ex- cept the rates. i was asleep then and i didn't hear a thing."
is the command - service module still venting?
"jack said it was just before he went up. right now, the sun's over there, and i can't really tell - -"
and - - 04 16 10 44 co we asked him a long time ago if he was able to see any stars out the optics. i don't think we ever got an answer.
"okay. 04 16 11 04 imp that's a pretty good sleep station i had rigged up, jack. i took one of the sleep restraints out of the command module, zipped up in it, and then hooked the tie, right at the top of the zipper, onto the lm upper hatch handle. so it kind of held me there, and then just drifted up in the tunnel upside down with my face toward the hatch, so the sunlight didn't get in my eyes and that worked pretty good."
did you sleep pretty well that way?
"yes, no problem at all."
"is jim sleeping that way now, or is he standing next to you? 04 16 11 49 imp he's standing next to me."
"about time for him to go to bed. tapers/ll, i'age 5(:7"
"okay. t_levoltage upstairs _s 34.3 and the charger is reading 2,5 amps."
okay b4.b and 2.5. and ... says ... - - 04 16 12 11 iapp - - pretty cold. good.
"say again your last. 04 16 12 16 i_p they came - both came down here rubbing their hands, shivering. it's pretty cool upstairs."
are you keeping warm in the lm?
yes. it's pretty reasonable down here.
"okay. and right now, it looks like ... right now, it looks like the command module isn't venting, jack, so i'm going to try to take a look at the optics."
okay. you say it is not venting?
yes. that's the word. we've just looked through the a0t and you can't see anything back there.
okay. and everything's fine in e1 lago.
very good.
"aquarius, we're ready to secure the high bit rate."
"okay. 04 16 16 32 i_mp houston, aquarius; how do you read?"
"i'm hearing you with a lot of background noise, fred-o."
okay. how now? i just switched omnis again.
"aquarius, could you get a - amps and volts readout from odyssey, please? 04 16 23 45 i2_p okay. stand by."
the cmp is dotting across there. you'd be amazed at how proficient you get at transfering to the tunnel after the first 1000 times.
"i didn't get your last there, fred-o. we'd like you to verify that your power amplifier circuit breaker is open. 04 16 24 44 _mp okay. that's verified. power ampl breaker is open."
"roger. 04 16 25 00 i_p okay, jack; that's 34.6 volts and just a little bit under 2.5 amps."
"okay, fred. i copied 2.5 amps. say again the volts, please. 04 16 25 15 i_mp 34.3 and that was just a little bit below 2.5."
34.3; thank you. 04 16 25 33 imp okay .... point ...
"fred-o, i didn't copy the last. say again the voltage_ please."
"okay, and the volt_ge is 34.6 - 34.6 amps, slightly less than 2.5."
34.6 and a little below 2.5. thank you.
"we're - the way we are torquing around to the side here, jack - we are getting some intervals where i can't hardly get to it with either of the omnis. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, hous- aquarius."
okay. jack reports from upstairs that he can see stars and constellations out of the optics but the sun angle is such that it is reflecting off the lm - portion of the lm quad and other thruster ... right now .... really moving around ...
okay. the part i got was that he can see stars and constellations and there is some sunlight reflected off the quads. that's all i got.
"yes. the point being that, at least in the present orientation, you have to kind of wait until sun isn't reflected off the lm to see them."
okay. what you're saying is you kind of have to wait until the - there is no sun reflection on the lm to see the stars. is that right?
"yes. that's for the present orientation, of collrse."
"but later on, if you can stop it moving around and ...... 04 16 34 35 cc okay - -"
"... 04 16 34 47 co okay, fred-o. and we need a volts and amps reading."
"okay. and bring it back upstairs. 04 16 35 36 _ okay. the volts, 35.0; amps, 2.4."
"okay. 35.0 and 2.4. thanks, fred."
"the weather prediction for your landing area is still good; 2000 scattered, high scattered; 4-foot seas, 15-knots wind. there's a hurricane 500 miles to the west, which doesn't pose a problem. 04 16 39 02 i24p a hurricane or a typhoon?"
delay my last. it's degraded to a tropical storm.
"aquarius, houston. we need another readout amps and volts, and that will be our last one for a half hour. over."
"okay. the reading is 37.8 volts, 2.3 amps."
"say again, fred."
"37.8 volts, 2.3 amps."
"37.8 and 2.3. and that will be our last one for a half hour. thank you. and i'm about to exercise my fifth general order here, and pass it along to joe."
yes. it must be getting around a mealtime.
"aquarius, houston. over."
...
"okay. this is your friendly do-it-yourself- kit comm with a suggested procedure in the lithium hydroxide situation. you're looking good. we read 1.8 millimeters, and you do have sufficient lm ... to last you the rest of the flight. however, being on the conservative side, we would like to use one more set of command module canisters to guard against some possible problems with the lm, primary canister. and i have a simplified procedure for doing that, if you want to listen to it now. over."
"okay. i think i read that you were ready. i forgot ... earphones. this simply consists of getting a second pair of cartridges out of the command module, putting one band of sticky tape, that is the gray tape, with the sticky side out, around the sides of each new canister near the top, taking a piece of eva cue card and cutting it into four squares about 2 or 3 inches on a side, bending those at a right angle to form corner support, attaching them to the sticky tape, so that they'll stick up and overlap the old canister, and then simply putting the old canister next to the new canister and taping it up real good so it sticks together. the only other procedure is to remove the towel plug from the old cartridges and put it in the bottom of the new cartridge. and that's it. over."
"okay. as i read youj we get the gray tape and fold it so that we get - the back sticks around the outside of the canisters, then we mount to that four sides of our ... cards like our eva ... cards; then we overlap those cards down around the base of the canister. then we - then we ... over the ... at the top .... then we take the towel from the old ones and put them in the bottom of the new ones ......."
"okay, fred. i think you got it. i didn't com- pletely copy your readback, but it's just that simple. we're just putting the new cartridge - the top of the new cartridge against the bottom of the old one, moving that towel plug, using the cue cards as little corner stiffeners, and taping her up."
okay. the top of the new against the bottom of the old.
roger that. that way you don't have to touch the hose.
"hey, for a change, i took the ... lm ... this morning, joe."
okay. go ahead.
i got ...
"i'm afraid i didn't copy that, fred, and while i was listening, eecom told me that he'd like another battery charge ... readout."
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go."
"you want us to start on this lithium right now, joe, or is it necessary?"
"it's not time-critical, fred, but if you have the people awake now, you might go ahead and do it. incidentally, you probably know this, but the next several hours are going to be pretty quiet from our point of view. we're working on the entry procedures and should he ready to read them up to you in about 8 hours; and between now and then there's not an awful lot going to be going on, so you guys could be catching up on your sleep schedule. over. 04 17'23 22 l_tw_ okay, jo_."
and we would like another readout on the amps and volts. 04 17 23 31 l55 roger.
"okay. the volts, joe, are 38.9 and the amps are 1.9."
"okay. copy that, fred. thank you very much; 38.9 and 1.9. and eecom is simply making as smooth a plot as he can to verify the amount of amps we're putting back into the battery. that's why he wants it at half-hour intervals. if that schedule begins to interfere seriously with your rest cycle or so, give us a call. over."
okay. _.
"yes. jim's sleeping now, and jack and i are awake and i just finished sleeping around, i guess, about another 5 or 6 hours, so i'm not particularly inclined to go back to sleep right now."
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
"okay. we've got one of them ready to go, and it looks like we could do a pretty good job just using the tape strips. first combining them together and then just using a piece of paper and the bag ... get a pretty good seal ..."
"hey; okay, fred. we suspected that you'd gotten at least one on. we've noticed a partial pressure drop from the 1.8 to 0.8, which is real good."
okay. you might run that by the cpcb and see if they approve our in-house ...
roger that.
"aquarius, houston."
"aquarius, houston. 04 17 40 26 i2v_ go ahead, jo_."
"roger. we're convening the cpcb on that change, fred, but flight has given you an interim go- ahead. over."
okay.
"and, how do you read now?"
"not too had, fred."
okay. we've got both canisters completed now.
"okay. roger that, fred. and you're reading 0.1 again on the co2. incidentally, are you guys having good luck getting water out of the command module?"
we - we haven't tried that yet today.
okay.
yes. this is quite an apparatus hanging on to these hoses now. and that ecs design engineer ·.. because it sure seems to work.
roger that.
"and, aquarius, houston. at your convenience, we'd like another volts and amps readout."
okay.
"how do you read, joe?"
"pretty good, fred."
"okay. volts, 39.0; amps, 1.7."
"39.0, 1.7. thank you. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
"aquarius, houston. go ahead. you're pretty weak."
i didn't call you_ joe.
say again.
i didn't call.
"oh, sorry about that. incidentally, fred, if switching omnis every couple of minutes bugs you, you can skip it for now. we can always wait until you come around."
"no, it doesn't. this is jack, joe. fred ... it doesn't bother me at all."
okay.
just happy to know that you're standing by.
roger that. except i'm sitting by.
did that co2 drop?
"joe, how far out are we now and how fast are we closing?"
"okay, jack. the plot shows you about 130 000 miles out, which is about, gee, 10 000 closer than you were when i came on a couple of hours ago. and let me check with fido for your rate of closure."
"hey, jack. over."
go ahead.
your smiling fido says you're making 5040 in a 5000-mile zone
i can't ... i ...
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, joe."
"roger, jack. hate to keep bugging you, but we would like another volts and amps reading. over."
okay. we'll get it for you.
good show.
"joe, did our sticky mod on that - those co2 canisters work? i'm sorry - ..."
"jack, i think you asked if the canister mod was working and the answer is, it sure as hell is."
"okay, joe. i got the voltage. it's 39.0 amps and 1.75."
copy 39.0 and 1.75.
"houston, do you read aquarius?"
"aquarius, houston. that's affirmative."
okay. we had a dropout there for a few minutes. ... on either antenna.
"gee whiz, jack, i - when did it happen? over."
just now. i just got you back.
"okay. we had a handover, but that was about a half an hour ago, and i didn't call you on it. let me check with inco and see if he thinks everything's okay. your comm sounds just as good as it's ever been."
yes. i'm in real good shape.
"jack, houston. over."
go ahead.
"roger. we're checking into it. we think we lost lock in madrid for a while, and we've got it back now."
okay. real fine ....
okay.
you might also check with fido whether we ... perigee ...
you're getting a little weak. did you say you wanted to verify what - what your vacuum perigee is? over.
yes ....
"jack, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay. the good fido gives us a vacuum perigee at the present time of 23.6 with a flight path angle of minus 6.25 degrees. that's without a midcourse. he's kind of tossing around the idea of doing a midcourse-7 maneuver at 5 hours before entry. if we do it, it looks like it won't be more than 2 feet per second. over."
okay.
"and, jack, houston. we verified that that c0_4 problem was a ground problem."
okay. thank you. that fid0 is really cooking today.
"oh, he's having a ball."
it must be because we haven't made any waste water dumps.
(laughter)
you can tell jay and david that i went for a whole flight and didn't use the bathroom.
(laughter) he copies that. david's here; he says you've kept him so busy he hasn't had time to work on his stereo all week.
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"jack, we'd like another volts and amps reading at your convenience. 0_,19 09 25 cmp okay, houston. it'_ 39.2 '/o_ts; /.6 f_lf_l_s."
"okay. thank you. we copy; 39.2 volts, and 1.6 amps."
right.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go."
i just relieved the watch; just thought i'd find out how things are going.
"okay, jim. good morning; and understand you relieved the watch, and the rest was kind of blurry. did you have any questions?"
"no questions, joe. just ... apuijlo i3 air-to-gr(/tjitlv_oice tran_cription"
"okay. that was - that was loud and clear, that one there. now we don't have a heck of a lot going on as you know we're working on the entry procedures. i've got preliminary copies, but we're not ready to pass - to pass it up to you. looks like you're about 125 000 miles out, starting to - starting to really pick up speed, and the astros won last night, and that's about all i've got. over."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay, jim. it's about time, at your convenience, for another volts and amps reading on the command module. for your information, we put 6 amp-hours back in the battery already and we've got about 14 to go. it's looking real good, and i also just got the word that the entry weather tomorrow is looking better all the time. really looks great."
"that's good. when i went to bed last night, ... a lot of rain ..."
"couldn't copy that, jim. sorry."
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
roger. 39.2 on the volts; 1.4 on the amps.
39.2 and 1.4. thank you.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"roger. just for your information, in case it happened when you were off watch, the master caution circuit breaker is still pulled, and we're seeing the - the malfunction indication on the descent battery now, but all the param- eters still look just as good as ever, and that's just for information."
"okay. i see the battery light flickering now. t_p,' 78/2 'age 579"
okay. recommend you ignore it.
okay.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, it's volts and amps time again, at your convenience."
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. if you gave me those read- ings, i didn't copy them. over."
"houston, aquarius. do you read?"
"aquarius, houston. okay; go ahead."
"volts, 39.3; amps, 1.25."
"okay. copied 39.3 and 1.25. jim, did jack tell you what your trajectory looks like? over."
haven't got up to ... on it. how about giving me a rundown?
"okay. we are looking at a vacuum perigee right now of 23.6; flight path angle of minus 6.25; and if we decide we want to trim that up, we're looking at a midcourse of about 2 feet per sec- ond. your consumables_ of course, are getting better all the time; we've got 163 hours of water, 230 hours of oxygen, and 172 hours worth of electrical power. over."
that sounds good.
roger.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. we would like to get another check from you on the propellant tank temperatures, as we did yesterday. and the procedure is to, on panel 16, circuit breaker propellant, display/ engine, ov_ride/logic to close. then go to your display and read the tank 1 and tank 2 tempera- tures for us, and then open the circuit breaker again. over."
"okay. i'm closing now - the display/engine, override/logic."
roger.
okay. and the reaction control temperatures are 65 in a and 65 in b.
"okay, jim. we'd like the descent tank tempera- tures, too. over."
"67; oxidizer is 63; descent tank 1 ... is 64; the oxidizer is ... did you copy? over. 01421 02 22 cdr hello, houston. did you copy the - the dps dis- play temperatures?"
"jim, i copied 63 and 64, which i think were the descent 1 temps, and that's all i got."
"okay. i'll go over it again. i'm on descent 1, now and fuel is about 64, and oxidizer is 65, and i'll go to descent 2 - -"
okay. thank you very much - -
- - our descent 2. okay. i've got descent 2 now right up on 67 and 66.
"roger. we copy that, and once again we'd like to get the volts and amps check in the command module. over."
"okay. i'm going to go up there and get it. jack is - and fred are asleep, so i'll be off the air a minute."
okay. real good.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go."
"volts, 39.3; amps, 1.2 zip. 04 2 05 45 cc okay. we copy 39.3 and 1.20. and, jim, i've got one more item for information for you. at - in about 45 minutes or so, you will get an li_o quantity caution light on the descent tank. wa expect this. it occurs at 16 percent. and it's no problem, because we intend to run the tank dry just for drill. to reset the - the light, on panel 2, just set the 02 h20 quantity monitor to the caution/warning reset position and the light will go away. over."
"okay. i understand. we're going to get a h20 warning light here shortly, and i'll reset it."
okay. good deal. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice tra_tscription
"houston, apollo 13."
"aquarius, houston; go _dlead."
"okay, joe, we got the water warning light."
okay. roger that.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. the experts would like another volt and amp reading."
okay; have them stand by.
"okay, no rush."
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston; go _d%ead."
"voltage is 39.3, amps 1.26."
copy 39.3 and 1.26.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston; go."
"joe, you might pass to our friends in crew systems that lunar boots make great footwarmers."
"i guess you need them up there, too. is - is anybody sleeping in the command module right now, jim?"
"negative, joe. it's just too cold in there. i got fred stashed over here to my left. he's asleep and jackrs ..."
roger.
you can eliminate the chilldown procedure for reentry.
"(laughter) well, we figured we were in that mode now ·"
"aquarius, this is earth. over."
"go ahead, earth; aquarius here."
"roger. earth is here, also; and, jim, it is time for another one of those volt/amp checks. for your information, we've got that battery back up to 30 amp-hours now. over."
"hey, that sounds great. jack's gone up to check it."
roger.
"aquarius, earth. oh 22 26 37 cc go ahead."
"you know, i think aquarius is ..."
"we've got garble now, jim; itm sorry."
i said aquarius ...
roger.
"houston, aquarius."
go ahead.
"voltage 39.3, amps 1.26."
"okay. copy that, jim."
"jim, houston. have you guys put on any extra clothes to try and ward off the nip of jack frost? over."
"well, the lunar boots and two pair of underwear, and everyone is ... crawl into their sleep restraints."
yes.
we're a little reluctant to break out the suits.
"yes, that's understandable, you can always use them if you have to. i guess it's pretty hard to get extra coveralls on, huh?"
"well, joe, i didn't think we had any extra inflight garments aboard, but we're going to check right now."
"well, stand by."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. jim, we noticed you just went to auto and back to close on the suit relief valve. is everything okay?"
we didn't do that intentionally. stand by.
"okay, maybe you didn't. incidentally, you're less than 24 hours to go."
"roger. what happened was, our lithium hydroxide device here got caught in the suit relief valve. it is closed now. that's where you want it, right?"
okay. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription pa_o 585
okay.
"and, joe, just a reminder; now that you mention it - that it's less than 24 hours to go, what i'd like to do, and i have aboard all the pro- cedures that you are working up; so i can run through them with the crew, and make sure that we get all our signals straight."
"roger that, jim. we are trying to get the procedures finished and up to you as quickly as we can. they exist. what's going on now is the guys are running them in the cms/les, integrate, to make darn sure that the attitudes are correct and the time line is nice and re- is.xed and all that good stuff. and they won't be finished that run for another few hours. however, we expect to have an overall time line and a sequence of events for you before that time, and we'll start with the procedures as soon as they get ready. over."
okay. that's good. i think ... ought to go back to the original procedures we have on board and modify them as we have the time to.
"okay, jim. roger. we're going to do that to the maximum extent possible. and it looks reasonably feasible. to begin with in the com- mand module we're going to have to send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little bit at a time. the closer we get to entry the more we get on the checklist. by the time we're about at ei minus 45 we're on the checklist all the way."
okay.
"and just as a reminder, don't forget our stowage problem. we - we still have to do quite a bit of stowage of the drogue and probe in the im, and, et cetera."
"roger that. we've got a team working on that, and incidentally, one of the information items that they want to know is which lithium hydroxide containers in the command module are empty. they just want to know that for weight and balance - and there's no rush about it - - oh 22 47 18 cdr ..."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"another note of interest to the crew systems people - tell them that they don't have to bother putting the refrigerator onboard. i just brought out some hot dogs, and they're practically frozen."
"(laughter) okay. we copy that, jim."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. we'd like another volt, amp reading, jim."
"okay. stand by, joe."
roger.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim."
"volt 39.4, amp 1.23."
"okay. roger that. and, jim, we ought to have a - an entry time line to discuss with you in one hour."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
guess what.
what?
"your volts and amps time, jim."
that goes like the amos and andy show.
"houston, aquarius. guess what."
"aquarius, houston. what? over."
"39.4, 1.27."
"are you really going up there, and looking at them?"
that's what the meters say.
"okay. we copy, jim. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead. 05 00 17 3_ cc okay, jim. we show the suit circuit relief valve is back in the auto position, and we'd like to have it off for good scrubbing. over."
have you seen ... out there?
"okay. thank you, jim."
... up there - about ... of the scrubbers. if you think ...
"roger. no sweat. jim, in a few minutes i'm going to be coming at you with the - with the overall time line for tomorrow morning. you might want to think about taking a few notes, although we don't have detailed procedures for you at this time. maybe you want to have fred or jack listen. over."
right. we're alt set to copy.
okay.
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"for our benefit while we do this briefing, jim, we'd like to have the, the comm better, and we can sure spare the power; so we'd like you on panel 16 to close the power amplifier circuit breaker, and on panel 12 we'd like you to move the voice function switch to voice. over."
"okay, aquarius; houston. how do you read?"
read you loud and clear.
"okay, and you're real good. it's a - it's a pleasure not to have all that noise. let me tell you what i want to do, jim. as i said, we're not going to give you detailed procedures, now. what we expect to have for you shortly are pro- cedures which we'll try and get up to you in the following form. first, we'll have a time line, 1 sort of a flight plan thing, which will have the times of all the major events and any configura- tions, switch settings, and so forth which are peculiar to our configuration and which, there- fore, you won't find in the checklist. this, for instance, will be true of the way we power up the command module; and second, of course, we'll have any redlines to the checklist so that you can enter the checklist where possible to - to perform functions, and the time line will simply refer you to the checklist when that's appropriate. okay?"
"okay. bounds good. you're going to give me an overall time line now, i take it; is that right?"
"that's affirm. i'm going to first of all just quickly run through the times of the major events, and then we'll go back and fill in some of the details. okay. entry interface is at 142 hours 40 minutes; 6-1/2 hours, roughly prior to that or at about 136:10, we'll start this whole thing going by applying imu heater power, by checking the cm/rcs temperatures and preheating the cm/rcs if required, and we suspect we'll probably want to do that. we'll have detailed procedures up for it later. at about 6 hours prior to ei or about 136:40, we will commence powering up the lm, powering up the ags, using the modified lm/dps rcs 30-minute checklist, which you have used for the previous midcourse. then shortly, just before 5 hours, prior to ei or at about 137:49, we'll want you in the attitude for a lm ags body axis alinement, using the earth terminator like we did before; and as soon as we have that, we'll perform mcc-7, which looks like, now, about a 2-foot-per-second burn or about 15 seconds of rcs. and i'm told that it's dovn to 1-1/2 now, so it's comfortably within the rcs margin. okay. when we do that, we'll immediately start the maneuver to the service module jettison attitude, which will be in plane since we're jettisoning it earlier than we usually do. we don't need, and don't want, the out-of- plane component. so it'll be in plane with the service module pointed back out along the radius vector. we will then commence to get the command module ready for service module sep, including command module rcs checkout and hot fire, and at approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes prior to ei or 1_8:10, we'll jettison the service module. we'll pitch the _m up until we aquire the service module in the ... and try and get some photographs, but we're not going to fool around with lm translation maneuvers for pictures because we don't want to screw up - foul up your flight path angle at that time. okay. that gives us 2 hours to - of more or less open time here to finish up, if we're late on that, to go on over to checklist and prepare for powering up the command module. we're going to start the command module full powerup at ei minus 2 hours and 30 minutes or 140:10 get. we'll get the computer on the line, we'll get the imu up, we'll start uplinking your state vectors, and so forth_ and alining the command module platform. at about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the latest, giving us an hour to do this command module stuff, we will start the maneuver to the lm jettison attitude. you'll then start to close out the lm. of course, we don't have our stowage all configured way before this. we'll close the hatch, do a pressure integrity check, and at ei minus 1 hour, or 141 hoars and 40 minutes, we'll jettison the i_m. as soon as we do that, you can start the maneuver to the entry attitude. when you're there, do a sextant star check, take down the optics, and at that point we'll be giving you your final entry pad. you can initialize the ems, and you'll essentially be right back on the checklist at that point. there's one - one little difference from your nominal entry. you're a little bit earlier in the morning, so it going - it's going to be nighttime when you get to ei. however, we're fortunate enough to have the moon in a perfect position for a horizon check. we'll give you a moon check instead of a horizon check, and you can track it right down to moonset, which is going to be at ei roughly minus 3 minutes. and that's it for the quick time line. do you have any questions right now?"
"i don't believe so, joe, right now. we'll have to look at those time lines, and think about it for a little bit."
"okay. real fine. we're ready to talk in some more detail about the alinement procedures, the cm powerup procedures, and so forth, but why don't we give you a few minutes to digest what you've already heard."
"houston, aqua_'u:_."
"go ahead, l_qual,'as."
"two quest,ion_ !;ofar on heating up the cm/rcs. we assume i,h_t's lm power, and we assume that we're goin?;*'_.._...__..._...l) _.,.,.,.-.,.,u..p._.both cm buses, right?"
"okay, jim. i didn't waistto talk about that because we're not quite ready to recommend a procedure. we can't power up tile cm/rcs per the nornal ehecklj st on t.hclm power because we haven't got quite enou_h amps. it may he that we'_ want you to heat - to do the preheat one ring at a time and we're looking at 'that. another possibility' is t_latwe may want to take down lm power at ibat,time, d_)the preheat, and then go backlto _p_c'r uritii we have to take it down f_naly. over."
"okay. understand. oec.,nt question: when we finish mcc-7, that maneuver to sm jet'attitude will be angles given to tis,by you, using the ags aline ball, right.?"
"that's afflrmagive. (luc_wo get 'that ags alined and get a time hack on it, the good people down here will be able to give us ags - ags, 8-ball attitudes for the service module separation attitude, for the co_mnand module alinement attitude, which we are i:_.ointo_ pass you up the - a moon/sim p52-type a.:i_l_:.m_-_wneb'.ll have ags 8-ball attitudes for those, and we'll be able to uplink through the command module once we get the comput,_t'up a p_:'efer r_.,: /e_'smmat,which will be identical l() the ,ma.tt, l'_,,,udeat the time of the burn. a:ud we'll ,_ into d__,_ai-_., ' on that later."
okay. just stand by l. t'll give it to you.
will do.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim."
"we would like to have plenty of ... the control characteristics are of the lm/command module, and wh_q,h_r'w_._n ns_'he attitude control - control_,t.,_nlyi_,._meuv(_r the combination to photogra_h the _e_'v_(_emodule _t 4 plus 30."
"okay. good thinking. we are - it's - there has been a lot of consideration of what kind of maneuvers to let you do to i_botograph the lm, i mean the service module. we consider it quite low priority; the feeling is that it will be real nice to get pictures of the service module, but they are not required for our troubleshooting program. as far as the - the attitude control authority, and so fortb_ we will get you more detailed word on that later; we are working it. it appears that using the a(a instead of the ttca after s_rvluu module jett will give you excellent attitude control authority, and that's what we recon_nend."
okay. and i'm ... - use an ags att hoi_ confignlra- tion to keep the attitudes - turn the lm jett attitude s.
that's affirm. we are - we are probably going to recommend a tight deadband ags attitude hold for that.
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
go ahead.
"okay. the star c?,eck al the entry attitude, is it a sextant star check or a coas star check?"
"it'll probably be a s_.%_nt star check, jim. it really depends on how 6ood that platform is that we get. and we expect it to be plenty good enough for a sextant star check_"
okay.
"%fnile we are on that subject_ jim, i want to mention one thing to jack. as i said, this csm alinement procedure we are going to recommend is a moon/sun, and there are sim filters stowed; they are stowed in compartment r-i; however, they are for the telescope only, of course, not the sextant. one is for the long eye-relief piece, the _tber for the normal eyepiece. and if he ha::ujlyquestions about that, we'll be glad to talk about it."
okay.
"and because it will be too late to do much about a hatch integrity check if it fails, you want us to have our suits on sometime during this period?"
"okay, jim. we are laying for you on that one; it is a subject that we wanted to - to bring up with you. we have been considering it _ and our feelings are - of course, it is up to you, but as we see the pros and cons, you just put your finger on tilepro. we do a hatch integrity check shortly before ei minus 1 hours, and if we bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling into the suits. on the other hand, the disad- vantages of wearing the suits are that they might slow you down considerably, not even counting the time to don them, and someone is even very concerned that after such and such a period of time in the suits, you might get too warm, and we might have to power up the suit loop to ventilate the suits and we don't particularly want to do that because it cost quite a bit of power. consequent- ly, our recommendation was going to be that you not wear the suit, since we have no reason to believe that the integrity check will show us anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and we can certainly hack that. what do you think? over."
"weil, i have confidence in the hatch, as long as it goes in and locks in smoothly; i see no reason why we need the suits, and one thing we are going to do during our spare time is to practice putting that hatch on, make sure we get it on and locked."
"okay. real good. and with that precaution, think we can concur on that decision."
and that's all the questions we had about the time line you gave us.
"okay. let me take a check here and see if there is anything anybody else wants to input to you, right now. 'age594 05 o0 '_8 5)1 f;c aquatic.:;, ifou::ton. 05 o0 38 58 cdh go ahead."
"roger. one detail that i thought you ought to know about the service module jett is that we're going to recommend a push-pull maneuver, that is in the attitude i described. we'll want you to go half a foot per second plus-x on the lm, then jettison the service module, then go half a foot per second minus-x, which will be less time be- cause you're suddenly a heck of a lot lighter. over."
"oksy. understand. you want me to go a half a foot per second plus-x_ jett the service module, and go a half a foot per second minus-x."
"that's affirm. we think that will give you plenty of separation, and also will be a slow enough rate so you'll have a chance to get some photos."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. one more thing we want to update you on with a little detail. as we told you, the ascent sep attitude was in plane and the lm jett atti- tude will be more similar to a normal service module sep attitude, that is it will be lm up, out the radius vector smd 45 degrees right, out of plane toward the south. we are going to recom- mend that prior to jett, the configuration be with the lm overhead hatch closed, with the vent valve open, and we'll jett with the tunnel pressurized. over."
"okay, joe. understand that the lm jett attitude will be similar to service module normal jettison, which will be up and out of plane, and as soon as i finish maneuvering to left jett attitude, i'll scramble up and close the lm hatch, making sure the vent valve is open, and then we'll vent it - or jettison it with the tunnel pressurized."
"that's affirmative. and deke says don't forget to close the command module hatch on your way in. tap,?81/5"
i'm already scared that jack will have it closed before i get up there.
(laughter)
"okay, jim. i think that's about all we have for you right now. whenever you feel like you don't have any more questions at the moment, we'd like you to reeonfigure for down voice backup and we'd like you to do that to move the voice function switch to downvoice baceqjp as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit breaker, we'd like you to throw the power amp switch to off."
"okay, joe. i have one more question, here. if we get a little bit ahead of time on the command module full powerup after we jettison the ser- vice module, i'd like to go to lm jett attitude early, and make sure we get that part squared aw_ and sit there for a while before lm jett of i hour. now, will we be using lm power up to that time? there's two cables which we'll probably have to disconnect on the w_y up through the tunnel if we're still going to use lm power?"
that's affirmative. let me get word on when we expect to go off lm power.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"roger. we expect to go off lm power at the time we start powering up the csm or about minus 2-1/2 hours. that is not a hard number, and we'll be updating you on it. as far as going to the ia jett attitude, that's completely permissible as soon as you have a powered up command module and a satisfactory platform, you can go there immediately. we're giving you a maximum of i hour just for grins. over."
"ok_kv. fine. and that will be a lm maneuver, i assume, because we lost the service module, so no strain there."
affirm.
"and, jack, would like to knc_ what entry angle the mdcourse-_7 will g_ve us?"
"oh, it'll l_utus right in the middle of the corridor, ,lim."
okay.
"6.50 d_'gt...s... and, jim, houston. i guess, as a last il,r,r,w,e expect that it will take us about an hour to update your checklist and your tim,?lines sometime later on today, and we'd just like you to consider that. i expect it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that stuff ready."
"okay. we'll be standing by for that, and now power am3't.71fierswitch is going to go off, and then we' be going to down voice ba(,nfup. 05 o0 l_639 cc okay."

"39.4, and say again amps."
1.25.
roger. copy. thank you.
"okay, vance. we're ready to cover - to copy the stowage list."
"okay, jim. now, i'll give it to you in two parts. the first is lm to command module equipment trans- fer. the second part will be the reverse, command module to lm equipment transfer. and both parts represent deltas from the launch stowage, and here comes the first list, lm to command module equip- ment transfer. first, dsea, and i'll give you the stowage location, too. that goes in r-13."
"vance, what was that again?"
dsea; that's recorder in - will go in the command module; it's recommended you stow it in r-13. over.
"okay, the dsea - that's the recorder - will be stowed in r-13."
"that's affirm. next. lm flight data file. that will go in r-i, r-2, and r-3. next. three ppks in a-8."
okay.
"okay. 16-millimeter and 70-millimeter exposed film in r-13. okay, next. 02 hose screen caps on the 02 hoses. next: two 70-millimeter has- selblad cameras, and stow these in b-6 in the empty lioh volume."
"okay, next. black-and-white tv camera, and rec- ommend stow that on top of a-7 and a-ii in decon- tamination bag. next: flag kit, stowage location a-8. next: lm fecal bags, used, r-9, waste man- agement system chute."
"okay, that's the first list, jim."
okay.
"and, if you want to read that one back, why then i'll - i'll give you the second one."
"this is the lm to command module transfer, and this is the delta from the launch stowage. num- ber 1: dsea ...; number 2: lm flight data file in r-i, r-2, r-3; three ppks in a-8 ... -"
... a-8; and used lm fecal bags in r-9.
"okay, that's affirm, jim. we had a lot of noise, and we didn't get the middle part, but i think that's fairly - should be fairly clear to you, and don't bother with the readbaek of that that we missed, unless you have any doubts. and then i'll, if you're ready to copy, i'll give you the second list."
okay.
"okay. this is cm to lm equipment transfer. cabin fan filter and bag, and that, in the lm, should go in the isa. okay, next: decontamination bags, except for the ones used to wrap camera, should go in the isa."
"okay. two lcgs, if you don't have them on already, to the is - isa. i realize you wouldn't have them on, because you're cold enough already."
that's right.
"okay, and finally, four li0h cans, the ones used in the lm, and those can go in the jettison bag in the lm. okay, a couple of notes. after load- ing the isa, recommend secure it to the right- hand restraint system."
and secure the jettison bag to the plss on the floor. and that's all.
"okay, vance. this is command module to lm: cabin fan filter and bag in the isa; decontamination bags, except for the ones we use for the tv camera, in the isa; two lcgs in the isa; four l0ih sic cans in the jett bag; and we'll secure the isa on the right-hand side - on the right-hand restraint system, and we'll secure the jett bags to the plss on the floor."
roger. that's it.
"aquarius, liouston. over."
"aquarius, ttouston."
go ahead.
"jim, would you give us pcm to hi bit rate. we think maybe we might be able to lock up on your high bit rate now. over."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, jim. we're getting it intermittently. we think we might get it steady and improve circuit margins if you would, in addition, on panel 16, open the primary power ampl circuit breaker, and i'll give you next step in a minute."
okay. primary power ampl is opened.
"okay. and on panel 12, power ampl to primary."
power ampl to primary.
roger.
"aquarius, 13."
"go ahead, houston."
"or rather, houston. jim, it looks like we got a loekon, which is going to improve our data flow here. only thing is, we'll probably lose data and probably voice, too, during a portion of each roll. so you might expect that. the other thing is, if anyone has on any biomed, would you switch your switch to - your biomed switch to that position."
"understand the first, vance, and no one has on any biomed - -"
okay.
"- - fred and jack are maneuvering things around right now, and mine is long since departed the scene. tape 8214"
okay. copy.
"vance, you might be interested - the way we're - the way we got this thing arranged, we have one helmet attached to the comm lines attached to the lm hoses, and the guy that's got the duty wears the helmet, so the other people are free to maneuver."
"right. that's understandable. one guy's on the leash, huh?"
yes ....
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"jim, when you get finished moving your stowage around and it's convenient, we'd like to terminate the battery charge for a little while to bring up the cm tm so we can take a look at the temperatures again, like we did yesterday. advise that right now on your batteries, you have lll amp-hours; and, eventually, we hope to have them up - peaked up to about ll6. one other point, we - we can either read that procedure up again which involves cranking up the telemetry, or, if jack still has it, we can use his notes and - but i have one or two changes to - to make on them. over."
"okay, understand that you'll want us to terminate battery charge for a while, and crank up the cm tm to read out temperatures. and you have a few changes to jack's checklist, and i'll turn the comm over here to jack shortly, as soon as he's finished, and we'll get along with it."
"okay, we'll be standing by for - there's no hurry on it."
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, jim."
"just out of curiosity, vance, what's our distance and velocity now?"
"hey, stand by 1. you're speeding up, i think."
"jim, we have you 101 000 miles out, and your velocity is 5848. starting to speed up."
okay. thank you.
sure enough.
"okay, houston; aquarius."
"go ahead, jack."
"okay, vance. jim said that you want to terminate battery charge on battery a."
"that's affirm, jack. request to - before you terminate it, get the usual readout on voltage and current; and we'd also like a time of termi- nation, and understand you have the termination procedures. is that affirm? 05 02 42 35 cml okay. that's affirm. stand by. let me just make sure i've got everything here before i go off on a tangent."
"okay, jack, and your battery-charge termination procedure remains unchanged, but when we go to power up the cm and look at your tm, we have a couple of additional steps."
"okay. vance, i do have the procedure for stopping the battery charge. and do you want me to copy this procedure now, or do you want me to come back and give you the volt, amps, and time and - after i complete this termination?"
"okay. just - just give us the volts and amps just before you start the termination of the pro- cedure, and understand you say you have the charge - the procedure for taking the charge off. is that affirm?"
that's affirm.
okay. and just give us a hack on the time - -
and you want to - you want to review it at all?
"negative. unless you want me to. i'll tell you what; i could run through it very quickly just to verify that we're getting started off on the correct path here. 05 02 44 3i cmp yes. okay, the first four or five things that i have is panel bat charge to off on panel 3; ac inverter 2, off; panel 5: main bus tie, bat a/c on; panel 250: cb bat a power entry/postlanding, open; panel 275: inverter power 2, main b, open; and then, the - just to go ahead and reverse the position of the switches and circuit breakers that i started out with, and these don't have to be in reverse order. is that charlie?"
"roger, that's - that's charlie. have at it."
"okay, we'll get a volts and amps right now."
okay.
"okay, vance. the volts and amps: 39.4; amps, 1.25."
"okay, jack. we copy that. incidentally - -"
"okay. we're going up to termin - go ahead, vance."
"never mind, jack. i'll bring this up later when you've finished the procedure."
okay. i'm going off the air; i'll put fred-o on. i'm going to stop the battery charge.
okay.
"now, how do you read, vance?"
"hey, loud and clear, fred. understand you've been doing some spring housecleaning, moving stowage around up there."
"boy, you wouldn't believe this lm right now; it's nothing but bags from floor to ceiling."
"hey, that brings up a question. we were wondering where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue? it occurred to us that one possibility was to stow it in the lm, down about where the lmp normally stands, underneath the is - isaer. perhaps you have a better idea. over."
"yes, i do, vance .... would go in the lm, but i thought maybe we ought to stow it where the cdr stands. how's that?"
okay. i can tell that you're just getting - getting that one over because jim just got off the loop.
"yes, he's sleeping. no, that's - that's actually where we normally had been stowing it for normal lm jetts."
"okay, and - hey, we just - we'll record that, al_d figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over in the - where the cdr stands. we have a - a change to this - equipment transfer list that i just read up to jim. why don't you make a note of this one item? forget about the lm - -"
stand by; stand by 1.
okay.
i think jack hauled off the piece of paper with that - all that on it. why don't you hold it until jack gets done doing the battery charge?
okay.
"and, fred, request pcm on lo bit rate, now."
okay. and there was one piece of flight data that we needed that we didn't bring along this time.
what was that?
that's a big book with a lot of just plain old blank pages in it.
"yes, when you - when you get off nominal, why you just need scratch paper, don't you?"
yes.
"okay, vance. i got the stowage list now."
"okay, i gave you two lists - -"
and jack's got - and jack said he's completed - the - secured the battery charge now.
"okay, and we're recording the time that that was complete. you have two lists there, one is lm to cm equipment transfer and the second list is the reverse. request you scratch the last item on the first list, which is returning used bags to the cm. 50 02 52 ii i2vip okay. we didn't have any of those, so that didn't pose any problem anyway."
okay.
"aquarius, houston."
"- okay, vance. aquarius is back on."
"okay, jack. understand you completed securing the battery charge. now if you are ready to copy, jack, i would like to give you the two changes that we have to the powerup for the cm procedure. over."
okay. stand by 1.
okay.
"okay, vance. you say you have some changes in the procedures that i used before to get telemetry and to check out the csm system?"
"yes, that's correct, jack; they're pretty simple. about halfway through the procedure, we have a step on panel 3, which is power ampl, high; we'd like to change that to power ampl, low."
"okay. copy. power ampl, low."
"and the next change, jack, is panel 275. scratch the step ""cb main b, bat b, close - bat bus b, cmos e."""
"okay. you want to delete the step ""cb main b, bat bus b, close."""
"roger. as you know, we're going to do this on lm power, so this reflects that."
okay. real fine.
"okay, and have at it. we - we'd like to have the tm up for about 5 or l0 minutes to look at the data from the cm; look at your temperatures, et cetera. and after that, we'll go back to charging the battery again, and the charge will probably go until around get 126."
okay. do you want the same readouts from me that i gave you before? tape82/9
"that's affirmative, jack. and just to make sure that there is no mistaking the procedure, it starts out for the baekout part: panel 3, power ampl, off; thansponder, off; ac inverter 2, off; then goes to panel 250, et cetera. 05 02 57 07 cml that's - that's the way i read it."
okay.
okay; going back up into the refrigerator.
"hey, i thought it was the bedroom. 05 02 57 22 cml well, it's got a new name now, because it is about 30 degrees cooler."
roger. returning to the deep freeze - -
"- - hey, vance. one thing that i wanted to ask you - is on the stowage list where you have us putting the black-and-white tv camera on top of a-7 in an a ... decontamination bag, i was wondering if it would be possible or if you - there would be any problem in putting it into b-6 along with the two 70-millimeter hasselblad cameras ?"
"jack, i don't think there'll be any problem, if you can get it in, but let us get - work that and get back with you. okay?"
"ail right. i was just thinking. i'm trying to get as much weight as possible down there in that leb. we have no srcs and then our waste tank is - you know - rather depleted. i think it's about down to 40 percent or so. so i'm trying to get as much l over d as i can, and any heavy items we can get down there, i'd be greatly appreciative of you bringing it to our attention."
"okay. we copy that, and we owe you an answer on your last question."
"okay. and i'm in work, going to give you some telemetry."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. we're receiving csm data now."
roger.
"aquarius, houston."
"say again, vance."
"fred, we just lost data on aquar - on jack. would you have him select best omni, please? 05 03 09 2'7 lmp okay. 05 03 11 3_ cc aquarius, houston. 05 03 11 _9 lmp ail right. go ahead."
"fred, we have enough data; recommend that jack take off the tm and power back down again, using his backout procedure. just let us know when he does it."
"okay. 05 03 1 59 cc and, after that, we'll start the battery charge, and we'll have to know when he starts that."
"oksy. he's starting to back out now. just out of curiosity, what - did you all get a readout on what the cabin temp was up there?"
"yes, we're getting 45 to 46 degrees."
now you see why we call it the refrigerator.
"yes, it's kind of a cold winter day up there, isn't it? is it snowing in the command module yet? 05 0_t12 50 lmp is it what, vance?"
is it snowing in there yet?
"oh, snowing. no - no, not quite. the windows are in pretty bad shape, and i guess the service module - we'll be trying to shoot out of the lm window, because every window in the command module is just covered with water droplets. it's going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those cleared off."
roger. understand. pete says to tell you that you'll have some time on the beach in samoa to thaw out after this cold experience.
"hey, that sounds great."
"vance, have you all thought about what cameras you wanted to use? right now, we've got config- ured a hasselblad with a 250, and i've got the lunar-surface number 1 hasselblad, and i've got the lunar surface sequence camera, also, rigged and ready to go. did you have any other druthers about the ..."
"you are referring to the photography of the ser- vice module, is that right?"
that's right.
"we have some procedures in work, and i've seen them, fred. i think pretty soon we'll be shoot- ing them up to you to specify which cameras and settings. but that - that sounds pretty close."
"okay, you might let them know that, if they hadn't thought of it, that we got this lunar-surface sequence camera on board which has its own bat- tery pack setup, and to shoot quite a few pictures with, and that could also be used for this."
"roger. i know we are planning to use that cam- era, among others."
okay.
"okay, houston; aquarius. jack has backed out of powering up the cm, and now he's proceeding to restart battery charge on bat a."
"okay. real good, fred. we copy."
okay. and we are charging battery a now. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription
"roger. charging battery a, fred."
"and, fred, request now first reading of voltage - bat a voltage and charger current. over."
"okay, vance. i can give it to you. i read it right after i started it. bat a voltage was 39.4 and the current had jumped up to 1.4."
"okay. 39.4 and 1.4. thanks, jack."
"okay. how about - you ready for some other readouts, that you wanted there?"
ready to copy.
"okay. bat b, 37.0; pyro a, 37.0; pyro b, 37.0; sps helium pressure, 31100; and nitrogen a and b - just for throwing it in for kicks, 2200 and 2400, respectively; and the injector temperature - stand by- the sun went down. okay. the injector temperature, 5 charlie, 3.9; 5 dog, 3.2; 6 alfa, 3.6; 6 baker, 3.9; 6 charlie, 3.5; 6 dog, 3.4; the battery manifold pressure, 1.4."
"okay. we copy all thai, jack. thank you."
okay.
"you say, you figure you are going to be charging bat a until about 1267"
"roger. about 126:30 is an estimate, jack."
"okay. you figure it will bc fully charged then, huh?"
yes. that's right. we'll have all the batteries up to about 116 amps-hours.
that's good news.
"that's better than 99, huh?"
youtre right.
"how did all our systems look on ..., vance?"
"i didntt hear any complaints, but just a minute; let me make a detailed check. tap_; 8'_12 i_agr; 6 0"
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"jack, it's a general statement. it looks like temperatures have cooled off in the ballpark of 6 to 8 degrees cooler than what they were yester- day. looks like everything is still within tolerance, but we're working up a detailed sheet of temperatures to send up to you, for your inter- est."
okay. that sounds good.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"vance, joe brought up the alinement at ei minus 2 plus 30. were you going to send up or have a discussion about that later on."
"that's correct, jack. we just about have proce- dures in hand detail checklist-type procedures to send to you. in other words, a time line with reference to entry checklist and any changes in the entry checklist. so, if you have a few pages of scratch paper, why, i think we'll have that to you within an hour."
okay. i'll be standing by.
"one other thing, jack - you still with me?"
"yes, go ahead. the stowage people have tried out this black-and-white tv camera into b-6 idea and they say even with the lens off, they can't get it in. so, i still recommend that it be stowed where we had it on the list. that's a-7."
no problem.
"ail right, go ahead."
"jack, request another voltage/readout on bat a and current on bat charger."
"okay, vance. tilevoit 39.3, amp 1.3."
hoger. copy 39.3 and 1.3.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, vance."
"jack, looks like the lm suit release valve has been bumped to auto again; request it - -"
okay.
- - closed. over.
in work.
okay.
how's that right there?
okay. they say it looks good.
okay.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, jack. we need another one of those voltage amps readouts and then maybe we will get off of your back for a little while."
"oh, don't worry about it. i'd like to have you talk with us. volts and amps coming up."
okay.
"okay, vance. volts 39.4, amps 1.25."
okay. eecom's got it duly recorded.
is john aaron on?
"no. gee, i don't know what shift he is on. but he comes in later, i guess. 05 0_ 46 13 cmp actually, all the shifts are mornint_ shift,s lo us. 05 03 46 9 cc say that one af_ain - - 05 ()_ 46 21 cmp the sun is always shining - ail of the shifts are morning shifts to us, because the sun is always shining. 05 03 46 2f_ cc that was a short night. 05 03 46 _9 cmp just for curiosity's sake, are we still holding entry angle at 6.25?"

"okay. but i guess what i was really asking is, if you'd have any violent objections if we filled two drink bags from lm water rather than repres- surizing the surge tank."
okay. stand by on that.
"also, jim is asleep up there and we didn't want to bother him, either."
okay. we understand.

"okay, jack. how's it taste?"
it's - good. it's not quite as gaseous as that in the command module.
"apollo 13, houston - or rather, aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"iiey,jack, we need another reading. volts and amps."
okay. they're coming up.
"vance, you won't believe this, but fred-o says it's 39.4 and 1.245."
"okay. our eecom is recording those numbers. charlie dumas, this time."
oh.
"not changing very fast, is it?"
how far out are we?
"okay. 953 and 6068 on velocity, per fido."
okay.
bill stoval.
thank you.
"houston, aquarius. over"
"go ahead, aquarius."
are the flowers in bloom in houston?
"no, not yet. still must be winter."
suspicions confirmed.
"yes, i doubt if they will be blooming even saturday, when you return."
i concur.
"hey, jim, we have some photo information to pass up to you, discussed this briefly with fred earlier. it's instructions or suggestions for which photos - which cameras and lenses to use during your service module photography. over."
okay. stand by 1.
okay.
go ahead.
"okay. we have three cameras here, two of them to be used for picture taking from the lm, one to be used from the number 5 window of the csm. first, i'll hit the lm cameras. and this camera that i mention now has first priority. it's considered the one to give you the best results. that's the 70-millimeter dc reseau camera, hasselblad, that is, with the 80-millimeter lens, from box a-13. suggest fresh magazine of 3400 black-and-white film."
okay.
okay. suggest either magazine r or magazine s from a-13. transfer all of this to the i_mand recommend the following settings: l_/dc/80/bw 3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th).
and that's all for that one.
"okay, vance. let me see if i have it here. for the lm, want to mse the 70-millimeter dc hasselblad 80-millimeter lens in a-13, using 3400 black-and-white film mags r or s. prepare to take camera to the lm, and the setting would be the lm/dc/80/bw 3400 (f:5.6) at a 250th."
"that's correct. okay. next: the next camera - stand by 1. i've got noise here. okay. the next lm - the next camera for the lm will be the 16-millimeter, and these photos are considered to be priority 3. okay. one, get the 16-millimeter dac and powerpack from a-8. get the 10-millimeter lens, and remove it - remove the 10-millimeter lens, and take the 18-millimeter lens from b-3 and attach it to the camera. and attach the power cable transfer to the lm, set frame rate at 12 frames per second, and the same data line that i gave you before reads this way this time. lm/dac/18/cex, battery (f:8 and 1/250th). okay. now looking at these two cameras in the lm, it's recommended that you use the 16-millimeter for the first 2-1/2 minutes and then switch to the 70-millimeter. that's partly because the frame's been - or the - they've been optimized for closer and longer range. okay. read back, please."
"okay, vance. essentially, what you wanted to use as far as the movie camera in the lm goes, is our lunar sequence camera which is attached to the powerpack. we use the 18-millimeter lens, set it at 12 frames per second ... f:8 at 250th of a second."
roger. f:8 at 250th.
right; f:8 at 250th.
okay. would you believe that we have a correc- tion now to the last camera i gave you? correct that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.
okay. the 18-millimeter to the 75-millimeter lens. okay.
"right. okay. next for the command module pic- tures, it may be a little hard to see the service module from the command module, but if you can see it, it will be through window 5, people down here think. recommend for that the cm 70- millimeter. these photos have priority 2. so this is 70-millimeter el, with - which has the 80-millimeter attached, and this is all in b-3. take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the 250-millimeter lens. and the 250-millimeter lens can be found in u-4. use cex film from a-13. ring sight from a-7, and these pictures will be f:8 at a 250th. and i think probably by now you probably all have - already have these cameras configured, and this may be redun- dant information, but here it is anyway. over."
"okay, vance. you're right. we do have cameras almost configured like you said. for the command module, you think that the el with the 250 lens, cex film, f:8 at a 250th is the best bet, and you're saying now that where you think you'll see it is out window 5? is that it?"
"that's right, jim."
"okay. my procedure, now, after service module jett is going to be to pitch up, in order to try to get the service module into the - to get the center window in view of the service module, which we are going to have somebody there - to photograph. why do you think window 5 will be it?"
"okay. stand by on that one. this is a question of geometry, and i'll get right back. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, regarding window 5, i have a drawing here; and, when you're docked, you have approximately a 60-degree angle between the z-axes of the two spacecraft. it appears that peering out win- dow 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous radar on top of the lm which would, if you pitched, more or less give you a view of the service module. that is, if you pitched, so - from - and i think that this has been run by quite a few folks here; so, offhand, i can't see where any other window would be as good or per- haps even possible."
"okay. i understand. yes, you're right. when we look out window 5, we can see rendezvous radar, and we'll try - we'll try window 5."
"roger. it presumes, though, that there has to be a pitch to be able to see it. you guys sound a lot more rested today. 05 o_ 59 33 cdr well, i just went back and sacked out for an hour or so and didrl't get back up."
very good.
"and, jim, houston. we really are going to get those checklists up to you."
okay.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, it's time for readings on the battery charging again. request the bat a voltage and the charger amps. over."
"okay. stand by, vance."
"houston, aquarius. _j'_ _5 !) 09 cc go ahead, jim. o',05 j9 1_2 (;di okay. w__haw_ no more water in the potable tank. we tried to get some more out a few minutes ago, and there isn't any."
okay. understand you ran out of water in the cm potable tank.
affirmative.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, houston."
"jim, we - you were able to get those voltage - bat a voltage and current readings?"
"oh, yes. fred's - fred's up there now."
"okay. and we're ready to read you the first checklist installment. this will - what we're going to readup is going to be a lm time line, a csm time line, and checklist changes to con- form with these. and right now i have the first installment of the csm time line ready to read up. over."
"okay, jack. i'm going to get - vance, i'm going to get jack on the line for that; and so stand by."
okay. and he'll need a lot of paper.
"okay. volts are 39.5; amps, 1.24. stand by."
okay. we got it.
"aquarius, houston."
"okay, vance. itm on and ready to copy."
"okay, jack. wait 1. we want to get one into the hands of flight and eecom, and it'll take about a minute or 2. sorry to wake you up for this, but take about a minute, and then we'll read it up to you. i'al_: 620 0'_05 _tl 07 cc aquarius, llou';torl."
"okay, vance. go ahead."
"okay, jack. do you have any of that cm water - bagged water, left? 0ver."
"negative. i went up and tried to repressurize the surge tank and get another shot of water, and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay, but there was no water that came out of the water tank."
"y_s. we understand that there isn't any more in the potable tank, but we understood that you had put some water from that tank into bags, and i wondered if any of the bags were left."
negative.
okay.
"okay, jack. ready to copy?"
"okay, vance. ready to copy."
"okay. start at ei minus 6-1/2 hours. you're going to re - get lm pads and csm pads, and i don't know if you want to copy them or not. this is something i can just read off to you. over. without you copying unless you especially want it."
okay.
"okay. lm pad, sm jettison - -"
"okay. go ahead, read which ones wetre going to get."
"okay. i'll read them fast first here so you get a general idea. i_mpad, service module jett attitude, moon viewing attitude, sun viewing attitude, and lm jett attitude. the cm pads are coarse aline angles for lm attitudes during moon and sun sightings, coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat, and cmc angles on entry refsmmat for ia_jett. moon viewing, and entry. okay. that - that's general pad infor- mation. if you want, itll read it slowly so you can copy it all down; otherwise, i'll go ahead. tape 8_1_ l_ag_ 621 05 05 _,5 _0 cml'  g/:t -  wa:; tr'y_ng to copy it as you were reading it,, va.nv_. the lm pada ar(z service module j(:ttl_on atttud(_, moon viewing attitude sun vicwjng attitude, and lm jettison attitude. is that correct?"
"that's correct. okay. i'll read the cm pads now, slowly. coarse aline angles for lm attitudes during moon and sun sightings."
"okay. the next coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat. okay. the next, cmc angles on entry refsmmat for (1) lm jett, (2) moon viewing, (3) entry. okay. i'll stand by until you read that back."
"okay. the csm pads will be coarse aline angles for lm attitudes during moon and sun sightings. coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat. cmc - cmc angles on entry refsmmat for (1) lm jettison, (2) moon viewing, (3) entry."
okay. that's correct.
"okay, jack. going to hold up 1. ail the hordes of people that devised this procedure are going to be coming into the room in a minute, and they'd like to hold up until everybody can listen in."
"get that, jack?"
"okay, vance. we're ready to go."
"okay. we lost you there briefly while you were in an attitude where we eouldntt receive you. jack, we'd like to hold off for about 5 minutes. we have some more people coming in to listen to this, and it took a lot of people to devise this procedure, and a few people have been testing it out, so we_d like to have them all on hs_d while we give you the rest."
okay.
"how's the temperature up there, jack? you guys chopping wood to keep warm?"
"deke, it's about 51, i think, or 50 in the lm, and itts about - i don't know - 45 or little bit less in the command module."
"oh, it's a nice fall day, huh?"
"yes, i tell you, we don't have to worry about chilldown."
"okay, vance. while we're waiting, do you have there also what i can expect ground to uplink me ?"
"we'll have that, jack, but - stand by for that."
okay.
"jack, probably - probably the thing to do is to give you all of the checklist, and it will include things like this. then we'll have a big question and answer session afterwards, if that's okay by you. 05 05 44 2i cmp okay. that sounds good."
"okay, vance. while we're waiting, just for your information, the command module has been stowed per your checklist with the exception of the two hasselblad cameras."
"roger. got that, jack."
and the lm is pretty well stowed with the exception when we have yet to bring in the probe and the drogue.
roger. got that.
"relative to your water situation, jack, we're going to have a pretty good hack on the lm here in the next few hours, and we anticipate letting you fill your own tanks before we transfer over, so you should be in reasonably good shape there."
"okay. we have a number of juice bags all out and ready to go, and we tried to get the water out of the command module about 20 minutes ago and found out that the command module's potable tank was empty. so we have no bags made up now, so we're dependent on lm water, plss water."
"roger. if you feel like trying the plss, that's all excess, and you might want to try that at any time. i'm sure it'll taste like plss but you might as well try it. l'a6e 023"
okay.
"okay, deke. ail the windows in the command module are heavily coated with water right now. so i don't know what kind of pictures we'll get out of them, but i'm going to try and clean them off and do the best i can with the 250-millimeter lens on the hasselblad."
roger. that's why we have the top priority stuff in the lm. we figure you've got a much better chance of getting it through there.
okay.
"aquarius, tiouston."
"are you ready to send it up, vance?"
"jack, before we start reading the procedure, we'd like - we find that bat a is topped off and in great shape. like to switch over and top off bat b some more. give it 2 more hours of charging. have about a seven- or eight-step procedure here to give you, if you want to copy that. we tre switching before we start recording the entry procedures."
okay. stand by and let me get out my other checklist.
"okay, vance. ready to copy."
"okay. panel 3: switch battery charge to off. panel 5; main bus tie bat a/c to bat a/c; cb battery charger, bat a charge to open; cb battery charger, bat b charge, close. next, panel 250; cb bat b power entry/postlanding to close. panel 5; main bus tie, bat b/c, off. panel 3; battery charge to b. advise; well, stand by. jack, advise that we have a baekout procedure for this, but we'll read that up to you later, in about 2 hours. and, also, that this procedure is a delta to your - the first battery charging procedure that we gave you. in other words, itts a delta from where you are right now. 05 o_ 57 lo cml okay. this _s the procedure for charging bat 2aker. panel 3; bat charge, off; panel 5; main bus tie, bat a/c to a/c; cb bat charger, bat a charge, open; cb bat charger, bat b charge, close. panel 250; cb bat b power entry and postlanding, close. panel 5; main bus tie, bat b/c, to off; panel 3; bat charge to b. this is a delta for the first battery charging procedure; you'll give me the backout procedure in a couple hours."
that's affirm.
"okay. i'll put it in work right now, then come back and stand by to copy the rest of - well, i - not the rest - everything."
everything is right.
youtd never believe how much this procedurets been massaged in the last day.
"okay, vance. i put bat baker on charge; i don't think it quite had stabilized. it was reading 1.1 amps, 39.6 volts when i left up there."
okay. we got that.
okay. i guess now is as good a time to start as any.
"just a second, jack."
"aquarius, houston."
"okay, vance. you're kind of weak, but readable."
"jack, we're going to need readings on the bat volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 min- utes for a while, so is there somebody else that can be reading them out while you're copying? over."
"yes. jim will take a run up there. fred-o is sleeping right now. we're trying to get some sleep here, and jim'll run up and take a look at voltage and current whenever you call."
okay. _age 025
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"vance, we've got to realize that we've got to establish a work-rest cycle up here, so we just can't wait around here to just read procedures all the time up to the burn. wetve got to get them up here, look at them, and then we've got to get the people to sleep. so take that into consideration when you get ready to send up the pads."
"i know, jim. we're very conscious of that. we -we should be ready to go in about 5 minutes. that's all i can say. stand by."
okay.
"aquarius, houston."
"okay, vance. we're ready to go."
okay. we need a - sorry (laughter). we need a readout. volts and amps.
okay. in work.
"and, might as well bring the comm up to a higher fidelity for this long period of checklist reading. that requires, panel 16: cb primary s-band power amp, closed."
"okay, primary s-band power amp closed now. how do you read?"
"okay. and next step, panel 12: s-band function to voice and ranging function to hanging."
"okay, vance. the s-band function is at voice and the ranging switch was at ranging."
"okay. that makes it so we can hear you better, jack."
"okay. can we - since the first part of it, you're just going to read and i_m going to copy and we're going to have a question and answer period later, can we get started? l_age 626 0', 0(,  _ 5;' (jc okay. l'r'ocr:4ure's coming back in again. multi- copies l'or distribution. and ken's back. he's a local expert on this now, so we'll turn you over to him and he'll read it off."
"okay. stand by. i'll give you volts and amps. okay. the voltage is 39.1; amps, 1.75."
okay.
"hello, aquarius; houston. how do you read?"
"okay. very good, ken."
"okay. let me take it from the top here. just - there might be some overlap, but to make sure we're all on the same signal. we're starting off with a set of time line procedures that are going to give us - end up with the normal entry checklist. there will be some checklist changes into the book, but the bulk of what i have for you is the time line stuff. and it starts at 6 hours and 30 minutes prior to ei and assumes that we're getting im power to main b in the command module. i think you already have the numbers for the lm pads and the comand module pads; i mean the types of pads we'll be giving you. and if you have a question on what they'll be doing or what they're for, i can go over those now or when we get through."
"okay. yes, i'll make a little note there, and we'll discuss it when we get everything copied, huh?"
"ail right. and the first item, then, after you get ready to start this checklist, is to install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow ordeal. on panel 8, we want to turn the floodlights to fixed."
"okay. wait a minute. you're going too fast, here."
"okay. i'll tell you. i'll go line at a time and wait for your verification before i go on to the next one. i have panel 8, floodlights, fixed, 05 06 6 j_ cc okay. install lioh cariistcrs, stow ordeal,, i,',()()1),1(',1it:',, i,'ixj,'.l). 05 0, 6 ;12 cc okay. that's the panel 8 floodlights. now we're going to take panel 5 and put the floodlight rheostat to flood and the leb, that's panel 100, floodlights are also going to fixed. and the purpose of this is to balance up buses a and b."
"okay. panel 5; floodlights; you want the rheo- stat on. panel 100, floodlights; you want fixed."
"that's affirmative. okay. on panel 8: circuit breakers ns, main a and main b, that's two, open. 05 06 17 47 c_ip okay. panel 8: _4s main a and main b, open."

"and, jack, can you give us a readout on bat b and the charger current?"
"okay, ken. that was the primary and secondary h20 control valves to auto on 382."
"that's affirmative, and did you copy about the readout on the battery and charger?"
yes. jim's on his way up.
"okay. thank you. all right, the next little step after your water control valves is to per- form the csm rcs preheat. we'll do that on page e/l-5, steps 35 and 37."
"okay, ken. we're having a problem with the comm. you read now?"
"yes, sir. loud and clear."

"okay. after that, lock both rotation hand con- trollers."
"that's affirm. on panel 8: sequential, pyro arm, two to arm. (11511636 _7 cmp okay. panel 8: set fyro arm, two, to arm. do i get a msfn go for that? 05 06 36 143 cc that's negative, jack. we haven't powered up any of the downlink a this time. you'll be doing this and the command module rcs pressuri- zation both by yourself."
okay.
"okay. now, the next event is going to be the separation of the service module, and these are some lm steps, but so that you will know what is going on, i'll read them to you. the lm will do a lm plus-x of one-half foot per second. then you'll be hitting the cm sm sep on and up, on their command. as soon as we are free of the service module, the lm will do another _4 minus-x for 0.5 feet per second. this is called the push-pull maneuver. i think it was described this afternoon."
"yes, ken. it was, i heard about it."
"okay. i just wanted you to know that's the sequence you're in. okay. at the completion of that, we go back to panel 8, and it's sequential, pyro ap_4,both of them, to safe."
"okay. panel 8: seq pyro arm, two, to safe. ()b06 j_ '28 cc okay. and 'olowing thls, we take sequential, i,o(',ic, hw_, to off. 05 06 $8 )i_ cml' (ilay. i,_jlct,wo, to off."
"i'm sorry, jack. i'1 have to ask you to repeat that."
"okay. panel 8: seq logic, two, to off. are they on now, ken? i don't remember turning them - i guess that's part of one of the other sequences, huh? that we turned them on?"
"that's affirm. the reason we're turning the logic off, jack, is a power savings. so we'll be turning them off, _md i'll ge getting them back on when we go to get off of the lm; and then turn them back off, then we'll be turning them on prior to entry. just so you know what's coming."
"okay, real fine."
"okay. then following this, the lm will pitch up to acquire the moon - excuse me, they're going to pitch up and acquire lhe service module and photo- graph, and they'll be using the aca for rotations from now on. and you may see the lm out of window number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire it."
"okay. the lm pitches up, acquires the service module and photographs it, and i should expect to find - might possibly see the service mod_le out of window 5."
"that's affirmative. ()kay, now we're down to ei minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the i2 starts a maneuver to what we call the moon-view attitude. this maneuver is designed to place the command module optics pointing with zero zero at the moon, and it will be flown to on the lm ball angle."
"okay, the lm maneuvers to the moon-viewing atti- tude which would place the moon in the center of the command module optics with them at zero zero."
"that's affirmative. okay, now we're going to panel 5, and it's circuit breaker g&n, computer, main b, closed. 05 06 4.21 cmp okay. panel 5: cb g&n, computer, main b, closed. 05 ()641 '55 cc that's affirmative. now you're _oing. to come up with a 37 enter 06 enter most likely on t_:,: eoynt_ut;r.axlewhat w_ w_mt to do is to i_ut the computer to ::taadby; if'yo_j_ome up with a 37 06, you' have to do an enter in order to get the code 62. if fit'sgot 62 on it, you can do a proceed until the dsky blanks. you might remember that the ac _s still off at this time so you won't be getting the standby status light, and your cue that the computer is indeed in standby is when the dsky goes blank. 05 06 42 6 cmp okay. you're saying that i will probably get a program 06 with a verb 37 enter flashing. 05 06 42 ?7 cc i expect that you - - 05 06 42 2it cmp enter 06."
i expect you are - -
"say again, ken."
"yes. we think that you're going to come up with a 37 06 already ,nthe dsky. if you do, do an enter and that should take you to the code 00062, which is the request for standby. and when you get that, hit proceed until the dsky blanks. if you come up with something else, that's where we want to end up anyhow. with e_ther, when you get the code 62 when it comes up, just do a proceed on it."
"okay. is there anything else i could get? 05 06 4'_/2 cc i don't believe so, jack. that's one that when you get to that step, if you do get something else, we will be standing by to see that you see. the whole scheme is to go to standby."
will you be getting i_ on downlink?
"no, sir. we don't have that powered up yet."
"okay. i'll yell to j_m, and jim will give you a call."

"()kay. set it from th_, chc, huh?"
"that's affirm. okay. now, we are getting ready to start the alinement sequence, and are you familiar with the general sequence of events we're going to use, jack?"
"how do you mean? we are going to make an aline- ment on the ,'looannd on the sun; other than that - i didn't get any - i wasn't on the headset when the general information was passed up, so if there was any more than that, i didn't get it.

"the first thing we arc going to do is to coarse aline the platform an6 get it inertial_ based on the refsb94at that you have in the present slot inside the cmc. we'll then go - and do a p52, option h - correction, option 1."
"okay - that's after the lm gets established at the attitude. jim says i'm here at the moon- viewing attitude, i do a verb 41 noun 20 to the set of angles that you're going to give me in the pad."
that's affirmative - -
and then i enter the p52.
that's correct.
"okay. _'heni enter the p52 and that's an option 3, right?"
"the p52 will be done as an option 1. the only reason you have the other refsmmat inside tho computer is that in order to set the refsmmat flag, you need some r_lative orientation."
"okay. i see. i do a p52 option 1, and when do i set the refsmmat flag and the drift flag?"
that will be before entering p52. i am going to give you this procedure in detail. 05 07 04 38 cml okay. ali right. let's go at it. maybe it'll all fall out and i won't have any questions. go ahead.
okay. i'm ready to start reading again. we start with a verb 41 noun 20.
"okay. when the lm is in the moon-viewing attitude, i do a verb 41 noun 20, enter."
"that's right. and you'll put in the attitudes that you'll get from one of the pads, and this will be for the coarse aline angles when the lm pal_c643 is at th_ moon-via_wing attitude. then when they're all ,_quared away, i tell you they have the right attitude; we then pick up again with a verb 40 noun 20, enter."
"okay. verb 40 noun 20, enter when moon is - the lm is satisfied that they're at the moon- viewing attitude."
"that's correct. now we're going to set the refsmmat and drift flags according to the g&c checklist, page g/7-1, steps 3 and 4."
"okay. set the refsmmat flag for g&c 7-1, steps 3 and 4."
"that's correct. now verb 37, enter; 52, enter; option 1."
"verb 37, enter; 52, enter; option 1."
that's correct. and _e'll do the coarse aline.
okay. perform the coarse aline function.
"okay. now when it gets back to the mark rou- tines, we want to take a mark on the moon."
okay. mark on the moon with the crosshairs in the center. is that right?
"that's affirmative. okay. when that's complete, the lm will maneuver to the sun-viewing angle for attitude. and when they get there, you take a mark on the sun using the sun filter and the telescope; and, again, we're marking on the center."
"okay. now, let me ask you a question. is the first mark on the moon made with the - are all these made with the telescope and not the sextant?"
"if - i'm not sure right offhand what the angular size of the moon is, jack. if you can get it in the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but you may have to go into the telescope in order to define the center. either one's acceptable. _)9 07 08 04 cmp okay. i1'  can define the center through thc soxtatlt, do it that way. anti if f can 't, usc thc telescope_."
_lat's affirmed. we know you're going to usc the telescope on the sun.
okay. you ready to press on?
i'm ready.
okay. just reminded we owe somebody a bat b voltage.
"okay, another volts ard amps coming up."
"ail right. thank you. and this left us in p52 with two marks, and we'll go ahead and torque the noun 93s."
"okay .... torque the noun 93s, after the two marks."
"okay. so that gives us a good platform. now the lm will maneuver to the jettison attitude, and the only thing of significance here is that you want to watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform."
okay. the lm maneuvers to the jettison attitude and i just monitor the maneuver and yell at jim if he gets near a gimbal lock.
"that's affirmed. okay, and then the lm will _ to a max deadband attitude hold in the jettiscn attitude. 05 07 10 04 cml okay. _qaelm goes to max deadband attitude hold."
"okay. now we're ready to go back to work. 5%1e next thing we'll do is to continue to powerup procedures. do you have any further questions on that alinement, jack?"
no. no. i think - i think it's all self- explanatory now.
"okay. the one thing that everybody wou2d like for you to understand is we certainly don't insist orlii:;rltfh__:m(_ori:j_ldthe earth_ if you find you haw; good stars, why use them. itowever, this airl_mont is mor_: than adequate te give us a good guided entry."
"okay. if i get a set of good stars, do i start right out to a basic p51 and a p52 option 17"
that's affirmative.
okay.
"okay. now, we're ready to go to work on panel 275. and it starts with a circuit breaker main a - - 05 07 11 01 c_p wait - wait just a minute. wait just a minute. i owe you some volts _md amps."
"okay. ail right. 05 07 tl 09 cmp okay. volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25."
"okay. i thought mayb(, your meter was stuck before."
no (laughter).
"all right. you ready to go back to 275? have a circuit breaker main a, bat bus a, closed."
"cb main a, bat bus a, closed."
"that's correct. and circuit breaker main b, bat c, closed."
"cb main baker, bat charlie, closed."
"okay. that's correct. now we're up to ei minus 1 plus 30. and at this time, we're going to proceed with the closeout and hatch installa- tion."
okay. closeout and hatch installation at ei minus 01:30.
"that's right, jack, and we're going to close the im hatch, and we'll make the dump valve in the lm hatch closed. tape 85/6"
"understa_ld you're going to close tiledump valw, now on the 34hatch, right?"
that's correct.
okay. this is a change from what we had under- stood previously.
that's correct.
"i'm - personally, i'm happy to see it, but that's good."
"okay. that's one vote on your side. ()kay; and we're going to go ahead and do the - use the decal to perform the hatch installation, and we'll start on the hatch integrity check."
"okay. per the decal, perform the hatch installa- tion smd start on the hatch integrity check."
that's correct.
"okay, ken. one thing i think that - i don't know whether anybody --the decal don't take into account the fact that we still have the umbili- eals connected. at what point in time should they be removed?"
"okay, jack. that doesn't matter. we're going to be separating the tunnel upstream of those umbilicals, and you can leave them right there."
"okay. does it make _y difference if we disengage - the i_m- we have pulled the circuit breakers i_mpower-1 aad -2, so if we choose to disconnect these umbilicals, there's no harm, right?"
"that's right. no sweat. john aaron's just saying that they may he hot. he's checking on it, so how about hold?ng a decision on that and let me come back to you?"
okay.
"okay. and let me tell you what we're going to do since we told you a different story this afternoon on this tunnel. we're actually going to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with about 1-1/2 to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel. and this will give us a delta-p of 3. so we'12 do our hatch int_grjty check r,tthe same time we're venting the tu31nel down."
okay. it sounds good.
okay. now let me giw_ you some plumbing switches here. let's take the surge tank oxygen valve to on.
surge tank 02 to on.
"ail right. take the main regs, two, open."
"main regs, two, to open."

"that's correct. on p_mel 4: primary ecs glycol pumps, one, to ac 1."
"primary ecs glycol pumps to 1, ac1. tape 8_/18"
"that's correct. okay, then we'll finish going back to the tunnel vent, and verify the lm/cm delta-p and make sure it's been holding pres- sure. and we'll come back again and rehash all of the hatch integrity check and tunnel vent procedures with you. the next thing i want to read off is the ei minus 1 plus 20. we'll go to panel 7: _magnumber 1 power to warm up."
bmag number 1 power to warm up.
"that's correct. then at ei minus 1 plus 10, we'll perform scs powerup per checklist, page g/2-4."

"yes, just something that's comfortable for you."
okay.
"all right, after we'w? done that, we want to get panel 8, sequential, pyro arm, two of them, on."
okay. i get a go fron msfn for this?
"okay, john says we can watch it."
okay.
"all right; the next thing is csm/lm final sep, two of them, on, up."

"okay. seq pyro arm, two, to safe."
"that's correct, and go back to po0."
okay. go to po0. 05 07 24 4_ cc all right. and now it's time to configure for single ring.
okay. configure for single ring rcs.
"that's right, and since you're still _a hour from ei, i guess it wouldn't hurt to use minimum impulse or something like that rather than the dap, at least not until you get closer down. we'll have the dap loads for you later."
...- - tape85/2o pa_e 650
"okay. and as soon as you've gotten yourself all set up w_th a good control mode, you want to maneuver lo the entry attitude. 05 07 25 )_5 cmp maneuver to entry attitude per the pad."
"that's correct. and we show ei minus 55, which really means when you get to the entry attitude, we have a sexta_t star check for you. and that will be on the pad."
(kay. perform a sextmlt star check.
"okay. and i want to re,mind you to park the optics at 90 degrees of shaft."
"okay. say again why, ken. i didn't understand that."
"okay, this is just a precaution, jack. if we park the optics with a 90-degree shaft angle, that will line up the slit's so it gives you the best airflow over that part of the heat shield and avoids a hot spot. if you don't remember it, i don't think it makes much difference. it's just good procedure."
okay.
"okay. and after you've got it parked wherever you want it, well, turr. the optics power off and stow the optics."
"(kay. optics power, off; stow the optics."
"okay, that's good, okay. the next thing we'll do is to initialize the ems and that's on entry checklist page 2-1, step number 2."
"okay, perform ems initialization per entry checklist page 2-1, step 2."
"okay, that's correct. now we're coming up on ei minus _5 minutes, and we'll give you an entry pad and a final state vector."
"okay, at minus 45, entry pad and final state vector from msfn."
"okay. now we're going to perform what we call the moon check. rather than go into detail, if pal_:65 i .y_,l_ al r',':,dy i'.m_w wftut.. '..,'_""r',' _jirll_, ,t.j:;t., :;:j.y ::_._; ol,h(,r'w:,_*, i'll d,,:;(:rib,: t,h(. ti:;,, o' t,h_; &jon- attitmd_, :;i,. 0_ 07 28 38 cmp maybe you better describe it."
"okay, jack. you remember everybody in the past has commented on seeini_ moonset just a couple minutes prior to ei, and your horizon will prob- ably be dark at the time that you get there; you're having an early morning entry; and coming in from the west, you'll still be looking at a dark horizon. so, just as a backup technique, just like you would track the horizon, we're going to give you an attitude which will be on the pad so that you can look directly at the moon. this is an inertial attitude; it won't be changing, and you'll put the 36-degree window line on the moon, and hen just sit there and watch it. and just pr or to ei, the earth will come up and occult it, and you will then have a good horizon check. and i have some times, and i'll give you that later. and if you just look at this thing now, at vhat point you c_l set the gdc or whatever you desire. and you will have a known attitude reference. it's just like a horizon check."
"okay, i maneuver to the moon check attitude; at which time i put the 36 window line on the moon, and just prior to ei, the earth will occult the moon."
that's correct. and that corresponds to the same inertial attitude that you'd have on the back of your entry card where it shows the hori- zon attitude several minutes prior to ei; it's the same thing.
"yes, that's that one at 17 minutes prior. okay."
"okay, and we're just getting it in a little closer. okay, the _xt item on the check - checklist here is an ei minus 40; we're going to panel 7, and it's _ag number 2 power to warm up."
"okay, panel 7: b_iagnumber 2 power to warm up."
"that's correct. now, i'd like to verify the surge tank and repress packages are on. ()507 '_1iz cml' v_._rifysurge tank and repress package are on. 05 0'( %1 16 cc that's correct. on panel 5: circuit brewer environmental - contro!, systa_; waste water/ urine dump heater, two of them, closed."
"panel 5: cb ecs, wast_j h20/urine dump heaters, two, to close."
that's correct. suit compressor number 2 to off.
suit compressor 2 to off.
"that's right, jack, and what this - what we're planning to do in order to conserve power is we're going to run the suit compressor from a_ hour to this point at minus 40. and we'll be watching the pc02; if nhat thing's working, we'll turn it off at the earliest time that we have a good cabin, and then we'll just leave iv off. and in the event that the pco2 gage isn't working properly or something like that, well, we'll just go ahead and run it loc this time frame."
"(kay, that sounds good."
"ail right. row we're at ei minus 30. sequen- tial, logic, that's two of them, to on, up."
"ei minus 30; seq, logic, two, on."
"okay, in panel 7: the bmag number 2 power to on."
"okay, we - you only gave that 10 minutes for the warmup, huh?"
that's okay.
okay.
"ail right, and fdai power to both."
fdai power to both.
okay. and we want to activate the primary evaporator.
"okay, activate the primary evaporator. ail this time, ken, what've we been getting our cooling? right now, i think we have the radiators at pull to bypass. f"
"that's correct. we started out that way, and we tinned the glycol pump:_ on, and we're just cir- culatinf_ it internally. and we're counting on the command module being a heat sink; it's pretty cold soaked, and it looks like this is good enough. you got some relatively low heat loads - - 05 07 34 20 cml okay."
"- - and we'll keep watching the temps, and if we need it, why we'll start the evaporator early."
"okay, that sounds good."
do you believe it's cold up there?
"yes, and we used to call the command module the bedroom and it's now the refrigerator."
"okay, just don't call it the reefer. okay. at about ei minus 19, we get back into the standard entry checklist on page?2-2, where it starts with p61."
"okay, at ei minus 19, we get back into the entry checklist at page 2-2, where we start entering p61."
"okay, jack. now that's the - those are the time-line notes i had for you. i hate to tell you this, but i also have a couple of corrections to make to the entry checklist. they aren't cor- rections, they just are pieces of the entry checklist which will correspond to what i've written - already read to you. and i'm ready to to on that whenever you are. and vance tells me you can get into the descent water for drinking now."
"we can get into the descent water for _inking, huh?"
yes.
sounds good.
"hey, go to it."
"jim would like to know whether the descent water will be good until lm jettison? tap_: 85/2)_ pagr_654 05 ()'( _(, i'_ (ii_ ok:ly, ,l_ud'.. i,_,og:: l il'_' wr,'r'l. i_,r/_ t,c, l_,00rj th(' a:m_'it, t,:_.uks at 2_1:30. arid it looks ljk_ - -"
"okay, understand. we are going - -"
- - you have plenty of water. i'm sorry we cut each other out; say again.
"okay, yes. i was going to say, understand we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30."
"that's right; based on the current rate, that's what they predict and you can go ahead and drink the water. no sweat."
"okay, real fine. and i've got the entr_r check- list out and i'm ready to copy; just give me the page."
"okay. jack, you're starting to sound l_ke an lmp."
i think i'm probably the only cmp that's ever witnessed an - a lm burn from inside the lm in - in space flight.
"(laughter) i hope it stays that way. okay, jack, we're starting or_page 1-1."
go ahead.
"okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9, we're just going to strike out the ""activate vhf for comm checks,"" and line 10, ""verify the dse."" we're going to leave the dse off, and that's to save power, as is the vhf activation."
okay.
"okay, on page 1-2. at minus 2 hours, there's a title ""logic sequence"" check; and we're deleting that entire sequence; that's included in what i read up to you."
"okay, delete the logic sequence check at minus 2 hours there."
"that's correct. and delete lines 23, 24, and 25. that means a maneuver to supercirc entry attitude. everything below that is deleted."
okay. delete lines 23 through 28.
"that's correct. you got ahead of me. all right, on line 29 on page 1-3, we're going to put in a time of minus 00:55. that's the time we gave you for the boresight check."
okay - -
"that's your sextant check, really."
got that.
"okay, on the top of page 1-4; where it said ""l hour and 15 minutes"" next to line 32, we're going to change that to ""minus 2 hours and 30 minutes."""
"okay, minus 02:30 opposite item 32."
"okay, down at the bottom of the ems entry check right there where we are, the bottom line now reads, ""ems mode to standby."" well, just above that - like to remind you to put a remark, ""do not initialize the range to go."" this is because you're going to come into the ems entry check, you're going to run through all these things; then we're going to remove power from the _is. and just didn't want you to get ahead of yourself and initialize the entry parameters, because you'll lose them when we power up."
okay.
"and, after we go ems mode to standby, like for you to add ""circuit breaker t_s, two, to open."""
"okay, ""cb ems, two, to open."""
"that's correct. and we want to delete this ""set up camera"" that's listed on the bottom of the page. we're deleting that for power reasons. that's line 33 alfa."
"okay, we're way ahead of you. we already got it stowed."
"okay. on the top of the next page where it says ""secondary water evap,"" just keep in mind we don't plan to use the secondary evaporators un- less the primary fails. on line 35 on page 1-5, j'alt_ 656 r*'xt, l,o ""c(_rjm:trjdmodbll! ,_(,':; ,r-_.h,,:k,_ti d,_',_*ti.rri_: is now ""mif_us 06:0."""
"okay, ""minus 06:30,"" gad the voltage re:_ding 3.9 still is good, right? 05 07 hi 21 cc okay, very good. undec ""final stowage,"" the first thing that's lis,;ed on line 36, page 1-5, is ""optics."" and if you want to get started on your stowage, we'd like to leave the optics out, because we'll have the star check coming up quite a bit after this. the rest of that stuff can be taken care of at your convenience."
okay.
"ali right, still on pace 1-5, line 37; the time is now ""minus 06:10."""
got that.
"okay, and this is one time it looks like we might actually do the preheat, so that's the reason we want to make sure that we know that not more than 20 minutes of time on the preheat. we may not be able to watch it at that time because you aren't powered up."
okay. either 20 minutes or until 3.9 volts dc.
"that's correct, jack. and now let's go to page 1-6. and about one-third of the w_y down, it shows ""panel 275 cb main a, bat c, closed,"" we want to strike off '_hatline, the next two lines, and we're going to strike out ""main a, bat c, closed; main b, bat c, closed; and dc indicator, main b."""
"okay. after that step on panel 275, strike out ""cb main a, bat c; cb main b, bat c; and dc indicators to main b."""
"that's correct. now reader panel 8, it ells you to ""close all circuit breakers except,"" and i have four additions. the first one is cb service module rcs heaters, quad charlie, main b, open."
"service module rcs heaters, quad charlie, main baker, open. ta_ 85/27 pa_'_c65'( i/, i)'( 4 _ ',u cc ()p,_ly. ahd i,h_ '._arjr: thir_l; for ;',j!:i_vice moi)ui,e rc_,; iiea'i'er:;, qiiad dejta, main a, open."

"that's correct. and clrcuit breaker ems, that's two of them, open."
"cb ems, two, to open."
"ail right. and the last is the circuit breakers for sps gaging, four of them, open."
"sps gaging, four to open."
okay. and how about our readout on the battery and that charger?
"okay, bat's at volts and amps."
"that's affirmed. and let's go back to page 1-6, line 41. let's put in a time ""minus 04:40."""
minus 04:40.
"that's correct. on page 2-1, line number 2, put in a time of ""minus 55 minutes."""
"okay, minus 55 minutes."
"okay. and the first thing you want to do under ""ems initialization,"" is circuit breakers ems, that's two of them, to close."
"okay. cb ems, two, to close."
"that's correct. ail right. line 4 or step 4, where it shows ""cm rcs check."" that occurs at minus 04:30."
okay. minus 04:30.
"ail right. under ""cm rcs checks,"" the fourth line down says ""manual attitude, three, to mini- mum impulse."" we'll have to use ""accel command"" and the reason for that, jack, is we don't have the sps powered up so there's no minimum impulse generator. ta_' _5/'_'_1"
"okay. manual attitude, three, to accel command."
"that's correct. and on the same page 2-1, strike out the last three lin_s, starting with ""rcs transfer to service modmle."""
right. the last three lines are scratched out. we ain't got one of those things.
"that's correct. okay, let's flip to page 2-2 and strike out the first two lines."
"okay. now wait a second. i need to give you volts and amps, ken. 05 07 4'14 cc all right. go ahead."
"okay. it's 39.6, 1.12."
"sounds like you're getting there. okay. i believe we scratched out the first two lines on 2-2. now, we're - right below that, it says ""separation checklist."" so we're going to just delete that whole thing; it's included in the notes i gave you."
okay. it's included in the notations.
"all right. line number 7. it says ""maneuver to horizon check attitude."" we're going to call this the ""moon-check attitude"" and this is the one we discussed, jack. the angle of 265 is not correct. i'll have one of those for you first thing in the morning."
okay.
"okay. and at the bottom of the page, step number 1. that will be at ei minus 19 minutes, and we're off and running through a normal sequence of events."
"okay. that sounds good. ken, i guess if you've read this thing - is it a comfortable time line? any areas where you had problems with?"
"jack, it is very comfortable. we've run it several times now and, in fact, it's being run right now, again. and we've run it both here at houston and at the cape. the only place where you might find that you need to stay ahead of tam: 85/_9 i'a_?.. 659 things is during the platform-alinement period, when you're getting ready to close out the lm and then once you get into the command module and jettison the lm, why you're back on a very com- fortable time. and, of course, we'll be watching and anything we can do, like keeping track of time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go along."
"hey, that would be good - that would be good, ken."
"okay. let me emphasize, jack, that 2-1/2 hours is the earliest time we can start in on that powerup stuff. everything else you can do the way you normally would, where you get as far ahead of the game as you can. but the 2-1/2- hour time is based on saving command module con- sumables. and if you do that, why we're fat; we've got plenty of time to give you some fans on the water even. so that's the one point you don't want to start early on. i do have a couple of more lines to run through on the entry checklist and two pages in the g&c. and i think that will clean us up."
"okay, ken. and g&c checklist now?"
let me finish a couple more things in the entry book. you still got that?
yes. go ahead.
"okay. on - these are just cleanup items, jack. on page 2-3, it lists now you separate, from the cm/sm sep and all that, so, obviously, if we're on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted. and that gets deleted all the way over onto page 2-4, up to the line where it says ""15 min- utes.'' and at that point, we pick back up and everything. from 15 minutes down is valid."
"okay. delete item 5 down to the point where it says ""minus 15 minutes."""
"that's correct, jack. okay, on page 2-5. the top line where we had ""horizon cheek,"" that's now the ""moonset check"" and the time is approxi- mately 57:37. and that's minus 02:23. and that angle that's listed in the book there - 177 - that's really a horizon time at 2 minutes; we'll 'l'apc_l',/_0 have you - can look that up on the back of yo_n_ entry cue card, and i'll look that number up again for you tonight."
okay.
"okay. another thing is to remember when we begin blackout, which is arc,md 05g, and you can write this in your checklist wherever it's convenient; once we've lost comm, we're going to go ahead and power down the sce power off and the pmp power off. and we just want to do that after you lose comm, which comes up around ei. any time after that, go ahead and secare the pmp and the sce power."
"okay. when comm is lo'st, sce power off, pmp power off. 05 07 52 147 cc that's correct, jack, and that completes the entry checklist. let's look at the g&c book."
okay. ready to copy.
okay. let's go to page 2-1.
okay. go ahead.
"okay, jack. the second line under ""imu powerup"" says ""fdai power to both,"" and we're going to make that a ""1."" the reason we're doing that is, again, to conserve power. there's no reason to drive the second fdai before we get that information to put on it."
"okay. ""fdai power to 1."""
ail right. that's correct. on page 2-2. 05 07 54 06 cml go ahead.
"okay. under cmc powerup, line - or step 2 says ""flashing 3700, enter."" the time we're going to use this, jack, is going to be when you've just brought the computer up and it has a state vector in it that's way back many, many hours ago. so we want to do a verb 96, enter to stop the inte- gration to keep it from just sitting there ambling along. and when the ground gives you a new state vector, why then we can go through po0 and we'll be back in business. pag_ 6_1 ij', ()' 5)1 1_ cml' ok,a.y.

okay.
ail right. and the last one i have for you is on page 2-4.
okay. go ahead.
"okay. under the scs powerup, the first line says ""auto rcs select, 16, to off."" okay. you can just delete that part. on the fifth line, it says ""circuit breaker scs logic power,"" that's really ""logic bus, four of them, to closed."" the delta-v cg is not important since we are not burning the engine. the ""signal conditioner/ driver bias power"" lists ""two to ac 1."" we are going to make that just one of them; make it ""signal condition/driver bias power, one, to ac 1."" the ""bmag power,"" which is the third line from the bottom, says ""bmag power, two, on;"" we are going to make that just one. we'll bring up number 1, and we'll make ""fdai power, num- ber 1"" and the last line ""auto rcs select, 16, enable,"" you can strike that off and reslace it with ""bmag mode, three of them, to rate 1."" you want to try reading that back?"
"okay. delete ""auto rcs select, 16, off."" change ""cb logic power"" to ""logic thrust power - cbs cs logic thrust, four, to closed."" delete ""delta-v cg,"" coming down here ""signal conditioner/driver bias power, one, ac 1; bmag power, 1, to on,"" and it's the number 1 t_mag.

okay. i think we will.
"ail right, sir. okay, jack, and they'd like us to stand by just a second."
"jack, would you get the battery charger, off, please. and we'll send you - -"
okay.
- - the rest of that procedure later.
"you mean there's more? okay, in work. battery charger is going off."
right.
"okay, vance. okay - i don't think you've given me the backout procedure, have you, for the battery chargers?"
"that's negative. wait. ail we want to do, jack, is say battery charge off at the moment. we'll complete that procedure as soon as you are through with ken completely."
"_ay, vance. the battery charger's off, and i'm ready to continue with ken."
"okay, jack. and we'll get the backout to you after that."
"okay, jack. it looks like we've closed up the loose ends here. amazingly enough, out of all that stuff, it looks like we only generated one question on the floor, and we'll research that one. we'll even let you guess what it might have been. if you have any questions, after you mull it over, why, we're always available. just ask us what you're thinking about."
"okay. that's what we're going to do. we're going to wait until the lm people get theirs, and then we're going to discuss it and coordinate things here, and make sure that - that we don't have any interface problems. and, if we have _uly more questions, we'll be coming back at you."
"okay. we did run the thing integrated, so we think we've got all the little surprises ironed out for you."
i hope so because tomorrow is examination time.
roger.
"ken, this is jim."
"yes, sir."
"appreciate the work you've done, and jack says that it's going to be nard to beat his record about saving sm rcs fuel all the way there and back."

"okay. you ought to have it now, jack."
"okay. you're coming through good now, fred. i've got three deltas to the checklist. thet're minor changes. i'd like to pass them along now. one of them is to the csm checklist. so if you'll pick that up, i'll give it to you. 05 12 31 25 ly_ okay. which one?"
okay. stand by 1.
is it the one jack wrote them all in? the big long readout? he also wrote something in the g&n book.
"it's in the big, long one he wrote out at about ei minus 02:30. ems entry check. paga 690"
okay. he's coming back down with it.
"meanwhile, fred, i've got two for you on the lm prep checklist."
okay. jack's here now. i'll hand it to him.
"okay, houston; aquarius."
"hello, aquarius. i've got a couple of changes for you on your csm checklist."
okay. stand by 1.
"okay. go ahead. 05 12 31_00 cc okay, jack. the time line between ei minus 02:30 and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really going to have to hustle, and we've decided to delete the ems entry check at minus 02:30. that'll give you a little more time in there. what we've decided to do with it is wait until after ei minus 1, just before you initialize the ems. if you have time, and only if you have time, do the ems entry check. otherwise, forget it and go right on into ems initialization. you understand?"
"okay. you're going to delete between 2 hours and 30 minutes and 02:15 there, and you're going to add it, if there is time, only if there is time, at ei minus 1 hour where the ems initialization oc cu/'s ."
"that's right. you got it correctly. okay, jack. one other item. just before ei minus 2 hours and 15 minutes, we need an e-memory dump verb 74 enter. over."
"okay. stand by 1, would you, please?"
"okay. right before 2 hours and 15 minutes, i assume that's before ms?n gives their p27 update, i do a verb 74. right?"
"that's affirmative, jack."
"how much sleep did you get, jack?"
"oh, i guess - stand by. i guess maybe 2 or 3 hours. it was awful cold, and it wasn't very good sleep. 'l'ni""' ,qb/ ':l?l' idll"
"roger. you plan to try to get any more'."""
what get do you have?
we got 132:'37.
"well, if i - if i get everything done, i'll try, but i te21 you, it's almost impossible to sleep. ail of us have that same problem. it's just too cold to sleep."
"roger. 'i_qeway we're looking at it, looks like you ought to have a couple 3 hours here before you have to really get with it. 05 2 38 19 cmp we'll - we'll take it e_sy, hut i - and we'll try to seep_ but it's just; awful cold."
"present data indicates that you_' entry an_le is mjnu._ 6.03 degrees, your det,ta-v at the mideourse is _oingto 2.8 feet a second."

okay.
"and we need the suit circuit relief valve back to auto. correctson, back to close."
"hey, jack, that's in work. /_ld one thing, comparing jim's checklist with my own, i find one difference there at ei minus 02:30. his checklist has me changing a - opening a eps sensor signal circuit breaker right prior to turning off lm power. s - i'd like to find out which checklist is correct. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"hey, jack. _le lm checklist is just for infor- mation to jim. it's just to tell him that - that you're changing back to command module power. your checklist is correct. over."
okay. and when do you figure that you'll be sending up the pads that you have?
"aquarius, all of your pads will be coming up in about 3-1/2 hours, at ei minus 06:30. and one thing we want to remind you of, when you remove power from the con,maud module lm umbilical, is to be sure that you open the lm power main b circuit breakers, both of them, before you start throwing switches and circuit breakers in the lm. do it as we've outlined it in the procedure, in that order. over. 05 12 44 33 lmj_ okay. that's the way we planned on it. we'll let jack do his three and then he'll tell us when we're go from there. what pages are those changes on?"
"okay, fred. the one i've got for you is at the end of power removal from the command module lm umbilical. and just for your information, after you go through that entire procedllre and about the time you're ready to transfer to the command module, at that time, power will be removed from the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it. that is, after you've thrown the switches in the lm. is that clear?"
roger. that's where i've got a remark here to check with you to see if it's all right to pro- ceed.
"roger. and that would be just after, on panel 16, you opening ascent eca control breakers. 05 12 45 _2 lmp which step number is that? 05 12 46 03 lm_ the confusing thing is, jack, where they told me to wait for msfn gc before proceeding was that bat 2 low volts off/reset, then on."
"okay. that's still affirmative. we'll give you a go after waiting 5 seconds, and then down from there just a few steps, after you have opened the asce'nt eca control breakers on panel 16, at that point, the umbilical is not powered, and it's okay to disconnect them should you care to do so."
"okay. after the last step then, i'm free to disconnect."
"right. and one other change we have is, shortly after that, where we're configuring for jettison, we have closed both the forward dump valve and the overhead dump valve. and we don't want to get in a locked up position like that, so one way to get around it is to - after we close the forward dump valve, turn the descent oxygen valve off. over. 05 12 47 7 lmi' okay. after the forward dump valve, add a step in that says the descent ox valve, off."
"okay, fred. that concludes the deltas. and perhaps you heard that our gammas are still minus 6.03 and our delta-v will be a 2.8-foot- per-second rcs burn. 05 2 47 46 lmp roger."
"fred-o, we've got one more change we'd like to give you to clarify a question that jack asked earlier. at ei minus 02'30 - -"
"okay. hold on a minute, jack. i meant to c_ll jack back down. i'm not familiar with the pre- vious discussion."
negative. this is on your checklist.
"okay. go ahead. 05 12 14849 cc at e mi - ei minus 02:30, during power removal from the umbilical, f_rst thing we do is two steps with the csm. we open the main b, the lm power to main b circuit breakers, and then there's a third step which says ""circuit breaker eps sensor signal, main b_ open."" just delete that step. over."
okay. delete the third step.
"and, aquarius, for your information, as far as our water supply is concerned, including our tape 89/$ plans for powerup, we have an additional 18 hours of water remaining from this point. (1512 51 01 i,mp okay. eighteen hottrs of water remaining from this point, jack."
"hello, tlouston; aquarius."
"hello, aquarius. go ahead."
"okay, jack. this is jim. i just want to make sure that you're filtering the changes to the checklist that come up to make sure that they're absolutely essential. when we learn our pro- cedures, we can only do it one time, and we can't make changes at the last minute. we'd like to do the best, the safest way possible, but unless the changes are really essential, don't bother sending them up."
"roger. we won't. the chairman of the cpcb is still active, and one thing we're trying to do is to save you all the time we can between ei minus 02:30 and 1 hour."
that's affirm. that's a real important time.
"yes. for your information, jim, i don't know whether you heard that originally, but that time from 2-1/2 to 1 in there has been run about three times, and it's pretty tight, so we've tried to weed out what we could, which isn't much, but i thinza the other message you might impress on jack _hen you get around to alining that platform, don't try to get it down too neat. it doesn't have to be all that good. just do a nice quick and dirty one, and that's going to be good enough anyway."
"i concur. i think for reentry we don't have to have a real accurate platform, but i haven't told jack that."
"roger. hey, jim, while you're up and things are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of other things to think about. one specifically. i know none of you are sleeping worth a damn because it's so cold, and you might want to dig out the medical kit there around 01:35 or in that ballpark, and pull out a couple of dexedrines apiece and try one about then, and another around 01:39 to 01:40. 05 12 53 i5 cdr well, i hadn't brought that up. we might - we might consider it."
okay.
"wish we could figure a way to get a hot cum of coffee up to you. it'd probably taste pretty good about now, wouldn't it?"
"yes, it sure would. y)u don't realize how cold this thing becomes when it's in a ptc mode that's slowing down, and i just clocked the cycles on my ... and it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and the sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on the engine bell of the service module and not getting down to the spacecraft at all. 05 2 54 6 f hang in there. it won't be long now."
"yes. that's right. as a matter of fact, doing this alinement on the earth this time will be like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, skipper. we figured out a way for you to keep warm. we decided to start powering you up now, and what we want you to do - what we want you to do is take your entry lm prep checklist and start at the top _here it says ""bat 5 nop_,ial feed on,"" and then jump over as it says to your 30-minute activation, and do all of the 30-minute activation up to, but not including, the burn. you copy?"
"okay. if i understand you correctly_ then that gives me leeway to mareuver when we get up to activation complete, and we can be in position for the burn, but we will not burn. we don't have a pad anyway."
"that's affirm, jim. you could maneuver to burn attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude which should put the sun in the windows to warm the place up."
"sounds good, and you're sure we have plenty of electrical power to do this? pag_e 696 05 13 ,'3p9 (ic that's affirmative. we've got plenty of power to do it,. i can f,et you a nlmfier, thoukh. ip, i _ ;""_ ?,'( i,' jim, you'w' t'.ot about o0-pcrccul i,:trl',in:; on every/,hil_f, f'romhere on in. 05 13 l'31t9 cdr that sounds encouraging."
roger. that's in the lm. we're not talking about the csm right now.
i understand.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. question. this short turnon step 3 on page 24 has us only turning on the rcs system a/b, two quads, and tbe breakers are still out on panel 11. did you want those in, too, or are we just going to use one set of heaters?"
"stand by. 05 3 31 32 cc aquarius, houston. go as the checklist recom- mends for now. when you get into the circuit breaker panel configuration, you're going to get the ntmlber 1 set of heaters on anyway."
okay.
"okay, houston. we'd like to get a hack to set our mission timer here, jack."
"okay, fred-o. set it at 133:35 straight up. you've got about 30 seconds to set it."
okay. standing by.
okay. i'll give you the 2-second delay in there. stand by to start.
start. 05 13 35 03 limp okay. we've got it.
okay. i'm counting 133:35:10.
"right on. tape 89/(; ()5  3 _5 4 cc a$1arius, llouston. one other way l,o w:lrm thi_tl_ up in a hurry in there is when you get your ac on to turn on tlle window heaters."
okay. i gaess the ony question i have is what it's liable to do to us with the - looks like almost a frost on it now.
"understand this, jack. i'd like to let it maybe warm up just a little bit more before hitting it with the heat load."
not a bad idea.
"and, as you can see, houston, at turnon we got our old friend downlink 2 back."
"roger. we're seeing it, fred."
"aquarius, houston. it looks like you're proceeding toward the gimbal lock there. we'd like you to check that, please."
"roger. not much we can do about it. we can't use the thrusters, houston."
"okay. forget it now; we'll get it later. 05 13 44 h4 i_mp and, houston, aquarius. i guess the next thing for the pgns will be a coarse aline 000, but i guess we ought to hol_!up now anti we get enough time on the rcs thrusters."
"roger. we're looking at them. we'll give you the go on them. okay, aquarius. your quads are 120 to 133 now, so you're cleared for - cleared for thrusters."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
roger. did you get my go for rcs?
"that's affirm. we're go. what we're doing now, jack, is letting the spacecraft drift in this mode to pick up the earth again."
okay.
"i don't want to just go blasting around the sky and get high rates, because i don't have anything tape 89/'!' to null tho rates on urlt_l the earth comes back up again. and - once i get the e,,_rth ill sif, hl , we haw_ no strain on nullint_ rate:;. that pa't of the l'arth,that is. 05 3 53 50 cdr it's going to be interesting today, jack. the earth's a lot bigger; the crescent is a lot more pronounced than it was yesterday."
"well, you're going in the right direction. 05 13 5h 10 cdr that's right. 05 13 55 27 i24p and, jack, i guess we haven't changed our angle much with respect to the sun 93 million miles away, so it ought to be in about the same place in the aot, isn't that charlie?"
"tiold1 on that, fred. i'll get an answer for you. 05 13 55 54 lm' okay."
"aquarius, your asa is warmed up now. you can activate the ags. (3513 57 26 lmp okay."
"aquarius, houston. when you look out a detent 2 in the proper burn attitude, what you ought to see is the sun at 12 o'clock, about halfway between the top of the aot and the center of the pipper. and you ought to see the earth - -"
"okay. 05 14 o 04 cc - - at 6 o'clock. 05 1io1 07 lmp okay. 05 lh o1 41 cdr and, it's getting a little warmer in here now. thank you."

okay.
"aquarius, something we're thinking about right now is, if we can do it without using a lot of rcs, it would be to our advantage timewise to try to get an alinemer,t."
okay. you mean a p527 05 il_ ll 05 cc we're - -

"houston, aquarius."

it's closed.
roger. it'll be a few - -
... closed ... -
"okay. and it'll be a _ew minutes yet, jim. we're still cranking it up."
"okay. stay with it, jack, and i'll go back to data."
roger.
i got bat in about 33-1/3 percent on that u_nk. too fast alarm.
"say again on that, fred."
"i just got another uplink too fast when i took the data switch back off - it's happening, i guess, about a third of the time."
roger.
"aquarius, houston. we're ready with your load if you'll give us data please."
going to data. you got it.
"aquarius, houston. after the uplink, you'll have to set the drift and the refs_mat flag as on page 8 of the contingency book, steps 5 and 6."
"page 8, steps 5 and 6. roger. 05 14 37 21 ia_p okay. are you done with the computer now, jack? 05 14 _7 24 cc negative. we'll give you the word."
"roger. aquarius, we're through with it, it's your computer."
thank you.
"and, aquarius, houston; take option i on a p52 when you get to it. and i've got some ball angles for a sun and moon."
"okay. we want an option 1 and you've got some ball angles for sun and moon. and right now, jim has the sun pretty well squared away right in the middle of aot."
"and have you got some plan in vectors for us, jack?"
"okay, fred-o. for the san, i've got 246; for the moon i've got 250."
are you talking about ball theta angles?

"just as a note of interest_ in this dock con- figurations for p52s, the command module docking probe is right down the middle of - the dock_n_ l_ght, rather, is r_ght down the middle of the detent. and when the sun flashes on, it really makes it difficult."
roger.
just like the simulator.
yes. it was good training.
"well, jack_ that's what it says the torquing angles are."
we haven't got them yet.
"aquarius, hold on to torquing angles, flease."
we're doing that.
"jim, the reason for the delay is that we're not seeing the data yet. we're having to check a point here; and as soon as they come up, we'll let you know what to do with them."
"okay. we had a large noun 105 of - what - 112, and our torquing angles, jack, are minus 01713, minus 03278, minus 01395."
"roger. minus 01713, and we see them now."
"aquarius, torque them."
okay.
"at 35:04:25. 05 15 06 0 cc aquarius, do you have a star close by there you could check?"
"i'll look around, jack. i was just trying to get a check on the moon, again, to see if those angles were indeed true, and we got the moon back again and centered."
roger.
"okay, jack. what you're reading now the angles? we had the moon centered, and it's pretty close to what we have on the 8 ball, i guess. close enough for any entry that we'd like to do."
roger. and i'm told that denubla - denebola and regulus are nearby if you wanted to make a star check.
"okay. i'm going to start pitching around again, and i'll see if i can pick them up. i have orion out here to my left a little bit, but it's pretty close to the - oh, here. i've got sirius. that's a nice one. tiow about that?"
sounds good here.
"aquarius, is jack sitting on the rumble seat there?"
he was. he just headed upstairs to take another look around.
okay. i got a minor addition to the entry check- list for him. this time it's in the - -
okay. stand - -
- - entry book.
okay. stand by 1. he has that in his pocket.
"what i'm doing, jack, is just - i'm pitching over now. i'm going to pick up another star. sirius was just too far off. i thought i was going to use too much gas getting there."
"roger. b_ rlim. il' w_: didrl't, l_a.w' od,y:;:my att;j, ehr:d, wr- (!ould ju::t auto - aij'i'(' _i_lri:ivt_fov_-_rir) these thing,s. 05 15 6 28 cc looks to us l_ke you've _ot her alined, jim, so i wouldn't worry about it too much."
yes. i'm pretty confiaent that the platform's fairly descent.
"aquarius, houston. we need an e hod verb 74, when you've got a chance, please."
okay. coming to you.
"okay, jack. on your entry checklist, on pa? 2-5. down there on step 9, where it says 152 degrees pitch at .o5g, adjacent to that, so that recovery can see you better on the way down, we want you to turn your s-band_ power amplifier to high. over. 05 i5 23 25 cmp okay. turn s-band, power amp to high at .o5g time."
that's affirmative. 05 15 23 49 cml_ okay. is that it?
"that's it, jack."
"aquarius, houston. we're considering doing the midcourse with pgns, _lless you'd rather do it in ags."
"no. pgns is fine with me. i just aline myself up with the old ball again. so i've got you foresighted again, but any way you want to do it."
"like you say, you might as well go first class."
i guess you're right.
"now wait a minute, jack."
"i just lost a lot of friends there. 05 15 35 20 i2_p and, jack, you can tell owen morris that the rcs system a/b 2 quad 1 breaker is still nicely in. i)515 35 52 cc roger. we'll pass the word. 05 15 73821 cc aquarius, tlouston. we think we've figured out a way to save you some time at a very critical -- very full schedule. and that's by doing a docked coarse aline, since we got the lm up now. that would save you a maneuver or two."
"houston, aquarius. it seemed to me a docked coarse aline might be quicker for - for jack."
"yes. we think it would be, and it'd save quite a bit of time at a place where you're going to be pretty busy. also save you some petrol."
"affirm. 05 15 40 3 cc okay, jim. we're looking at doing this in the service module sep attitude, and the optics will be pointed away from the sun. so it should be a good attitude for a p52."
"okay. so, we'll be going to the service module sep attitude, at which time we'll do a docked coarse aline, and -"
then you want - you want jack then to do a p527
"the way we'll do that in our time line jim, is to go ahead and do the service module jett and then we'll just stay in that attitude and when it comes time in our time line as we've outlined, to bring the platform up, we'll proceed with the p52 - coarse aline, and then the p52."
"okay. are we going to use the same techniques that we normally do for lm activation? in other words, i try to maintain an attitude, smd give him some angles and then - are you going to give him the angles? then he does the 52."
"basically, it's the same procedure just reversed, jim."
okay.
"another nice thing about this, is it's one we've done before."
"and, aquarius. one thing, however, that we do not plan to do is to proceed with the command module powerup prematurely. patio: '(0(_ 05 15 42 51 om' ioger. 05 l5 11257 cdr understand."
"okay, houston. this is jack."
"co ahead, ,jack. al'ohl,() i _ air-to-ji(ouni) voice traiisci_ip'i'ion i'age 707"
"okay. i just wanted to talk over with you, it looks like we've had some changes in the flight plan here, due to jim's. p52. do you have - can you talk over with me what your plans are?"
"roger, jack. since we've got the pgns up, we plan to use that information to give the cmc a dock coarse alone, and then we're in the service module jettison attitude, we'll wait until it comes time to power up the cmc, and we'll get the cmc a dock coarse aline, and we'll pick some good stars to give you a fine aline with, and it looks like we can pick some stars that are looking away from the sun in wlieh you can find in that service module jettison attitude; so, we'll save you quite a bit of gas: and save you some time in a very busy time. )515 46 36 cmp hey, that sounds good. really fine."
"keeping warm? 05 15 h6 43 cmp hey, it's warmed up here now. it's almost com- fortable."
"i'm looking out the window now, jack, and that earth is whistling in like a high-speed freight train."
we're clocking you at b8 000 miles and coming in at about 9000.
"i don't think there's nany lms that have seen it like this. i'm still )_ooking for fra mauro and cone crater. 05 5 47 38 cc you're going the wrong way, son."
"okay, jack. it looks - just looking over what i may expect here, it locks like i'm just going to get three angles to do a verb 41 noun 20, right?"
"that's what it looks like from here, jack. it's pretty much the opposite of the lm activation procedure where we do the dock coarse aline."
"yes, except in a way we did a lot of verb 06 noun 20, enters, simultaneously, and then you all shipped him up post-torque values. you're not going to do anything like that are you?"
"say again, please, jack."
"okay. during the activation part, we do a lot of verb 06 noun 20, enters simultaneously, reading you out the difference in the angles, and then mbfn furnishes the post-torquing angles, in order to get the platform fine alined. do you plan something like that or just three coarse aline angles."
"jack, we're going to give you three coarse aline angles, and then you c_n go right to your cheek- list as we're giving it, and start in with the verb 40 noun 20."
okay. re_l fine.
"asld,jack, how do you _ead?"
fine - square.
"i was arolmd shooting tictures of all the debris inside here, before we left, and i inadvertently changed the settings ox the dc command module reseau camera that we need for the service module pictures. i wonder if fao can dig them out again - what we need, f-stop a_ldspeed."
"okay, fred. stand by."
"fred, in regards to the camera settings, for black-and-white 3400 film, the settings were f:5.6 at 1/250th. 0ve_."
"okay. i'd guessed right after all, but thank you."
"aquarius, houston. ov(r."

"say again, joe."
"roger, fred. i have a service module sep pad with the attitudes. you don't need a pad sheet for it; just any old blank sheet will do."
okay. i was going to say i don't - we don't hardly carry a service module sep pad.
"yes, we'll have to change that. 05 6 09 02 lmp okay. i'm using a p27 here. go ahead."
"okay. the pad reads as follows and then i'll re- peat the angles for yo_, so you can copy them. the following mcc-7, maneuver the lm to the following fdai attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 91.3; yaw, 000. now do you want those attitudes re- peated, fred?"

stand by. i'll have tc_try to borrow his book from him.
roger.
"can we hold off on that a little bit, joe?"
"oh, absolutely, jim. we're well ahead. i just wanted to let you know that we had it. 05 16 6 25 cdr okay. i hope that when you send up all those uplinks to jack that you could get them up tc him quicky."
"we're shooting for les,,_than 5 minutes."
sounds good. 05 16 i6 43 lmp and are you still using the computer?
"that's a negative, fred. the computer _s yours."
"and, fred, the computer has your target load in."
okay.
"ttouston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. i just want to clarify one thing on the lm sep pad. it appears to me that in my configura- tion, i could probably use a verb 49 loading in 622, yaw, pitch, and roll, in that order; and then being able to fly out at 5018 in roll, pitch, and yaw. is that correct?"
"stand by; i'll verify it, jim."
"okay, joe. and while you're doing that i've got a question about the command module checklist."
"okay, jack. go ahead with your question."
"okay. either i copied the circuit breaker wrong, or - i can't read it. comes down just about the - paf;__712 oh, about the 20th one down, after panel 276, who:re it ._;ay_cb inst_i_entat1on power control 3 and il,op(,n. the next circuit l_reaker on panel 5 - i - would you give that to me again?"

that's affirmative.
acluarius_ houston.
"co ahead, joe."
"roger. the word we ha""_e is that you can't make a verb 49 ma_leuver to vhe lm jettison attitude because those are fdai angles we gave you, they don't correspond to tht? gimbal angles for the load; it'll have to be a manual maneuver. over."
okay.
and mind out for gimb_ lock.
we will.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"roger. we're looking _ttlm current, to see if jack has started his preheat, and we haven't seen it yet. is he doing okay down there?"
"houston, jack said he's already started it, and he said that in 1 more minute, he'll be up to 20 minutes."
oh. roger that.

okay. and thanks for keeping us on it.
okay.
"aquarius, hom_ton."
go ahead.
roger. reminder p41 for the rcs burn. 05 16 1_654 cdr thanks for keeping us honest.
we got to protect our jobs_ jim.
we've been dps-ing so cng here.
yes.
"okay, houston. i finished up the maneuvers, the auto maneuver in 41._b_t niyroll and yaw needles seem to be offset. pitch is okay."
"okay, jim. we copy. stand by. aquarius, houston. we recommend pgns mode control to att hold. save a little gas and stand by on the error needles."
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. dis you call?"
"roger, joe. figured, if we're going to do this burn in pgns now, i ought to give you an update on the contingency book pages 32, 33, and 34, be- cause the last time we went through this portion, we were burning it in acs. ta_;e91/8 l':j.l_a' 7 4 (?, 17 ob 2'1' c( ()k;ky , l,'r','d. ;;c:tltd by, w,t'v,' b_,'n l._l.kinli about i_o::::;bly itav'ir_/"" .you do il in /5;i;i. we p,..,::ommend at ia,i:: t,irrle lhrd, ,you (;) ylrjalii; ,(1 'cjn_;:ti in""_, the lie)() piti:; 3 proc-_dm tm only. over."

"okay. joe, do you want me to line up the same way we did the last one, too?"
"stand by on that. 05 17 (3657 lmp and, joe, jack just hsalded me some injector _.e'_.:er- atures, if yot,want to read these on ... so i ?_; plug them in."
roger. go ahead with those.
"okay. 5 charlie, 14.0;5 dogs, 3.7; 6 able, 3.5; 6 bravo, 4.1; 6 charlie, 4.2; 6 delta, 3.8."
"okay. copy those, fred."
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, jim. our recommendation on this burn is that you maneuver to the bucn attitude, in pgns min impulse, then do a bodt-axis aline, 400 plus 5, followed by h00 plus 0, and then do the burn in ags. over."
"okay. now we're spinn2ng it with the pgns, what you gave us for a pgns attitude. is this the wrong one? do you want me to just to aline up the earth as i did before in the last midcourse?"
"no. we don't want you to do that. read me your ?dai angles, and let's compare them with what we have down here. pa_,e 75 05 7 09 55 cdr okay. you're looking at them in the dsky. i've got roll c_f8.)47; pitch of about 0.51; and yaw looking at about b.750."
"okay, jim. those are very close - i guess all you need to do is trim them up a bit."
"i plan to do a final trim - auto trim, and then a four-jet translation."
"okay, jim. for fuel conservation, we'd prefer you to trim it up min impulse, and there's really very little trim required; and then go al_ead and do it ags. we're on the expected fuel usage, but we're just being old ladies about it."
"okay. understand. m_ only question, joe, is the fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did not go to null when i did an auto maneuver. i'd tried to go manually to the attitude; s_ldthen went to auto, but the roll and the yaw do not come in at all. 05 7 11 14 cc roger. i haven't got an answer on that yet, but your attitude looks ve_7 close."
okay. i can take it on ...
"and, houston, aquarius. i'm not sure that if i follow and null the needles, that will be the proper attitude. 05 7 13 02 cc okay. stand by 1, jim. we're talking about it. it's going to be very close; in any event, close enough."
"okay. 05 17 lb 16 cc and, jim, just for yotn'information, i have the entry pad. i have the landing area weather summary, which you probably don't even have to copy, but which i'll read up to you when you're ready; and some stars for jack that i'm holding for him for later on."
okay.
"and, joe, jack says ali the injector temperatures, he just checked them again, and they're all over 3.9--"
that they're all over 3.9 now. thanks a lot. 05 7 3 58 cc you can tell him that it's looking good to us. they were even happy with the previous ones.
okay.
"and, nv only question, houston, is do you want me to null the pgns needle manually?"
"okay. stand by 1 more minute, jim."
"houston, aquarius. 05 17 16 h9 cc go ahead, aquarius."
"yes. i guess the basic question is comparing the balls here and out the window it doesn't look too unreasonable, and i guess jim says the coas is yawed and roll slightly off from what he might eyeball; but yet, the fdai air needles for pgns are showing a full scale left in roll and full scale left in yaw ...."
okay. go ahead.
"yes. it appears if we track those we, obviously, aren't going to be on the attitude that we burned the last midcourse."
"okay. well, this attitude we passed you is not quite alined to the tez_ninator, and stand by on this."
"it should be off about 8 degrees, flight. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription tape 92/ 'a_?, 'fi 7 05 17 '?() i_)1 cdi_ ijow you ooir_l_, t,hor'r:, iolj:,l,orl?"
"oh, we're getting there, jim. we're - we're all agreed that you're almost, but not quite, in the proper attitude, and we're just trying to get you one firm recommendation on how to proceed from here."
okay. i have nulled the null - roll needle and the pitch needle now and i'm yawed - rolled left now. i'm rolled left about 9 degrees.
okay. understand the needles are nulled.
"the yaw isn't, but the pitch and roll are."
roger that.
"aquarius, tlouston."
go ahead.
"okay. here's the big story. your attitude really looks quite good except in roll, and we'd like you to do the following. in min impulse pgns, we'd like you to trim to zero pitch, which is about where you are now; to 008 degrees in roll, which is about 16 degrees from your pres- ent roll attitude; and to zero degrees in yaw, which is about where you are now. then we'd like you to do the body-axis aline 400 plus 5, 400 plus 0. pitch and roll to pulse, select ags, do the burn in ags. how does that sound? over."
"okay. i'm rolled the wrong way; that is what you're saying, right?"
that's right. 05 17 21149 cdr and you know i can't roll in minimum impulse. i've got to use ttcas.
"that's right, jim. sorry."
"and you don't want me to automatically trim 5018, i take it."
"that's affirm, jim. don't trim 5018."
okay.
we just want you to cycle on through p41 to get the average g and burn it out.
"okay. 05 7 27 5 cc aquarius, houston."
"go ahead. )517 27 54 cc just for your information, we see 3.0 in regis- ter 1. we read you up 3.1 on the pad. the actual delta-v was 3.05, and they warned me that it might come out 3.0. (3517 28 11 cdr okay. that's a l_ttle burn."
right.
"aquarius, tiouston. your attitude looks real good. we will give you a mark at 10 minutes to the burn, which is in 28 seconds. 05 17 29 h6 cdr okay. we'll burn it in ags and use the ags ball."
"right. i was looking at the wrong clock, and we're a little under 10 minutes now. 1,11 give you a mark at 9 minutes. okay?"
that's fine.
"aquarius, houston. we have 10 seconds until 9 minutes to the burn. 3, 2, 1 -"
mark.
nine minutes.
very well. that agrees with our event timer.
okay.
"okay, houston. about 3 minutes to go, a_ldwe're all squared away."
"and, aquarius; houston. roger that. and we're standing by for your body-axis aline and your zeroing 404, 405, 406, going to 470. j'age719 ()'_ 17 _' ;""( i,mi' okay. y_)u'd asked - y_u'd asked me before, joe, to go 400 jjur, 3, whictj  did. i assume you've changed lb(! :;cript a6a:fl."

okay.
yes. it looks like we had a minus 0.2 bias at 470. we're burning.
"copy that, fred."
"good show, aquarius."
"we're tweaking now, joe."
"roger. aquarius, houston. you're good right where you are."
"okay. that's it. 05 17 40 49 i_mp okay. if you're happy, can we maneuver to service module sep attitude now?"
"that's affirmative, aquarius."
and i'm pitching up to the proper attitude.
okay. we're looking at it.
and it's again necessary to use the ttca to pitch.
okay. affirmative.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, houston."
okay. recommend you terminate p41.
okay.
"hey, jim, have you broken into the medical kit per my recommendation a few hours ago?"
yes. everything is taken care of deke.
"okay, fine. you might hit it again in about 2 hours. t_/pe 92/4 05 17 _1755 cdr okay. 05 7 50 37 cc aquarius, houston. aft omni."
"i beat you to it, houston."
"yes. i thought you did, but i thought i'd s_--, it anyway."
"okay, aquarius; ttouston. that attitude looks pretty good. itow's jack getting along?"
"he's getting along, all set to go. and i'm geing to go into pgns att hold."
"roger. 05 17 5'06 cc, aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"roger. again for fuel-consumption reasons, we'd like you to go back to the ags mode you were in rather than pgns att hold. over."
"okay. i'm in pgns minimum impulse right now while we're firing. and i'll go back to the ags mode. 05 17 5'-(31 cc okay, jim. pgns min impulse is okay; ags is okay too. it's your choice."
"soon as we get rid of the service module, joe, i think i'll be able to maneuver a lot better. 05 7 57 42 cc sure thing. 05 7 57 48 cdr okay, jack just reported that all thrusters fired on both rings."
real fine. real fine.
and sm jett at 138:12.

and there's one whole side of that spacecraft missing. 05 18 0_ 50 cc is that right?
"right by the - look out there, will you? right by the high gain antenna, the whole panel is blown out, almost from the base to the engine."
copy that.
"yes, it looks like it got to the sps bell, too, houston."
"think it zinged the sps engine bell, huh? l'a6e '12'2"
that's the way it looks; unless that's just a dark brown stre_k. it's really a mess.
"okay, jim. we'd like you to get some pictures, but we want you to conserve rcs. don't make unnecessary maneuvers."
"and, jim; houston. in particular, of course, _,'e don't want any translation maneuvers."
"right on that. joe, you realize that when i went up to the sm sep attitude, i had to use ttca to do it. 05 8 06 25 cc that's affirm. we know that. that's okay."
"ail right. she's drifting right down in front of our windows now, ilouston."
okay.
"okay, joe, i'm now looking down the sps bell, and it looks - looks okay on the inside; maybe it is just a streak."
"okay. copy that, fred. was the bell deformed on the outside or just nicked or what?"
"i think the explosion, from what i could see, joe, had - had stained it. i don't knew whether it did any actual deformation or not."
okay.

"well, it was varying lengths. is it suppose to be a long-time proceed? )518 20 56 cc we think it may be, jack. we think it may be 15 to 20 seconds, and our recommendation is that you pro and hold it down for a good period ef time, probably half a minute or more, and see if the dsky blanks."
"okay. all right, i didn't hold it in that long. maybe 2 or 3 seconds is the longest i held it."
okay.
"okay, jack just came down the tunnel again and said the computer's okay."
okay. good to hear it. and did you ever get that bat c main a reading for us?

okay.
"joe, jack tells me that there's still a lot of particles floating around and he's - he can't pick out any constellation that he recognizes so far. but it might clear here in a little while."
"okay, understand."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
"okay. eecom is looking at that battery amperage that you gave us awhile ago. he'd like to see it about a half an amp to an amp lower. like you to ask jack to just check the circuit breakers and switches that he's pulled in so far and make sure he doesn't have any extra loads on main a; specifically, the floodlight configuration, and his caution and warning circuit breakers, and his essential instrumentation power circuit breakers. over."

go ahead.
"okay. i've been not reading any voltage at all on bat c, and the amperage looks like about 2 amps, but that could be kind of noise-level stuff. i've got all the floodlights off and i - can you think of anything - i could power dewar to lower main a."
okay. how about reading the voltage off of main a?
"okay. oh, this is ken. okay. ken, it was 30.2. 05 _8 36 03 cc 0ksy. we're checking out the floodlights we gave you. actually, jack, you ought to be able to go ahead and use the lights we gave you. there's no reason to sit in the dark. _aey're supposed to be coming off of main b, and we're checking that now."
okay. it's not bad down there. we're in - got plenty of light. but should i be reading the voltage on bat c?
"jack, you should be reading bat c voltage. that circuit breaker should be open."
"okay. okay, can you think of anything else you want to get turned off to lighten load on main a?"
"okay. we're perusing that subject right now, jack. it's really not that big a thing, just something we wanted to dress up."
okay.
"okay, aquarius; houston."
go ahead.  i
"say, jim, as something to try, you might have jack turn off the ring l's auto coils, which are probably on main a. rave him turn those off and take a look at the readings."
okay.
"okay. jack has turned off ring 1 that was on main a, and he's still reading 30.2 volts."
"roger that, jim. what's his amperage? did he read that off?"
i guess. re says it's down in the mud; it's less than 2 amps.
"down in the mud. okay, understand that. re$1est he turn them back on and - okay, jim, that's the auto coils back on ring 1, _in a, and when you get that done, i'd like you to copy the entry pad."
"okay, joe. standing by to copy the entry pad."
"okay, here we come. entry pad: mid-pacific, 000153; 000. the next two lines will be the get of moonset and the moon-check attitude; 142:38:17, 178; noun 61, minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; 142:40:40; 00:28. the next four are n/a; do is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22, 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9. boresight star is sigma libra, down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up. comments: gdc for entry alinement, stars 31 and 23. the roll aline 041, pitch 245, yaw 024, use ems nonexit pattern. maintain moon-check attitude until moonset; then go to entry atti- tude or track horizon with the 36-degree window mark. last comment: constant g entry is roll right. over."
"entry pad as follows: mid-pac, 000153, 000; 142:38:17, 178; minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; 142:40:40; 00:28. next four columns are n/a; do is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9. zebra libra, or something like that, beta libra is down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up; gdc entry alined, stars 31, 33. roll 041, pitch, 045, yaw 024. ems nonexit pattern to be used; 'l'_j.fje%_/13 mainbair_ moor,-ch(_ck atl,itudc t,_rllt moozl_c_t, and if al1 else is lost, thc constant g entry is right - roll is right."
"okay. roger that, jim. i want to verify a couple of things i'm not sure i heard you read back. the first one was zebra libra (laughter) that's sigma libra. the set stars 31 and 23. did you get that? over."
"okay. no, i had 31 and 33, and i got sigma libra now, and it'll be 31 and 23 for the set stars."
"okay. and your gdc pitch aline, i wasn't sure whether that was - whether you read back 245 or 045. the correct number is 245. over."
"good show, because i have 045 down. 245."
"okay. and the moon check here, unlike the horizon check, is on the 36-degree window mark all the way. just wanted to repeat that."
moon check on 30-degree window mark.
"that's 36-degree window mark, jim."
three six. roger.
"okay. readback correct. and, aquarius; houston. if you want me to read you the landing area summary, i'll do that."
sounds good.
"okay. in the mid-pacific landing area, the weather is good. the cloud cover is 2000, scattered; visibility, 10; winds 060 at 10; wave heights are 4 feet, and the altimeter 2986, if you care. scattered showers less than 10 percent of the area. recovery forces are as follows: the iwo jima will be at the touchdown point, the aircraft call sign will be recovery 1, on station with swimmers on board. the - we have the constant g backup reentry area covered with the uss hall, the good liberty ship, and the other recovery aircraft whose call signs you may hear are samoa rescue c-130s. tat_e 92/14 pa_9' '(31) ()', t/ )_' /i (_1)1_ ()k:ly, l'inc. w_' haw_ th'-' iwo ,lima il.:; ltl,, priln,' r('covcry :;ill,. 05 18 it734 cc that's correct."
"joe, jack tells me he is still having trouble looking through the optics. i'm just going to pitch up a little bit more here to see if he can get into the dark spot."
"okay, real fine. you might tell him when we get to that point, we have some - some stars with corresponding shaft and trunnion angles to pass to him as backups in case the computer doesn't happen to point him straight at one. and it's the summer triangle."
"and are you tracking us, and do you have any results on that last midcourse?"
stand by. it looks good. i'll try and get you num_bers. aiollo 13 air-to-troui_i)voice ti_tnscii?l!ion pa_e 731 (1518 52 14 cd_ it feels nic_ to use the hand controller again.
"go ahead, aquarius."
"i just said, joe, it feels nice to use the hand controller again."
oh. roger that. fid0 says he's got you nailed within a half a foot per second; the midcourse looked real good.
okay.
"and i've got two things we'd like jack to do in the command module to ease the load on main a. one of them is to verify or turn the cm/rcs heater switch to off. we're done with that, and even though the circuit breakers are pulled, the switches might be drawing a little current. and the second one is, we'd like him to turn scs logic power 2/3 to off; we don't need it now. it's called up in the checklist at the appropri- ate time, and we'd like him to turn that off. over."
"okay. i'll tell jack to check that the cm/rcs heater switch is off_ and, if not, we'll turn it off; and also to turn off the scs logic power 2/3 switch, off, since it comes up later in the checklist."
that's correct.
"houston, aquarius. we're recording main a volt- age up to 31.0."
roger. that's 31.0. we're smiling.
"houston, aquarius."
"go, aquarius."
okay. how about if i hold a pitch attitude of about 115 instead of about 91. i think jack can use the optics a little bit better at that angle.
"jim, that's perfectly okay with us, if it looks good for stars. 05 8 59 35 cdr tiejust ooked at them briefly; i'l _o down :_nd look at them a little bit better here."
"okay. with the new attitude, our shaft and trun- nion angles we were going to pass him don't mean anything, but it's more important to have a good star field."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, jim. we - we've been talking about your going to a different a_titude than the pad atti- tude for better star field vision out the command module, and what we'd like to have you do is this. if you can predict now or sometime soon, what attitude it is that you would like to hold at that time, and go to that attitude now, we'd like to be able to compute the coarse aline gimbal angles for the csm, and we can do that if you go to the selected attitude, hold it, call up a verb 06 noun 20, and read us your lm gimbal angles, we can take those and compute csm coarse aline gimbal angles on the assumption that, when we get back into the csm coarse aline, you will return to that selected attitude. does that sound okay? over."
"yes. i'll try to hold the attitude we select directly, while you're giving us the coarse aline attitude. we're not too sure what - what's the best attitude. i'm going to ask jack again if 115 is sufficient for him."
"okay. you can take some time figuring out the best attitude, and then you won't have to hold it all the way from now until then, if you just get back to it. 05 19 2 58 cdr houston, jack would like to know what constella- tions are in his sextant, or scanning telescope, field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch, zero roll, zero yaw. can you give that to us?"
"okay. we'll sure give it a go. as i said, we - we have some stars. they're not - they're not centered with the shaft and trunnion zero. let us take a quick look at 105 pitch, shaft and trunnion zero, and see if we can get you an answer. ff, iu i _,',;' fi(_ aql,l:_,r'il.l,';, llol_::l.i)ll. ()5 li? lb b', f:l)ll (0 ahc:j.(l. 05 19 13 5(_ cc roger. these - none of these stars will be exactly centered, but, at a pitch attitude of 115, we had computed that vega, altair, rasalhague, and deneh would all be in the telescope field of view, and the first three were also in view at the 91-degree pitch, so he should be able to see one or more of those four stars. over."
"okay. thank you, very much."
"okay. and, jim, i can give shaft and trunnions if - if he's interesteb."
"okay. why don't you give us the shaft and tr:_l- nion for - say, altair at 115, and i'll go up there, and i'll see if he can pick it up."
"okay. real fine, at 115 degrees of pitch, altair, shaft 274, trunnion 22.2. over."
"roger. shaft is 274, trunnion 22.2."
that's affirm.
"aquarius, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
"okay, jim. in the lm, there we have - we show battery 3 only drawing about an amp, and we think it's probably time to get it off the line; bat- tery 3 to off/reset. over."
battery 3 is off/reset. 05 19 6 12 cc okay.
"just bow's our power consumption, houston, just out of curiosity?"
"i'll verify it, jim. i'm sure it's okay."
"okay, aquarius; houston. with the present amount of power you've got in the i24,which is over 500 amp-hours, and the rate you're using them, we figure you've got a_nost 12 hours of power left. 05 19 7 04 cdr twelve hours, huh? we could reenter with it."
that's affirm.
"that's enough for two touch-and-goes and a full stop, jim."
"that's right, joe; if you could dig a crater like cone crater, i could might hit it."
(laughter) okay.
jack reports that he thinks he can see altair.
very good.
"liesays, he thinks he can see altair. 05 19 17 /t4 cc okay. i'll take back the ""very,"" but i'll leave the ""good."""
"houston, aquarius. i"
"aquarius, houston. go."
"i ran back there to take a look and see what i could see in the - in the scanning telescope. it looks pretty grim back there right now. it might be that we have to go with the coarse aline, and maybe computation of some fine aline docking angles, if we have time."
"okay. we'd like to do that, too. wait a minute; stand by, jim."
"aquarius, houston. how do you read?"
"i read you loud and clear. )519 23 32 cc okay. what we'd like to do, jim, is - we'll go ahead and get the coarse aline to the gimbal angles that - that you're going to be holding for us; and we'll get the platform up, and then when you call p52 and you use picapar, it prob- ably won't be close enough to put the star in the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a bright star in the general vicinity, - and like general vicinity, i mean 2 to 3 degrees from the center of the telescope, so that you have some clue as to which way to go, then the identifica- tion problem shouldn't present much of a - of a !':!_' '3' dil'l'iculty. and once you get t,l.. t,hin5 il. t,h,' sextant, thon you earl go ahead and treat il, .ilk,. any other i'capar."
"that sounds great, ken. one little problem: there's all sorts of bright objects floating around us, and also that just staring at part of aquarius; it's just reflecting light like mad. we can give it a try. there's no problem there; if we can see it, we'll get it."
"okay. and in - in the event that that doesn't work, we're standing by with the original scheme, a set of lm fdai angles to fly to that'll point the command module optscs at the moon and the sun; so we can always go back to that."
"okay. (/519 25 10 cc and, aquarius, houston. we'd like you to verify the suit relief valve to closed. over."
stand by. it's closed.
okay.
"okay, houston; aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go."
"we'll go with your original 91-degree angle, if you have the stars figured out, and the coarse aline angle for it."
"okay. roger that, jim. then at - at your con- venience here, we'd like you to go to that atti- tude, as close as you can get, and call up a noun 20 for us."
okay. in work now.
okay.
"houston, aquarius."
"go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. i take it that, if - if jack cannot see stars at this attitude after you give him the coarse aline angles, we're just not going to j pat? 736 r',.ad dowrl 1,_,y,,u _mr' _imh:l :lhl_j_::; arid h:lvo you i'i/_ur(, _ul, r_ i,:_r*l_,'l, :l,rlgl_: i*_r' .j:zek, bul you w_lrjt him to do r;i_iitrig on the moor and the sun. i_ that correct?"
"that's roughly correct, jim. jack will coarse aline at that attitude. this is what we're hav- ing you maneuver to the - to that attitude for. we're going to compute coarse aline gimbal angles and pass them up to him, and the first thing he'll do when he gets there, per his checklist, is to coarse aline his platform. then he'll go into the p52, and, if he can't see stars, we will quickly pass up to you the - your fdai angles to put him in the moon-view attitude, and he'll do his p52 on the moon, and then have you maneuver on the sun and complete the p52 of the sun."
okay. but i'm going to have to maneuver to the moon to help him out.
"oh. that's - that's affirmative. if he can't see stars at the - at the sep attitude that - that you'll be holding, you'll have to maneuver to the moon attitude and then to the sun attitude for him."
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"just like to mention that, even if, for some reason, we run out of time or something and don't complete the moon-sun p52, jack will have a platform coarse aline to the entry refsmmat, which we feel will be plenty good enough."
"roger. that's my feelings, too. 05 19 3'48 cc okay."
"aquarius, houston."
"hello there, houston."
"hi! jim, we - we've gone ahead and computed the csm coarse aline gimbal angles based on your being at the service module sep attitude at the time that jack cranks up the computer and - and coarse alines the imu. that is, we assume that 'age737 you're going to be at roll, 0; pitch, 091; yaw, 0; and, if you concur on that, i'd like to pass up the angles for - for ,yackto have."
okay. i'll be there to the best of my ability.
good show. you ready to copy?
go ahead.
"okay. csm coarse aline angles: roll, plus 298.95; pitch, plus 271.30; yaw, plus 000.20."
"okay. the command module angles will be: roll, 298.95_ pitch, 271.30; and yaw, 000.20."
"that's affirmative, and that's for his verb 4 noun 20 when he gets there."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"go ahead, ttouston; aquarius here."
"okay, jim. we're getting about 9 minutes from the commencement of command module powerup, and we wanted to just mention to you for jack's benefit that, although the batteries are looking real good, in case they're cool and have a little difficulty hacking the load just at first, we'd like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts or above during the powerup procedure and, if it falls below, we'll have a couple of circuit breakers for him that - that will solve the prob- lem."
okay. and i take it you're also monitoring main bus voltage.
"negative. not in the command module at this time, because we don't call up telemetry until a little bit later on."
ah so. that's right; i forgot. okay. i will tell him.

i'll doublecheek. they're hearing you.
"okay. good deal. i don't hear them, yet."
"are you ready for an e-memory dump, verb 74?"
"stand by for just 1 minute, jim."
"we've got a lot of things to do, houston."
"i know it. okay, aquarius; houston. recommend in odyssey that he switch the power amplifier to low. over."
power amplifier to low.
"it's been switched to low, houston."
"roger. okay. verify the power amp talkback is gray, jim."
okay. that's verified.

aquaritts_ houston.
go ahead.
we have high bit rate; we are standing by for the verb 74 enter and the e-mod dump.
"roger. thank you. 05 20 21425 cmp joe, how do you read?"
"okay. read you, babe."
"okay, loud and clear. verb 74 coming down."
"okay. copy that, jack."
and i'l be ready for your p27 update.
okay.
"and i'm in accept,"
okay. understand you are in po0 and accept. verify omni charlie.
okay. joe s we are omni charlie. we have little bit better signal strength on another 0mni.
okay. stand by.
"okay, odyssey' houston. select your own best omni and then repeat verb 74 enter. over."
"okay, odyssey; houston. we are locked on solid high bit rate now; repeat the verb 7_ enter. over. delay that; hold the verb 74 1 minute. wait."
"you're too late, joe; it's coming down."
"0key, odyssey, houston."
go ahead.
okay. we are going to skip the e-mod dump for right now and get the uplink in.
okay. po0 and accept.
"okay. po0 and accept. and, jack, you can go ahead with the imu and optics powerup. over. 05 20 27 514 lmp roger. it's in work."
oksy.
"... unable to read any bat b voltage. we do have current _ though, on bat b."
"okay. copy that, fred."
why don't you check?
"you're looking good on the ground, odyssey."
okay.
and i think the reason you don't read voltage is it's a circuit breaker that we have called as being out.
all right.
"odyssey, houston. the uplink is going well. we have one more load to get in."
okay. real fine.
"is the computer mine now, joe? 05 20 39 3 cc stand by 1 second."
"okay, jack. we'd like the verb 74 enter, and it'll take less than a minute for e-mod dump."
coming down.
"and, jack s houston. it'll be 100 seconds on that."
okay. can i go to block on the up telemetry?
"not just yet, jack."
"odyssey, houston. you can go to up tel block. over,"
up tel block and the computer is mine.
"not yet, jack. we're still in the e-mod dump. and, aquarius, houston. o'j ;'fl )41 i)j (jbl( (jo .'_c_d, lou:;ton. (1920 )il_( (j(_ okay. we'rc coming up on time for the coarse aline, jim, so you can hold your attitude real good."
roger.
"and, odyssey, ttouston. the computer is yours. you can press on."
"okay,"
"houston, aquarius."
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
roger. he just did the coarse aline. i'm going to the jettison attitude.
copy that.
"aquarius, houston. i copied that you - that he's completed the coarse aline; he's going into the p52 now? is that right?"
let me check. i think he is.
"okay. you're staying at your present attitude, aren't you?"
yes. we'll - i'll stay in the present attitude.
roger that.
"okay, houston. i got a 220 alarm here ...."
roger that.
......
"odyssey, houston. have you set the drift light and the refsmmat light? over."
"odyssey, houston."
... flag.
you were noisy; i didn't copy. have you set the drift and refsmmat flag?
"okay, joe. i don't have a star in the sextant. i'm going to hunt for it in a minute."
"roger that, jack."
"okay, joe. can you give me any stars that i might try here?"
"that's affirmative. vega and altair should be good. vega is 36, altair is 40."
okay. we'll give that a try.
okay. and you might look for them in the tele- scope if they're not in the sextant right off. they should be close to the crosshairs.
okay. i got all that material that's venting from the bottom of the command module.
roger that.
"i have an rcs light, houston."
"okay, jim. that's the one we warned you about some time ago. low helium; no sweat."
"oh, okay."
"okay, houston. there's a star angle difference with stars 36 and 40."
"how about that, baby."
"an odd maneuver, houston."
roger that. copy you're maneuvering to the lm jett attitude. is that right? 05 20 52 58 cml that's affirm- -
that's affirm.
"i'm going to torque those gimbal angles. 05 20 5b 05 cc torque them, babe, full stroke gimbal."
there it is. okay. i'll do a star check.
"okay. 05 ?0 53 27 cc okay, odyssey. you're suddenly ahead of the time line."
"odyssey, ttouston. request 0mni bravo. 05 20 5h 06 cmp i am omni bravo, jim."
okay.
"okay, houston. the sextant star check passes."
"say again, jack."
"i did a star check, and it passes. it puts that star right in the telescope."
"good enough. you can _,ress on in the checklist, jack."
"find out lm gimbal lock, .jim."
it's the command module's gimbal lock i'm worried about.
(laughter) okay.
"aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"roger. if you concur, we would be inclined to re- commend that you go to ags for the maneuver because you'll have to be there later on anyway."
okay. 05 20 55 1;3 cc and ags pulse is the recommendation.
"we're having trouble maneuvering, joe, without getting it in gimbal lock."
okay. you can- -
"you picked a lousy attitude, though, to separate."
"well, we apologize. just take your time. jim, we've got time now,"
okay.
"houston, why cara't i stay in pgns att hold for the lm attitude hold?"
"stand by on that, jim."
"aquarius, houston. over."
go ahead.
okay. our recommendation is that you stay in a_ for the lm j_tt simply because we 'ye thought it through. we've got the right deadbands and all set up. over.
"okay. it's a lot easier for me to maneuver in pgns, joe, than it is _gs."
"yes. you can maneuver in pgns, jim. i'm sorz?, i thought you were talking about the att hold and the lm jett afterward. you can maneuver in pgns if you want to."
"i want to get way over here, joe. to prevent him into gimbal lock_ i have the yaw at about - i'd say about almost 50 degrees."
"roger that. just stay out of gimbal lock and that 45-degree isn't critical - the out of plane, that is."
odysseys houston. request 0mni charlie.
okay. going omni char!ie.
thank you. 05 20 59 12 cm? there.
okay. good.
"roger. that's verb 46. roger. aquarius, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, jim. the particular dap configuration we have set up now is using more fuel than we'd like out of system b. we'd like you to reconfigure the dap to 30021. over. 05 2 00 57 cc thank you."
"odyssey, houston. 0', 2! 0 l _,( cml' go :jjlead."
"we'd like to have you turn the optics power off until you need them again, and we would like to have you check the rcs ring 1 and 2 temps for us. over."
optics power going off.
okay.
"okay, joe. our ring 1 is 50; ring 2 is plus 42. 05 2 )2 09 cc ring 1 is 50; copy. what was tileother?"
42.
got it. thank you.
"okay, houston; aquarius. i am at the lm sep attitude and i'm planning on bailing out."
"okay. i can't think of a better idea, jim."
"i'll go to ags att hold, if you want me to."
"we recommend that, jim."
"okay, aquarius; houston. in ags att hold, we recommend wide deadband. over."
i'm in the ags deal)band.
roger.
"aquarius, houston. don't forget the ..."
"you need to relay something downstairs, jim?"
"odyssey, houston."
"go ahead, joe."
okay. our troops would like to have you go to the systems test meter and read out the injector temps on rcs for us. 05 21 04 12 cmt okay. okay. in work. tape94/8
"okay, houston. let me rcad out the injector temperatures for you."
go ahead.
"5 charlie, 4.2; 5 dogs 4.6; 6 alfa, 4.3; 6 bravo, 4.3; 6 charlie, 3.6; 6 dog, 3.6."
okay. copy that. no complaints.
okay. we're ready to proceed with hatch closeup.
okay. did jim get the film out of aquarius?
yes. we - you mean the film we took this morning?
"that's affirm. 05 21 05 48 cm? yes, we've transferred that."
"okay. good deal. jack, let me mention something about the hatch integrity check. you're going to vent the tunnel until you get a 3-psi delta-p. that should take 9 or 0 minutes, and it's our firm feeling that you don't have to wait another 10 minutes after that for a leak check. if it holds pressure for a minute or so or even gets down there, you know you've got a good hatch. over."
okay. copy that.
okay.
"okay, houston. we've got an 02 fi,ow high."
"okay s jack, are you -"
"well, we might be pressurizing a lot of the system that was not pressurized."
roger. i expect that's the case. let us check it.
okay. take a good look at cabin.
will do.
"odyssey, houston, just verify your direc? 02 is off. over."
"yes, sir. that is verified. !'af,,(:):_, 0% ;'1 i _ :_ ci,h'i ... il':; _ljr'_li_i_lr_pi__,_w_ .io,_. 05 21 13 _3 cc roger. we think that you were just pressurizing the cabin up to that regulator's particular spec."
"odyssey, houston. 05 21 15 18 cmp/cdr go ahead."
"okay. we're observing middle gimbal angle getting a little bit high. the lm appears to be deadbcund- ing okay within its attitude_ but just wanted you to know that we're keeping an eye on it and if it does get too high, we might want you to punch off early. 05 21 5 32 cmp okay."
and verify that the hatch is secured and that you are venting the tunnel. over.
that's verified. we have a delta-p of 2.8.
real good. real good.
"okay, joe. since we're ahead of the time line, can i proceed on and kind of punch off early, or do you want me to punch off at exactly 1 hour?"
"jack, when you are comfortably ready to punch off, you can go ahead and do it,"
"odyssey, houston. we just had a formal go for lm jett at your convenience. over."
"okay. thanks, joe."
okay.
"okay, odyssey; houston. we're ready for you to bring the bmags on and warm up and all other things being equal, we'd like you to go through the lm jett at - on the checklist you've got. and that is bmags 1 - -"
okay. will do.

"stand by 1, jack."
"odyssey, houston."
go ahead.
"okay. i'm reminded that the entry dap is all you've got. it'll initialize itself, and you won't have an - you won't have an rcs dap, so you den't have to fool with it."
okay.
okay_ joe. i'm - have you got your checklist out there on the sps powerup? 05 2 22 17 cc that's affirm.
"okay. i'm coming down here to a step that says fi)ai power, off. is that what you want right now, i guess_ huh?"
go ahead.
"okay_ jack. that fdai power, off, is to stop momentary gliches as you bring up the bmag to put it on, and you turn right around and put tile fdai power rig_it back on 1."
okay. and i don't have the bmag temp light out yet. do you want me to go ahead and put the bmag on with the te_p light still on?
that's affirm. we can go ahead and you'll have a good stable rate.
"ail right. let's do it. 05 21 26 38 cmt) okay, houston. we'll punch off at 141 plus 30. 05 21 26 h3 cc okay, jack. we copy and we concur."
okay_ houston. do we have a go for pyro arm?
"odyssey, houston. we can give you a go if you'll put the logic on momentarily first. ''a;_: 94/  i':_.t;,: 7)0 05 21 ;'8 )il cml' okay. t_' ;;l':cz l,o(lc is ua. 05 21 28 _2 cc okay. just copied that, and you are go for pyro arm."

"odyssey, houston."
go ahead.
"okay, jack. we'll have a pad for you in a few minutes. we're getting data now on the tracking, and although we suspect the changes from your preliminary pad will be very small, we reco_nend that you hold off on initializing the em until we get you the final pad. over."
okay. will do.
roger.
"okay, houston. the sextant star check passes."
"houston, copy. good show. that was some p52, jack."
"yes. i was kind of lucky, i guess."

thank you.
"hey, joe. we're standing by to copy your new pad."
"okay, jack. it'll be a few minutes yet. we want to get it right up to speed. tat_e94/1:?"
"okay. i can proceed with em_ check, can't i, joe?"
