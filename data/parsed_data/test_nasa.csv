dialogue
i'll write the get down.
okay. there it goes.
okay. i got l0 degrees.
and the camera count on the 500 is 61.
stay forward and you've got a go at 1.
"huh? okay, i'll give you a 4 plus 30 mark."
okay.
"okay, bob, i'm going to go down through the flight plan down through about 259:45, get this maneuver started. and then we can press on."
yeah.
"and it looks like bronte has penetrated the dark mantle in here. it got the subfloor, but there's not an awful lot of blocks around the rim - there are just some small ones - compared to what we saw around - watch it. cdr-ev& yes. yes. lmp-eya what we saw around horatio or in the walls of horatio and around c_aelot. nothing, also, like we saw yesterday at station 1. bob, that characteristic little dimple in the bottom of the craters is still with us, and it's invariably glass-lined in the fresh ones."
"all right. you can go ahead with the reading, ed."
"well, boy, i can't see. my hands work just as well as my visor, as a matter of fact."
suit demand regs to both.
roger. but i particularly wanted to let you know there was no problem with sleeping in it that night before.
...
"you know, one of the things i found worked real well was, instead of using the - the big trash bag - (laughter) - that one just got shot down - was to keep one little temporary trash bag out that was easy to get in and out of. an_ put stuff in it, and then every - couple times a day, dump that into the big trash bag."
p67 - -
"i think that's swp right there, jack."
"sometimes more, sometimes less."
"orion, there will be no pipa update. 07 07 49 44 cdr-_{ they're saying no pipa update."
"looks in to me, now."
"hard dock, houston. hard dock. o0 03 33 53 _ great!"
we'll see.
"okay, tony. we're going omni bravo and selecting - turning the high gain."
yeah.
"roger, jack."
photo 1 has ... zero zero.
"well, we - we expect that, but we're remaining flexible."
.....
okay. we'll get a piece here. l_-eva okay now_ you're still sampling the one we just got. so we'll get another one.
"roger, al."
"roger. copy. the needles did jiggle, but they went back to zero."
"okay, hadley. we'll be watching that. then, you might copy down the following steps to be per- formed, depending upon our analysis of what we're watching right now. one, if leak stops, upper and forward hatch valves, close. and ensure that the urine qd is capped. over."
*** a choice on that.
"well, there's another good one ..."
"yes. you've got that pretty well pegged, man. there it be."
"yes, when we get clear of the west side here, dave, we could just head - about 180."
loud and clear.
"houston, hadley base."
it's really ...
you look just as pretty in earthlight as you do in sunlight.
- - 90 percent.
"and on another check there, inco verified there was no problem with your configuration."
very good. very good.
man!
"okay, houston. i'm ready for battery management, and the ed bats are 37.2 and i'm going to power amp, primary, and pm [sic], high."
yes.
"i'll tell you, it's a good seatbelt design - it's a great seatbelt design. okay, let's check the drive enable. they're all on. drive power is on. steering forward to bus a. 15 volts dc. ready to go, jimmy?"
"hey, eagle. houston loud and clear. columbia was very weak. we were unable to read him. 05 05 58 36 i24p roger. we saw you come up over the horizon eagle) and it looks like you had a laser operating. could you confirm that?"
don't know how we missed that .... _-
... we have enough sim.
"okay. on the pwm select, we'd like to go to 1. and_ on the drive enables, we'd like - -"
going back to auto.
select to inverter 1.
"why don't you watch your gage, and i'm going to - okay. i'm going to open the forward dump to auto to 3.5."
- - and then a retract?
lmp frame - is 130.
for 3 you're ready for 02.
negative. we would like to stay on the high gain if we can. over.
okay. verb 40 noun 20.
"okay, and your high gain attitudes there are pitch, minus 75; yaw, 40."
i'm going to hand you the h_mer. i'm not sure that double core tube screws on as far as it should. try it again.
"and there go the drogues. and the mains are out free. oh, we gst all three."
we'll do a verb h9 to the ags cal attitude s jim.
"that's affirmative. ()kay, now we're down to ei minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the i2< starts a maneuver to what we call the moon-view attitude. this maneuver is designed to place the command module optics pointing with zero zero at the moon, and it will be flown to on the lm ball angle."
"i'm going to pull it now. 04 13 21 18 ode houston, the mesa came down all right. (t_u_q)"
okay. landing radar temperatuee's coming up. okay.
that thing's so heavy.
"look at that horizon thing, would you, you guys!"
roger.
roger.
"ken, some time when it's convenient - anytime you can get to it, we'd like to get a film status."
"just want to keep you busy, jack."
"okay, dave. we agree."
roger. are you reading tranquility base now?
wrong switch.
okay; 217:21 delete three lines. got them. go ahead.
... pilots. they ain't got ...
"hey, it's alive (laughter). cj)nfidenttal"
roger. we copy that.
and 02 fan number 2 is on.
"apollo 11, houston. we have about 4 minutes los. that makes a0s 98 18. over."
okay. it's going on the hand tool carrier.
have we looked seriously now at just the essential things required to make a safe lm jettison? we're not - i don't think we have the time to really do any engineering data that people might want to look at as this thing goes into the atmosphere.
wait a minute.
"okay. our data shows the platform's inertial now, ken."
you got them?
"17, houston."
okay. say that again now. i was checking some- thing else real quick.
"okay, endeavour, shut her down ... if you're ready."
"our distance is - our bearing appears to be okay. 06 04 40 34 i_p-eva yeah. hey, tony, you remember out in - in h,_waii those at kapoho where we saw those ve_ small little sink-hole craters?"
"we're reading you now, al."
"hello, falcon; endeavour."
"yes, i'll make it. i don't know how it's going to work when i get that geology pallet. might need a little help there .... okay, i have a flag - i have a tone, rather. - 05 00 42 48 cdr-eva i got one. i guess i heard yours."
"okay, bob. thank you. oh. (laughter) here."
"okay, and were the boyd bolt guide cups remo_led from the heat flow experiment?"
mark it. gravimeter.
copy that.
i_m stm_ding in the crater so i can get level.
... (laughter) ... back off.
roger.
"okay, on the dps burn card, third line should read cb(ii) and (16): stab/control cbs all closed, except cb(ii) aea, open; abort stage, open; aeld, open; cb(16 ) aeld, open."
we did.
sure.
- - i'm gonna turn the flows off if you want to come out of the helmets and gloves.
tell them narrow beam.
okay.
"yes, gene. if you're - if it's easy enough to take it off, why don't you take it off the rover; and we'll try and level it in the stuff."
okay. that looks good neil.
"okay, well, i think we'll get to it tomorrow. i think i might just give you a clue to our thinking for tomorrow. but, i don't think we've seen, or done anything today that is going to make us change very much from the nominal station of - nominal eva-2 plans. _e fact we didn't get the station - to the eva-1 at the large boulders at ew_ry is probably going to mean that station 5 might be shifted a little bit to the boulders on camelot. but certainly station 5 on the subfloor and also to station 10 have ass,,-_d a higher priority than they originally had. other than that i, don't think we'll see an awful lot of changes to eva-2. over."
"yeah, we're gonna break it."
"i'm ready to copy, joe."
"roger. i have that. we'll leave those two cir- (tranq) cuit breakers open, and have the up-data link to voice backup; and we'll make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card."
roger. 04 16 37 09 c_ okay; bit rate - bit rate to high.
i'm ar. how do you read?
"and 7 - - i_mp bob, let me ask a couple of questions to make sure - -"
"al, why don't you end i switch off here when ..."
"bmags, rate 2. 01 06 41 53 i24p i'm already in low bit rate."
i'll put them here in the ...
"okay, we got the attitude yet?"
rrt.
copy 45. beautiful.
nothing wrong with that one.
"just a minute. 2.6, that's a nothing."
"yes. i reckon nothing's perfect. okay, they're closed."
"mode control, both, att hold."
"okay, and we've got about 5, and we're proceeding through the checklist."
"..., yes."
"he had about 20 pounds of soil, tony, and he came up with one little frag. and it - we just dropped it."
the long can. here's a - oh. got it? it's slippery.
"houston, aquarius."
"yes, that one's right."
"america, hou - houston. we just finished a site handover. and we're seeing some excessive counts on the crv. we'd like to chase the problem a little, and to do that, we'd like you to turn the uv off for 5 seconds and then back on. over."
okay.
"- - you might check the lens; and, if it looks reasonably clean, see if you could get the bit of outcrop on the near side to the south."
"go ahead, joe."
"delta-p is open. cdr' suit fan 2, open?"
"hey, bob. *** you want covered? that's the panel. okay. you want the - the panel with the - with the on-off switch and the - and the signal strength switch and so forth covered, don't you? =.= mmammwm"
"they're superimposed on the bright ray or ejecta blanket and/or ejecta blanket system of the - of those cone, or fresh cone craters."
"houston, 15. you ready down there?"
"0h, oh, oh, oh, oh. i_{p-eva i thought i was going to get this half."
oh.
"okay, bobby. love to have you do that."
"hello, tranquility base. houston. we'd like you to torque that. over. 04 07 49 -- begin lunar rev i_"
"well, according to the pitch meter, it's not. it's pegged out."
"roger, jim. and can - can you actually see the east side of the rille, towards the south there?"
"okay, verify glycol, bypass?"
"okay, that should do it."
"oh, there it is. okay. now i'm glad we checked that."
"we got enough right now - we got enough right now, but we didn't have the reserves for midcourse. we were within, say, 1 percent of running it out of gas. so - -"
"houston, do we have a new _{ dap weight?"
"yes, until i get that up for a fit."
... (columbia)
we're venting the cabin. the vents are open.
what the - - c!_-eva the rake! l_-eva the rake?
"eagle, houston."
okay. that's all the questions i had here. at least the bugs didn't eat the particles.
"you're going to get a big surprise when you look into this head crater, al. it's a beck of a lot deeper than it looks."
"get _ little farther away, charlie?"
"loud and clear. 01 22 h6 26 cc _oger. iou were loua and uiea__ a=! she _iime. apparentij, jou just 1o_% us."
"hey, al. we want to change the dead band in p20 here - -"
"columbia, houston. we show your evap out temp- perature running low. request you go to manual temperature control and bring it up. you can check the procedures in ecs hal 17. over. (goss net 1) tape 68/3 rfilr)2 i_ 20 cml' eoger, houston. (col,ijmi;[^ )"
(laughter)
"no, we sure don't. 04 04 00 08 _ no. but, see, that retrograde burn is going to t_ke you down below us."
it must be in your ...
i can't believe you're docking.
pressure regs a amd b to egress?
"poger. 04 20 26 30 lhp okay, houston. the thumper is stowed on the i.fi_t. i had to get the first geophone out in order to get it there, but we'll take care of that in a few minut es. 04 20 26 hl cc roger, ed. oh 20 26 45 i_4p now comes the task that tries men's patience: gevting the mortar pack off. and it's coming off, now. incidentally, how much are you able to see, bf_ee ? oh 20 27 03 cdr it's in my pocket .... pocket? 04 20 27 39 m_ yes. okay .... >8° 11 confidenti - ay5"

and that's an atlantic landing site.
"*** we've got to make a place in here for your - : that full bag. *** small can over there, and core tube over there."
"i got him, too."
okay.
"note crewman in mode b, that's me, cannot hear houston. houston, broadcasting in the blind; 100 percent on the cdr."
roger. 05 08 21 28 cnp okay. and anything else before i do myself in?
"i'll tell you, at the high sun angle, it's warm isn't it?"
"okay. yes, that's good."
"then to number 2, small jett bags. and i can't get anything else into 1."
"roger. that - go ahead and do that, chariie."
"roger. columbia, was that bravo and delta roll? over."
boy.
"i don't think we're going to need a chart solution, but i'll take the numbers down anyway. ]"
"well, i didn't ask that yet, jack; stand by one."
that's a good step. about a 3-footer.
"okay, john; when it comes back to direct, - -"
"i'll go over here and nudge the - roger. he says he is getting good data now. c_ okay. c_ i wanted to be all clean shaven and - so i could be all nice and presenzable for the g_vs, and i didn't have time to shave yet."
okay. on page e6-1_ flourrrt is 07 20- your 50k is 08 16; 40k is )8 30; your 24k is 09 02; and your 10k is 09 51. 0wer.
"go ahead, 13."
"16, we're - through hawaii now. and you're scheduled in this attitude through 7 hours or - at least, so no problem thermally, and you're not even due to do the p52 for another half hour, so you're plenty ahead."
"charlie, i'll give you a view out of the over- head window, back looking at the command module right-hand rendezvous window. (goss n_'t1) tape 36/10"
"okay, at your convenience, we're ready to - watch you do it."
"no, hell no. you didn't tell me to."
"i can see australia with the naked eye and the china landmass, but i - it took the monocular to pull out the korean peninsula."
"yes, we'll give that a try, because, unfortunately, the antenna's broken right off at the root. 05 21 43 05 t_.'_ yes. - tde"
_at didn't fix it.
"oke_, al; beautiful. we can see you coming down the ladder right now. it looks like you're about on the bottom step. on the surface."
- - on the surface that'll give us a real bad proklem.
- - can you see index at altitude now? could you see any shadows to identify it?
"it was a little bit less than that. it was about 80, maybe 75."
how about that?
"h_.y,tony. i was sitting here today thinking about those rocks we got, and the thing that really s_rikes me is that there was - i really don't think we got any volcanic rocks to speak of. maybe some of those little black clasts were volcanics, but osherwise - i don't think we got any. there wasn't a_lythere. the - there was one other - one other point that could have been - those ones we were calling shocks could have been a tuff breccia, since they were so friable. but - that we might - that might prove to be the case; but to us, they looked shocked due to the other features that we saw that - that - applied a shocked metamorphism. over."
fifteen.
that is affi_aative.
"that's rock bag 352, houston."
"okay, houston; endeavo ur. looks like omni charlie's it."
"that 30 degrees is probably enough to cause the problem you saw at the start of eva-l, and we may, depending on how you do with cleaning up the water and so forth, want you to re - top-off the water and maybe the oxygen also on both plsss. we'll have more on that later. i do have a consumable update for 138 hours, when you are ready to copy. 05 18 19 14 lmp-_ stand by."
i don't remember even ever doing that.
"okay, let's get ... here."
blocky rim.
"give it a go, though."
(laughter)
"okay, i'm ags initialized. time skip"
"okay. then that - that's worked out fine. apparently we were having a temperatue prob- lem with that thing before, and we're back in business just like normal. we'd like now the _ mapping camera track to retract, and that '11 take i guess about 4 and a half minutes."
that's jolly.
get that?
roger.
okay. how do we stand on your burn card?
"copy. 07 09 21 bb cmp houston, 15."
"yes. while you're under there, would you check (laughter) - check my transmission, please?"
"okay, they're alined and adjusted and locked. 06 19 06 39 ixmp-iam 02 connectors, three?"
"ail right. i was just thinking. i'm trying to get as much weight as possible down there in that leb. we have no srcs and then our waste tank is - you know - rather depleted. i think it's about down to 40 percent or so. so i'm trying to get as much l over d as i can, and any heavy items we can get down there, i'd be greatly appreciative of you bringing it to our attention."
"okay, you ready to copy my noun 81s?"
"pete, we have clipper both - and you both on the same air to ground- clipper, go ahead. say again. eonftdentia"
"i'm also figuring that when we've got to go back in there, we'll ... take the drogue and the food ·.. back here - take these - put these back in there .... 02 21 12 53 _ hello, houston. how do you read? 02 21 13 27 imp hello, houston; aquarius."
okay. (laughter) does that embarrass you?
"oh, i was just - you know - looking around; see if i can get disoriented .... 00 o1 27 51 c_d° oh. it sounds like - -"
this white stuff on the rim here?
"143:16, by-by."
"okay, the laser is off now. the mapping camera going to standby and the image motion is coming off."
didn't go as far.
right.
"i think we can see some boulders, but there are no apparent jagged peaks that we can tell or that we can see from this - this particular altitude yet, although some of the - the shadows look fairly sharp."
yep.
"yes, stand by, joe. i'm going to get your cables; and you're hung up, all right."
"yes, it's loose, too."
"okay; in work. let's see, 287. that's a heading from dodge city to tindall. okay, 27 28, 287 right on the money."
"disconnect rcu from pga. if it's off, stand right where you are, and i'll get your rcus disconnected from the pga right here."
"- - imagine you'll hear it a couple of more times today, too."
"uplink sqtjelch, enable? 06 18 51 10 _._ ***_6le."
"loaded it? okay. okay, and those are the num- bers. hey, that's good. okay. you ready to mark? what do you want first? ..."
"yes. talk me through the solar wind; let's get it up, that's - they really need lots of data; we can give them lots of data."
"roger, jim. the p30 pad. purpose, doi trim, rcs/g&n; 38264; noun 48 is na; 095:56:42.50; plus 0003.1, last two noun 88s [sic] are 0; 180, 104, 359; noun 44 is 0059.4, plus 0009.6; 0003.1, 0:20, 0003.1; 30, 192.8, ll.1; rest of the pad is na. gdc aline stars are vega and deneb; roll, pitch, and yaw are 288; 340; 346. it's a four- jet rcs burn, and we do not want to trim any retrograde residual. so any extra burn you get in that direction, we will not trim. over."
"no, this is a nice crystalline rock."
- - is off. okay. record the delta-v c. you got that?
"well, you see the gegenschein?"
"okay, america. we've taken one last look around your bird and it's looking good. so at least your half is go for pdi."
"56, 1 minute."
"it's unlocked, huh?"
okay.
okay.
"you can't - can't fit them together. 01 08 20 ob cmp god dsmm it, there's an outlet down here somewhere."
"okay, yes. then we pick up our gloves."
... under the couch.
yeah.
"- - or autolycus, jim, but the exact position's certainly not critical. your judgment. 06 02 26 51 i_mp-eva okay."
okay.
"say again, please."
those are my tongs. do you want me to bring the other tongs?
"and - got a ways to go. we want to get the lm data kit, in r-3. okay, ac - -"
me too.
okay. thank you.
jeez!
okay.
"is that a good enough place for you, jim, right here?"
"stand by just a minute, will you? we're going to take one last long look here, but everything looks okay so far. o0 08 44 28 [md° that's great."
"okay. step 7. circuit breaker panel 11, ac bus b, helium pqgs display, closed. main - circuit breaker panel 11, ac bus b, numeric light- ing, closed. cd panel 11, ac bus - is that ac bus b? bus tie inverter 1, closed?"
"okay, it must have worked then."
okay. we - we copy that.
"okay. a to recei¥_, b to off; mode, ics/ptt -"
yes.
"okay. on 7-6, delete ""eva debriefing with houston,"" and delete ""eat period"" right after it."
"what are you doing, hot or cold now, stu? 03 15 47 o] cdr he's doing the hot down chere, ed. 03 15 h7 oh i2,_ okay. see if i get anything hot. yes_ thare's a hot. o] 15 47 50 sc (music) 03 15 h7 53 cdr those g_ys actually sell ar.yrecords of zhat stuff?"
i'm not sure if they have any of our beverage packs or not. i think they are all packaged in these expandable little things we're using for water - water cans.
"and, houston, 13. were you reading us?"
- - these things.
"go ahead, jack."
let's - let's press on to the - -
thank you.
"yes. that's - we'd - they'd like it so that thai.- the axis of that lineal cell was - would be para]- lel to the bottom of the panel 100, as an example. it's prob - right now, it's perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100, isn't it?"
"and, at 247 plus 50, we want to move the ptc initiation steps from 247:30 to 247:50."
"okay, dave. we copy. good description. we'd like a bag number from that, and like for you to move out at your next opportunity, please."
coming up on 20.
i can't even - wait a minute - i can't turn around far enough to see it.
roger.
"want me to sep for you? you leave that switch open. i'll give you a two.potato count, sep. and then, i've got my other hand .,. these primary propellants."
and we got 1106. (ta_q)
"ron. the intensity of the last one i had was - oh, a fourth of the bright one i had before that. tape _6/2"
and we're moving about l0 clicks.

...
it is.
"okay, we copy that."
"okay. thanks, vance."
"do you take credit for that last zero, two? _v_ and after that, vhe lmp tries one. _p (laughter)"
"no, don't look, we got too many - too many things going bad for us to look this time. look after the burn. get right there and then you get ... phewl"
"we're about ready to lose comm here. you're look- ing great, guys, and we'll pick you up in hawaii here shortly."
right.
okay.
"apollo 15, houston. over."

okay.
"oh, the probe. yes."
"mark. and, ken, just turn the cameras off there. then, before you continue on with those steps, i want to say something about those procedures on down at the bottom. i'm showing 6 - 7 seconds."
"oh, look at that blue."
okay.
sunrise is - -
"yeah, which way you want it to go?"
eecom says the heaters are on and that's the normal load.
"go ahead, endeavour."
okay. copy that.
"looking good now. cm_ looking good, yes. see that's what we needed."
"no, it's probably bigger than a silver dollar. 08 22 09 46 immp i bet at arm's length it -"
...
that's right ....
"roger; we copy. 03 09 59 55 cpip and, hank, i got some - some film status to give you, if you're ready for that."

i'll not try vo have them off at the time he says zero.
"hello, houston; aquarius."
"you're right; same old food. (laughter) i'd recognize it anywhere. (laughter) i ain't sure where that is. we're at - we're los now. aren't we?

"you know, the crater dawes has got - starting from the top going down the rim, there's a kind of a light-tan layer, it's a concentric layer that goes all the way around; and then you come into a lighter - it's almnst to the white and it looks like on the hills and all around the landing site. and this first layer goes down maybe - let's see, as you look at the total distance in there, about a third of the distance; and then the white layer - concentric layer that goes all the way around, and this is in the western wall i'm looking at now, and it goes down to - to about a half of the distance, not quite half of the distance from the top of the rim down to the bottom. and then the lower port_oa of it, the lower half, a little better than a half really, is kind of a tannish gray - has a tannish- gray albedo to it. it's all streaked. and close to the bottom of the layer, the bottom of the crater itself is - filled with - well, oddly enough, it's the same color of material that's - that's laying around the edges of the crater, it has some radial rings around it, which gives an indication of a subsidence of some kind, or a sliding down the hill. _at's really the first crater where i've been able to see any sort of layering in the walls. now the first layer on the north side and also on the south side, in the dark brownish layer of the thing, you can see parts that are jagged, jagged, and sticking out. in other words, there's a slight change in slope in it. that looks like it's a very steep slope, which would indicate that it's a fairly con - compacted type of material in the first layer. and then the slope changes in the white layer on down a little bit more. and the white layer seems to sort of combine and maintain the same type of slope as the dark-gray stand - layer - the bottom, or from halfway down to the bottom of the crater."

"okay, we got them. i don't know what they're advertising down here, but on one of the big screens here for the science group, they've got three, four signs put up now. it says the ""marines are looking for a few good men,"" ""united states air force is a challenge for the bold,"" and ""fly navy,"" and ""stay in school."""

"well, i guess that, immediately, i think of the - the orientation or organization that was revealed in the side of mount hadley. there's 14,000 feet vertical relief of vast mountain face exposed to us. and there was layering in there that was most impressive for the total 14_000 feet, and we com- mented on the number of beds we could see. that really impressed me, that you could have that much organization in - on a large mountain on the moon."

"also loud and clear on ar. cdr-l_ okay, jack, squelch vnf b, full decrease."
"hey, good! let's hope she keeps going."
"houston, 15. go."
"scb 2 for the big rock there, jack."
"about close enough? ,confide l"
i don't think we ought to fire anymore.
"we have been hearing you, and the problem is on the ground. i hope we have it corrected now."
"oki, jim."
that tape up there - on the reel.
"okay, 413."
- - so press on.
"close. 00 00 28 24 _dp okay. here, let me get you started on your optics."
roger.
"okay. now, we are working on sample bag - 10-b."
"okay, verify eva circuit breaker configuration. 04 17 28 09 i2_p okay, let's go circuit breakers."
"- - you're a - -1most a - just a crescent earth, just a very sliver out there. and i tell you, we can hardly wait. i know we got a couple of things to do before we get there, but we're looking for- ward to it."
yes.
"yes. fan's back on. i have good flow, joe, -"
hey.
"right. we are going to shorten the eva by about 8 minutes, is all."
okay. put it on. 35 000. l0 04 30 16 _ she's on.
"okay, i've got mary and franny and nancy - and donna - and bobby and - -"
engine arm to close.
"roger. you're really smoking along, aren't you?"
... yeah.
roger.
"take the other one, too?"
"houston, apollo 11. how do you read high gain?"
okay. i'll - i'll do that now.
"well, now. don't get too carried away up there. 05 ll 49 04 c59° (laughter) no, i would really - i'd really hope they make it to north ray_ though. i think that's going to be different than we expected it to be."
"oh, okay."
"i got day 5, meal b."
(laughter)
"okay, tony, let me describe what it is. the top centimeter of the regolith is gray, and you get down under that, and it's white."
going to be _]tunt end[ forward .... changing around. 03 15 50 23 c_ d:l_.they charge that:! 03 15 50 22 ijp yes. 03 15 50 28 cdr 03 15 50 33 c_® i wonder why in the hell they waited until now to do that.
"charlle, this is houston. whatever you just did up there got the coolant loop flow back. we'd like to watch it for a minute before proceeding. over. 00 00 19 15 _ okay, we're at step 12, page 2-13, configuration now with radiators at bypass. we've got the - the reservoir bypass, open, and the outlet and the inlet _,closed."
he's always thinking.
roger. we'll have a word for you in just a moment.
no.
"yes. we don't have to do any burns tomorrow, which ·.. me ..."
"okay, vance. we're in data and po0 and the circuit breaker's in. go ahead."
... audio.
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
yes.
"and, houston, jack's going to try donning his suit now for practice, himself, and when he gets it out, we'll give you a dosimeter reading."
i do like to hear those things go. very nice feeling.
"... 2, 3, 4 ... okay, now, in a minute, we're gonna - -"
"here's something here. go ahead. i want to look here, for a second. 05 12 36 34 l_ if you look real closely at the rock, the surface of it is coarse pitted and there's some pits that are maybe even up to three-eighths of an inch in diameter on it; however, most of them are small. it doesn't look like a basalt, although the grains are too small for me to see anything - identify any specific one. some of the pits have glass in it, which is not too surprising_ and many of them don't. that's about all we can say about that rock, houston, and that's typical of the - of the ones in this area."
very blocky.
good. that's a good rock.
"sure was. 05 23 51 29 cd}{ everything worked perfect. ok_, here they come. right side forward."
yeah.
"you got it in your window yet, dick?"
yeah.
okay. what else do you have for me?
- - 9?
huh?
roger.
... like a p30 pad. it'll be okay.
"okay. we recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the cmc-computed angles for your auto maneuver."
... we're _lmost to sep. we're about 50 meters from sep.
and the pan camera power is coming on - 05 21 37 27 cml° mark.
"aquarius, enter on the 203."
"okay. cg is in lm/csm. 03 13 h8 32 cmp gimbal drive: pitch l, yaw l, auto. pitch and yaw in auto."
"okay; houston, falcon here. would you give the endeavour a call. tell him we're going to run the radar checkout now, please. we seem to have lost contact."
"roger, ready."
arid we want the dac f/k and 12 frames per second.
okay. how - how many minutes you got to go?
okay.
"okay; there's verb 43 - enter, plus 00250 enter, plus 00333 enter, plus 00333 enter, and the needles pulsed out and right back to zero."
"okay. thank you, sir."
he really didn't mean to just fly over to 280 roll.
"ed, are you reading houston? doesn't look like ed's reading anybody."
okay.
"gordy, we're pressing on, but if you've got any good words, like news and what have you, where we are, we'd appreciate it."
here comes the lsmding site.
the old geophone cable caught on the corner.
"roger. verb 74. 07 06 0b 24 cc okay, the first flight plan update is the - at 174:12. 07 06 03 b7 cmp okay, go ahead. 07 06 0b b9 cc okay, where it says the ""mapping camera laser ex- periment covers, open,"" et cetera, et cetera - de- lete that."
"oh, okay."
okay. we'd like you to disable b2 and d2 just for a drill here.
"okay; get in your corner, jim; i'll get you from the rear. turn around and get in your corner. go back to your little corner. oh, my."
"and, houston, we're doing an 02 purge on the fuel cell, presently purging fuel cell 3, and i'm getting a fuel cell 3 caution light."
right in this little - it's only about a 4-meter depression.
okay. p_ camera power is off.
"that's it, all right. we got it. 09 03 26 0b lmp just got it going over the sill."
ish.
i don't want to use the same one i'm doing; see.
"ail righty, ken. sounds real interesting."
"roger. you have it. and readback tei-19, sps/g&n; 394h5; plus 0.61, 1.15; 111:31:49.81; plus, 2909.4, plus 0785.3, minus 0224.0; 181, 100, 017. sirius and rigel; two jets, 17 seconds; burn undock, assume eirc; lm to at t. minus 166.09. lg"

why don't we have our helmet and gloves on? when we going to dock?
"okay. it must be unlocked, charlie."
.. coming through ...
okay; we're standing by.
i don't think so.
"and we knew all the time, dave. we should have told you. wanted to keep you honest, though."
"you know, apparently you made some comment earlier in the day about being bothered by comm noise during your egress from challenger. did that go away right away, or did it just cease to bother you, or what - what was the story on that? cdr-i_m i don't remember; so, it must have gone away, be- cause the commwas great."
right.
"roger. don't want to forget me. we're just watch- ing everything; we can't find anything wrong, so we're just trying to keep quiet here."
"go ahead, joe."
"it appeared locked to me, but it just came sailing off of there."
oke.y.
"okay, it's about, between 30 and 40 degrees."
it's on.
"yes. i got it. 00 00 49 30 imp okay, eps monitoring check's complete."
mark.
"i'll mark that down to remind you. and, jack, you'll be glad to know that the temperature of the backplate there has already dropped 20 degrees - 20 degrees."
"okay. same old proble_n, huh?"
"we're at spur crater, joe. 06 01 26 46 i_4p-eva i'll give them the shadow device, too. okay; the heading is 290, 349, 7.3, 4.7, 095, 100, 82, 90; motor temps are both lower limit."
"apollo 11, houston. coming at yea with the p37 block data. over. 00 _0 59 28 lmp okay."
yeah. flml mt 4

- - at the second depress.
go ahead_ houston. this is challenger.
"... worked was when i moved it. that's possible too, when i took it off that sound could do it; that may have bombed it right then."
go.
"stand by, gordy."
- - in 3 hours.
okay.
"*** by, dave."
be advised that - just dropped the bags.
h2 master alarm.
okay.
feels like it's trying to drive.
thought you wanted to go back to the moon?
leave it.
"okay, houston; falcon."
is it?
"okay, m - on my merk, it'll be 05:30."
go ahead.
this.
"140, 4200, 195, 74. 00 00 24 _6 l_p g°od. d."
"okay. it's 278, 295, and 310. and the high-gain angles are pitch 11 and yaw 330."
"what's the closure rate now? three and a half feet per second. okay, all i've got's the tracking light; i've lost the rest of your image."
"that was a good tv show you put on the other night, fred, during lm entry."
"and we've copied the 93s. you can go ahead and torque. cm_ okay. we'll torque at 11. 10 09 32 09 _vr° okay, the ir cover is open."
"houston, apollo 11. could you confirm that pitch gimbal motor number 1 turned off? we just shut all four off, and we got a question- able indication on the ecs on pitch 1. 00 04 41 01 cc: roger. stand by a second. 00 04 41 22 c_ houston, did you copy our residuals? 00 04 41 2h c( apollo 11, this is houston. stand by, please."
"eagle, houston. would you have columbia go to the high gain, yaw 0, pitch minus 20. over."
"well, i did. how do you want it over?"
okay. how are jack's ekgs and stuff. he's going to tape them now.

okay. lift vector's up (cough).
negative. just wait for 30 seconds.
"houston, this is falcon again. biomed, right and lo bit rate."
t_at's a new one.
it's got a mag.
yes.
"oh, okay. thank you much. 06 16 49 xx begin lunar rev 39 cml° well, let's see now."
"hey, ron, how do you read? how do you read, ron?"
say again.
"cabin gas return, egress. verify."
yes. i got to get - sneak by over there. whoops! don't shuffle too much dirt in there.
... steady this ...
boy howdy. that ...
"jack, we missed your last transmission - -"
"okay, good show."
"roger, fred. thank you."
"11, houston. looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. we'll have you a pad, of course, the next rev or so, and we'll keep you posted on tei. looks like nominal time. over."
"roger. o! 06 22 57 cmp don, could you tell us if - if the delta-v c number you gave us includes any kind of a bias tc compen- sate for the minute of f2_s on t--meprior to ignitior_?"
seal the sample in your bag.
"13, houston. loud and clear."
"... zero phase, ... of which is 4, 5/6ths, let me - that would be - that would be ... 4 5/6ths."
...
"okay. and as you walk by there, if you walk by in the right side of the rover, how about giving us a sep temperature read-out, please."
"well, i don't know. man, i never even saw that thing until all of a sudden i turned around, and there it was following me."
"okay. when you come off on aos, on the next rev, rev 15, we'll give you go or no go for another try. _d we'd be looking at pdi on rev 16. and at that time, we'd have pads for you and procedures. over."
"and, ed, are you having any better luck on the triple core this time? 05 14 26 25 imp i've got it in about half a tube. but i'm - getting ready to take a picture of it, so you can locate it; then, we'll go ahead and drive it the rest of the way in."
"tell you when you get to 2.8, dave - distance - i'll let you know."
is cabin holding? 05 22 22 28 i__ i don't see any flow; it had been holding. it hadn't moved.
"..., dave?"
okay.
"houston, i can even see poppy right where we're going to set this baby down. matter of fact, i can see rudolph. i can even see the triangle: rudolph, frosty, and punk. man, gordo, this is absolutely spectacular! we could watch ron track - we could watch ron track right on through the land- mark. i don't know what kind of results he got, but he sure had a nice smooth track from here. cml° beautiful results."
okay.
"jack, this is houston."
"okay, geno, cmc auto? let's see what's on this star here. kalinan [sic] - menkalinan, i guess. okay, earth far horizon; 23, enter 120, enter, 25 enter ... (coughing) (singing) plus - 7073 enter, plus 70644 enter. okay, that is the unit vector of the star."
"okay. we'll talk to you in the morning. as soon as the cabin is pumped up, you're go for sleep and you can turn voice back off, at your convenience."
"bob, i wish i could give you more on that structure in there, but i think those lines of boulder sources are about all we can see right now. talked about the lineaments yesterday and they're not nearly as obvious today in the higher sun. looking up wessex cleft - even with the sun in the flat area there, it looks darker than where - than the north massif side. but again, the sun angle may be fooling us but as i recall, it was darker on the photos."
"okay, ron, at 211:08 delete the lines: mapping camera - off, wait 30 seconds, mapping camera - standby, image motion - off, and laser altimeter - off. delete those lines."
roger. copy.
"okay; that makes sense. i guess we've got one point here, and looking at the postignition sequence on the l0i burn. in order to monitor start tran- sients and retain al's capability to take over in case we have a gimbal hardover at start or something f like that, perhaps it might be better to push that circuit breaker, the sps pilot valve main a, closed, as soon as we get ignition. and then that would enable a1 to get back over in the thc in case he's got a problem there. how about that? 02 ll 17 04 mc% okay. we did discuss that a little bit down here about that time. we felt that we'd like to have the - the engines stable out - stabilize out to guidance sad the engine on bank b before he even goes over and tries to get that pilot valve cir- cuit breaker in. that will give us visibility on - on the dme dump on how bank b is performing."
"jack, we can't center it up any more, because the side hatch is only one part of the aot. the rest of that blackness you see is really space."
go - go ahead and ...
"okay. okay. oh, this is so much fun. i can jump up about 3 feet and do a - 180. you might do a - 360l"
"yes, ... 8 hours ..."
okay.
"okay, let me get around to the other side of you. it's a little hard to zip. this is one of the hard parts."
"ah, yes."
"okay. 06 ©4 41 13 lmp-eva that right one's the same way, i don't know how i ever got the one locked yesterday."
"boy, they sure make them tight. okay ...."
"okay. everyone agrees to that. don't hurry and smear them (lmughter). i'll get those others, jack, tomorrow."
"okay. it's shaking the ground. number 3, houston."
"i don't know, charlie."
yes.
... he's got the lens cover off.
that's affirmative.
"casper, houston. would you give us the high gain just as soon as you can and go accept."
i don't understand that.
"dave, we also need the tv c_meras turned off at this time, and see if you could brush the top of the camera with your glove, please. it's getting very warm. i'm sorry, that bad input - -"
"all right. very good. thank you. o0 23 ll lh cc okay. (goss net 1) tape 15/4 o0 23 ill09 cc 11, thi:_is houston. if you are interested in the morning news, i have a sun,nary here from pao. ()vt!r."
"rcs indicator, switch to cmi and 2."
okay. 05 15 44 54 _p okay. purge valve.
"bob, we'll -we'll drop challenger right on th__ south massif for you - for your birthday present."
another thing you've got to check in getting this thing on is maybe procedures.
i will in a minute. you can turn it a little bit towards me. okay; 312. and the soil outside the overhang will be next.
- - third ... there ....
but i have a p in the vent window.
right here.
"okay. and it looks good, babe."
pull - hold me a little bit.
"i'm sorer, bob. i guess you - you didn't hear it. i - we're !_assed the *** the antenna and we're headed south or north - northeast. *** screw you up?"
beautiful.
"11, houston. for your information, those two entries are an update to your delta-h that we have already uplinked into the cmc. over."
yep. yep. 07 00 52 21 _p-eva - - the sky line on the far ridge.
"hey, houston, if you read, we're reading you. got you all the way through the trunnion on sextant star."
"yes, that's yours. 07 14 09 02 lmi° let me get that."
"okay. off/reset on range, and downvoice backup on voice."
"no, 30 at a mile, 20 at 3."
"you don't have to have your glove on - but you can have your helmet on just to keep the crud out of your eyes, prohably_ 07 04 16 16 _v_ yes. bus we don't have anything in the procedures, do we?"
"glad you remembered that, tony."
here's a couple of sneaky bags first ... this one.
it's safer that way.
yes.
i'm going to try to get him. if we're still in attitude.
roger.
"i'm scrry_ j2m, oust - just take the last one, %hat a b - oop. 05 22 29 53 i2'd2 oep! san you dc it? 05 22 25 55 2dr that's good. i got it. okay. canis%er going down. okay, toss it right here. that a boy. okay; other can is down. a jett bag. i mean, the bslss bag. 05 22 26 14, ii_ yes."
"okay. on page ll3, i've got a dap load for you."
"oh, you went through this all already?"
"falcon and endeavour, this is houston. evidently, r neither of you are reading each other. we'll stand by until you get overhead and give it another try. i'll give you a cue. over."
okay.
"yes, okay. it's his water flap."
"that's affirmative, gene. that's the changes to the loi limits cue card."
"okay, and we'd like a verification from a1 that x-ray is in standby and x-ray/alpha covers are closed before jet and sep burn. -- 07 09 04 37 cdr okay. we'll get that for you when we get squared away here."

"okay, houston. challenger's at 2 minutes and 50 seconds."
"okay, at 06:30, should be at 30,000."
okay; let me put the bootees on here. okay; purge valve is locked.
...
"pete, go ahead."
two and x.
plus 00800.
144:59 at 5 minutes.
"houston, orion."
"okay. all right, i didn't hold it in that long. maybe 2 or 3 seconds is the longest i held it."
let 's go.
"houston, what page is that on in the lm systems book?"
"hello, apollo 11. houston. we're wondering if you've started into the lm yet. over."
and i'll go back in to switch. okay.
roger; you're 5 by 5. and command module did no_ reach circ. and we're standing by to - for y'al!'s decision with him. over.
"well, bob, i've already got it on."
roger.
okay.
"okay. these will start out in the flight plan, here. and, after lm je%'2,we'd like you to proceed with the activities that run on the original flight plan from 177:30 through 178:01. so that last _ entry that we will be doing will be the line that says ""x-ray, on"" at the very top of that next page. after that - during that, though, we will delete at 177:53, the line that says ""mapping camera/laser experiment covers, open, talkbaek, barber pole, then, off, center."" it's the second line in the block at the bottom. you got that? 07 11 56 56 _ okay, understand. we'll delete that particular line, ""mapping camera/laser experiment, off,"" and we'll do all the activities up to - through 178 there, the mass spec x-ray, on."
"that's the best focus we've got, gene°"
yeah.
roger. go ahead. (tranq)
i think there will be enough light in the cockpit because it'll be daylight.
let me carry one of these -
"okay, let me wait until after this landmark track- ing here. i'll write her down though. (humming) ... in there. 5725 - okay, give me a call shortly before t-1 and i can start my clock."
"no, that's not correct, fred. what we waist to do is leave everything the way it is on 311,and add this one comment i'm g_ving you at the - at the bottom of it. 05 09 2] 17 lmj' oh, okay. okay. i misunderstood. okay. go _jleadwith your added comment. 05 09 _1 ?2 cc return to ""entry lm prep checklist."""
"let's turn it around now, jim."
how'd you make out?
cmp first. yes. _they've gotten it. yes. then me and then you. i'm just reading you the proce- dures is all.
"okay. we'll be standing by for that, and now power am3't.71fierswitch is going to go off, and then we']] be going to down voice ba(,nfup. 05 o0 l_639 cc okay."
"oh, no. we've got a good handle on it, karl. thank you."
go ahead.
"from an astronaut's point of view, i'd - i would not feel qualified to discuss it, other than to say that if language is a problem, i'll be glad to learn russian. i think charlie and ken feel the same way."
okay.
cb 16 inverter 2 open.
"okay, challenger; america. i'm through with all the pads now. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription 04 12 o1 b5 cdr-lm hello, houston. do you read challenger?"
sorry.
roger. stand by.
...
"you're welcome. l0 18 14 33 lh_ doesn't look like it's going to make it, does it?"
"oh. yes. we're losing all of it now, aren't we? 03 il 25 56 _4p you know, that - that sharp crater back at chaplygin was rather phenomenal. next time we come across there, if you get a chance to see it - it looks like it's been draped around the rim."
okay.
"yes, i read you."
it has been awhile.
"yeah, i don't - i don't think there is any of it in the suit loop to amount to anything. looking at charlie, i can tell where most of it is."
"brake (laughter) - easy, john. man, are we accelerating. super. i should have had the camera pointed forward. hey, tony, that was at - i think it was 170 at 4.4, that little steep slope there. whoever said this was the cayley plain?"
read you loud and clear. how me? 06 19 50 44 _' loud and clear.
pressure's coming up good.
yes.
roger. we copy and we agree.
you speak.
"going - yes, it 's egress."
"- - couple of hydrogen %ai_ fans to chanse ,and _he good docs would like _o hear how you're ca%ins and pushing pills,"
"okay, houston; america. i'm with you now."
very good. thank you.
"jack, we've been having comm dropouts here on this omni. have you swing around on us?"
- - looks good.
"roger, jack. and the next one is over at 89:03. we've got a comm attitude."
"as long as they're getting the picture on the omni, i guess there's no hurry to - that we get the high gain up."
man!
okay. i just wanted to pass on an ops pressure we owe you. that's 2000 psi.
"no, i can't - i can't reach it, charlie."
"the third. yes, next trip. you're right."
"okay. after ""pan camera - standby (t-stop),"" add ""gamma ray, deploy; pan camera, off (msfn cue)."" and i don't know whether you can squeeze it in discriminator, high."" up."
- - ... ops is in the way in the back here. see if i can squish down here.
"okay. fine. and before you turn it off, there, we'd like a complete read-out."
"no, i haven't."
"okay, jim. we've come up with a comm recommen- dation which we hope will save some power by powering down the power amplifier, if it works. and i'd like to read up the steps to you and have you think about them for a minute, and we recommend trying it before the first yaw maneuver. over."
okay .... let's do it again.
okay. just as soon as we get ken on comm.
"okay, apollo 13; houston. the moon has been in and out of the - the - our screen here. right now it's off at the bottom side, but we can still see the particles coming off of the spacecraft."
"well, i - that's why i asked. that's one that i don't - -"
"mine, too. is mine in work?"
there's no way to do that ...
go get my antenna.
okay. it'll pick up to 15 degrees.
okay.
"and, stu, check your dap, if you haven't already."
"okay, falcon; houston. observed your cycle back. we're going to have to rerun that first star again. 04 09 35 58 cdr-lq yes; roger, ed. the reason i did that was because we need to stick an erasable load in here on the noun 79."
"oh, boy. it's starting to get a little stiff. oh, they came off. now, they came off. oh, ho, ho, ho. okay. doff helmets, with visors. here i'll get yours for you. turn my way, if you can."

"no, i'm going right - right about here. now i'm done."
"- - ri_to. then we need to m_nually roll clock- wise 40 degrees, and i have here p20 data for you to get the sharp end forward. ._ 08 19 28 57 cmp okay; we're rolling, and stand by t until i get a pen."
"okay, we'll copy that."
yes.
okay; i'll have to check that myself. we're on rev 25. he's about three-quarters of the way across the front side. coming up back side will start 26.
"i':inot sire _ like it, but -"
"just out there on the slope. i guess if you saw a crater ... you might look at that, but primarily we're looking at the crater."
"pu shift. 00 00 08 26 cc 16, houston. we saw the pu shift. thrust looks good, and you're go for staging."
"okay, over the top. minus - o8 23 53 38 ct_ ..."

what's wrong with the tv? aren't you watching it?
roger. did you get a chance to look at f crater?
we sure are.
"well, we got lots of cr - okay, most of the craters here are - there's another split one, but it - -"
okay. understand. was the checklist written back- wards on that?
"roger, 17. we copy that."
okay_ you can give me the revs 40 to 45 and - until charlie gets on the comm. over.
okay. real good. we just won't - ... won't be the right attitude. we'll use the verb 29 m_neuver and use that attitude.
okay. i'm sorry. i misinterpreted the words there; i should have gotten that. forget that one.

okay. sounds good.
we're all hanging out.
"boy, those rates look steady as they can be."
"well, we just floated down there, ken. it's so easy. (laughter) oh, gosh. this has really ruined me for this. (laughter) 00 00 42 17 i_p okay, purge line heater is off."
"roger, gene."
"and, jack s houston. it'll be 100 seconds on that."
what?
how long does the medical take on the ship?
just tell vance i got cartoons on. he'll know.
okay.
"let me try that. okay, that will stay in there"

"okay. that is go. well, no it isn't; it's high. okay."
do.
"well, all i know is i got that needle."
"houston, apollo 11. how do we stmld on this 02 fuel cell purge? you want to go ahead and do that as scheduled in the flight plan?"
"okay. read you loud and clear now, jim."
"well, now, that might be glass covered. that might be a glass coating, the way it sort of hangs on the outside there. ***."
"and just a reminder to use scs for that, i guess you got that down as a standard procedure now."
"okay, you want cabin's at 4.8 now; repress is about empty. okay. no, not yet, it's still getting a little bit."
"roger, ed."
"look at that rock over at - oh, 1 o'clock. it's _-_ right - well, it was on the horizon; like kind of a pedestal. tape107/8"
okay.
"yes, i'll get it. and we want one over on the other side, wherever the other one is."
yes. we might.
"no, it's green."
"okay, ron, as you're going through the test, just a word on that ems test 1. it is not normal for the zero - .05 g light to be on in entry test mode 1. it is probably a result of that drifting accelerometer. it's - we'll have to just wait and see what the rest of the test looks like."
"okay, falcon; endeavour. i'm getting some large updates on you there, dave, on the first mark."
"okay° western union employees have announced agreement on a new contract that will end a nationwide walkout that began june 1. the 17,000 striking workers will go back on the job wednesday morning. the lockheed company lost two senate vote - votes today in its attempt to avoid bank- ruptcy by obtaining a $250,000,000 government loan guarantee. in sporting news or further sporting news, the oilers traded jerry levias to the san diego chargers in exchange for two linemen, defensive lineman ron billingsley and the 300-pound gene ferguson. the oilers will use ferguson at offensive tackle, it says. and, finally, the minnesota - minnesota vikings lost the services of starting guard jim vellone when the doctors revealed that - that an undisclosed ailment would require long-term extensive treat- ment. and that's the end of the condensed news page i have in front of me this morning."
i'll let jack help you with that.
huh?
"okay, pete. i got 45.9 feet."
let me take these pictures.
yes. it's pretty solid. it just wobbles a little bit when you fire a thruster.
"okay. we got steps 6 through 12, but step 7 is the same size as 6, and 8 through 12 are short. they're only one line each."
okay. bag 426. any chance of getting soil under- neath that now for the control?
"when do we get the 210 up, jim?"
ail right. turn it off; i'm watching the waste right now.
roger. and how are you reading us?
...
roger. that's what i'm gonna try.

oh -
real fine.

thank you.

"roger that, jim. _on_,yauc_, (revl)"
okay; go.
yes.
"okay, sounds good and we'd - would like - after you've done that, we would like to go through a procedure of our own while you're on there."

ail righty.
roger; copy.
"we got the earth in the top of this thing. that was a y, jack, do you concur?"
okay; let me get your straps with the tool harness.
there's something screwed up on our burn attitude. we're not getting the proper readings on the ball and the needles are centered. i'm not too sure what's wrong. let's go through this procedure again.
if we could get going with it - we'll have to put everything in the same bag. it's a freaking mess.
"pete, you've been out 2 plus 40, and the pacing one right now is al. you're running around 20 minutes behind. and when you can, we'd like an _u check, and if you'd give us your 02 readings?"
"see how - when you're coming up at low altitude on these mountains, how - how striking they are in the distance? it's really hard to miss any from such a long ways away."
yeah.
hanging in there. batteries are looking good; they picked up all the load. battery compartment's looking good.
"endeavour, houston. one other thing, if you don't have it already, we'd like to have the s-band squelch, off, so you'll realize loss of signal. over."

you better smoke this thing over; i don't know what the freak it's doing.
"stand by, fred."
this will be a - this will be a test. if it holds - holds until we see it again -
america is on her way again.
it's sort of like - they're always there when you need them.
*** to go to the alsep.
"and, during the high-q portion of the flight, the alfa meter, to my knowledge, nearly went above 25 percent."
"okay. i'll get you a bag. and, it looks to me like the best thing to do - would be to - scoop the side - scoop - scoop the center where the glass is. oh, what a beautiful sight. you know, we're a long way from the lm. at least, we can see it."
"houston, 17."
"okay, ed. thank you much for your help."
"yes, i'm at my relief pressure now."
that's why you don't leave the gimbals running for 20 minutes at a clip.
what was the acq time?
"yes, that,'s affirmative."
"gordy, do i have it straight, that it, apparently, it's a problem just in the leveling commands, or is it - it is receiving other commands, is that correct?"
"trans control power, on."
"here you go, al."
"..., ken."
"this one, the big one?"
"endeavour, this is houston. as you go around the corner, all your systems look to be in good shape."
"oh, that would be nice."
which way are we going? 03 10 10 30 imp we're going this way.
i think we should get some more.

this one right here?
"america, houston. i have three one-liners for the flight plan."
"no. 05 04 04 44 l_p-eva try it. this is a great way to do it, leaning on this shovel. it might go in the bag, john."
i want to get a pan before we leave back there.

just checking.
roger. say again what that figure plus 02 was?
"okay. we're going there now. lo 08 46 lb cc okay. and we're watching the cabin pressure. it's steady again now. l0 08 46 19 k_p okay, pete. it looks about like where it's been to us. we think it's been hanging a little bit below 5."
"that's affirmative. and the damping is for both entry and exit of ptc from here on out, except that final one, which is coupled just prior to midcourse."
"no, i was going - no, go ahead, if you're using it. i was _ust going to give myrtle a drink. 03 15 59 44 ii_p i_m going to give me one, too. oh, hell."

"hcuston, ant_es. how do you read?"
"i got to take a couple of more pictures at that contact slope over there. i know - you can't see it from where you are, jack, but i guess we got to leave. otherwise it would he nice to sample that dark stuff up on top."
yes. t_mp-eva - - and the light material right on the rim?
roger.
okay; it's off.
i'm sure he's listening.
"bey, there we go."
you did?
"let's take it, bob."
okay. there you go.

"we - we have just one question, the lm tunnel vent valve. we're questioning why we're venting until the delta-v is greater than 1.7 if we are going to open up the tunnel, then pressurize the lm usually."
"okay. the next change is at 146:18, on the next page. 146:17, really, where it starts there with ""gamma ray shield - off."" delete from there through ""image motion - off."" that's delete ""gas_4a ray shield - off; mapping camera - off (t-stop), wait 30 seconds; mapping camera - standby; and image motion - off."" at 146:24 there where - in the block for msfn updates, we won't be giving you a mapping camera photo pad; instead it'll be a pan camera photo pad; this is just for your information, and it'll be copied at 148:10."
i thought you were close to henry.
you can torque them.
we're going to get a master alarm here.
"okay, that was a good call. i can't - how long have you noticed that, gordy? do you know?"
"all right, sir. thank you."

wait until you see how many i'm going to see in the last minute (laughter).
roger that.
"roger. and, i was so busy talking, i forgot to cue you on the gamma ray boom. i trust that you have started - you got that out yet, or did i talk you out of thinking about it?"
"09:ll, dick."
"okay, jim; and it's your computer."
"okay, you're there."

"yes, it sounds like it. okay. after ""auto igni- tion, pro at tfi greater than 7 - greater than 0 seconds,"" insert ""delta-v thrust"" - did you mean a or b or do you mean a and b? normal?"
although i can't see how the mantle in here could -
okay. what do you want dope to the ***_
"roger. i didn't catch your readback, fred. 05 08 _4805 lmp oh, okay. the last item was item 9, and that was bat 2, low volt, off/reset, then on. 05 08 48 _2 cc roger. after that, i gave another one. bat 2, iiivolt, 0ff/reset, then on."
"okay. i guess you're right s ken. 03 20 31 48 cml° we're pretty busy, as you knows jim: and sc i_d really appreciate it if you could talk me vhrough whatever steps you want."
okay.
okay. let me help you.
"houston, apollo 1i. another noun 49 for you."
"you need - you need - you need fine displays if you're gonna fly something like this, and tell us beforehand."
okay.
you happy with it back there?
very good. we're almost there.
"()kay, i just want - -"
did you see that engine burn?
"i think i'll turn it on at - probably - oh, look out the window, and you see iona - ionization."
"okay. say when, ken."
because they just show up as gentle depressions.
"ed, this is ho_ton. i believe we're up to date already on you."
"37, 38, 39, 40, 41- -"
- - to leave these all like they are. i think we can stow them just as well that way.
"endeavour, houston. do you read? 04 02 27 h6 cmp hello, endeavour - houston, this is endeavour. loud and clear."
"endeavour, houston .... you read?"
"well_ we can do it down there, too."
"okay. ti 04 13 24 27 cdr ron, you got the word? you can update our state !' vector."
"i know that's a bad one, but you know that's about all i can do for you today. that's probably safer than having you tell me jokes."
"and the high gain angles for stowage - or for stowing - are pitch minus 52, yaw 270."
"yes. you don't expect it. oh, yesl okay. okay, lift the ... away. oh, we got - we got a little time. no - there's no big rush."
"dave, this particular crater sounds more and more interesting to the people down here. and i guess _-_ the next question is what - was there anything about the crater, its shape or anything else, that would lead you to think it had a different origin than most of the other impact craters?"
go ahead.
"houston, america. i can give you the old cmp's medical log, if you want to do it."
nope.
i guess so.
put your head back here in that little old cubbyhole.
"okay, primary s-band power amp closed now. how do you read?"
"and on the stellar camera door, how far out was it?"
and that's all i've got. we want to remember to get the pu valve to decrease.
"yeah, it's all -"
"roger. mark the uv. okay, and the ir will be off on your cue."
"okay, fuel's running a little low. it's running about 165. coming up on a minute."
yes. this one has that
"- - let me just get the pressures and then the tanks and the quantities, because i have to copy them all down."
"okay - okay, there's the data. it's reading all right in h-dot, but it's changing data in - in the next two registers."
one -
"yes. that's verified, isn't it?"
shaking the couch (laughter).
"yes, you must admit we ... sinking feeling. well, i was sure they were gone, because i swore i felt them go."
"well, i ain't gonna worry about our lousy filters. what difference does it make? they don't weigh l0 pounds. ""side of a-8 in a bag."" l0 07 54 38 omwp that's all in a-8?"
roger.
in an environ - -
go ahead.
"okay. the computer is yours, jim."
"okay, jack, and the weird configuration we're sitting in now is we have the hatch installed, we still have the probe and drogue inside the command module, and we're going to stay in this situation until you - kind of give us an okay to reinstall the probe and drogue."
"no, let's get your last circuit breakers now."
yes.
"we're entering that now. verb 21 noun 0 - noun 01 enter, 1456 enter, load 0314 - 03141."
"yes. here, take that one .... another few minutes ..."
"but i don't think it really knows. but _he _sfi_ really knows. 03 07 13 29 lmld houston, 16. it appeared to us thaz we go_ _: auto shutdown."
"unstow temporary stowage bag and give it to csm. unstow tsb, temporary stowage bag?"
"... yes, let's do a little better now."
"okay. sps thrust, direct on."
roger; we copy.
"okay. if the king is there: mahaba al el-ardmin. endeavour elaykum salam. [hello, earth. greetings from endeavour. ]"
yes.
"okay, copy that."
looks like somebody's been chipping up there. lmp-_ta looks like there's been a geologist here before ils.
"yes, a verb 41 noun 91. and i'm on vox now. get the commander's light. (laughter)"
...
"yes, you did. it's locked. okay. l-8 ia l day5 cc - - 74 - -"
"how are you doing up there? 06 19 45 h3 _mp-lm oh, just fine. we finished eating, and we're ready to don suits now."
"ron, it's time for pan camera t-stop time. cp_ okay. thank you. ***teen 24 - 05 19 38 38 cglp now. okay, went to standby at - whatever i said now. (laughter)"
that's sure towards the moon.
okay. we're getting them to work it. we will need a second pan in the area of the penetrations there.
"okay, i'm fanning too much, huh?"
0kay_ houston. how do things look to you down there?
pro. pro.
"we can see a point on the terminator now where we mentioned we saw a lava filling and some domes in a depression which is not the circular craterlike depression; it's a big cavity. and now, i guess, as the sun angle has changed some, we can see where the lava has apparently spilled over a scarp into a deeper cavity, which is in - in shadow. and it's very clearly a filling of the cavity with two levels."
"well, i - i left the azimuth on there and leveled the camera and put the earth in the center. how's that? is that - -"
okay.
"that's right, that's what they just said; they don't want that one."
yeah.
pull it and let go. isn't that the word?
"and, ron, how about the high gain?"
"no, this is chuck lewis. charlie duke is out with flight getting a weather briefing right now."
"roger, is that 2 bravo, fred?"
some of those inclusions get to be bigger than the size of a baseball. there's one here and a couple up there.
"okay, forget it."
"okay; and the problem here, we're seeing all the carriers, but we don't get proper modulation, and so we're just not getting the right data."
okay.
enable.
"no, vacuum hose - vacuum brush, it says. 10 07 55 30 cml° ..."
we have a hunch that the setting might be in peak but we recommend average on the alc if you haven't got it there already.
"now, that'll give us plenty of room down there, that - yes, i just don't want to interfere with the steering."
"say again. over. 01 12 0'_38 lmp roger. are you ready to copy som_ numbers on the status report, et cetera?"
"man, i could see that thing - light of yours at 70 miles on the telescope, even."
"hold on a second, and i'll copy those. but there's a flight plan change in just a few minutes i'd like to get to you. the mapping camera image motion, which is scheduled at 120:10, we'd like to have at 120:16."
"that landmark tracking worked out real easy, huh, richard?"
done.
"yes, i am. the rille is just coming into sight now."
"go ahead, bob."
"now let me bring this camera around. to commemorate apollo 17's visit to the valley of taurus-littrow but as an everlasting commemoration of what the real meaning of apollo is to the world, we'd like to uncover a plaque that's been on the leg of our spacecraft that we have climbed down many times over the last 3 days. and i'll read what that plaque says to you. first of all, it has a picture of the world. two pictures, one of the north america and one of south america. the other covers the other half of the world including africa, asia, europe, australia, the north pole, and the south pole. in between these two hemispheres, we have a pictorial view of the moon, a pictorial view of ' where all the apollo landings have been made so that when this plaque is seen again by others who come, they will know where it all started. the words are, ""here man completed his first exploration of the moon, december 1972 a.d. may the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind."" it's signed, ""eugene a. cernan, honald e. evans, harrison h. schmitt, and most prominently, richard m. nixon, president of the united states of america."" this is our commemoration that will be here until s_neone like us, until some of you who are out there, who are the promise of the future, come back to read it again and to further the exploration and the meaning of apollo."
unless we could go over in the lm and do it.
"okay, we're going through the sim door-jett checklist, and i've got here a - a list of verifys - i'm on page 1-7, step 10 - and it has sm/ac power on, and - and we haven't been on. with your con- currence, i'll go ahead and turn it on now."
i don't think i could have run that mile in that ·suit ...
copy ... - -
"aquarius, houston. that's affirmative."
"okay; let me check off. off, off, off."
"okay; copy that. you might want to put the big bag on the inside of the pallet there, if you can't operate them."
stand by for gimbal motors. 03 06 38 52 cml° i thought i just gave you one.
roger. step 4. connect lm h20 to plss h20 fill.
i've got it. 04 23 53 00 i_mp-lm and i'll pass you the lec. 04 2b 5b 02 cdr-eva okay. let's see; i certainly don't want to hit that neat little round rock down there.
"omni bravo, houston."
... want me to turn this ... to comm ... - to turn this on?
where's the exer-genie?
okay.
okay.
"nev_ orleans, fhoto on station. three good chutes"
not according to my needles.
"well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have _ou."
wilco.
try slowing here. there's our trusty drill.
"15, this is houston. we find an hour's passed now, and we thank you very much for the data, and there's a general question. since the counting rate was less than previously, is there - - is there any impression that you have that the inten- sity may have been less than previously; also, the intensity of the individual flashes."
yeah.
... or just let it drift?
"boy, that's a great song. what the hell's the name of it?"
i had to put it on to get rid of it.
"go ahead. go ahead, houston."
"okay, let's - -"
that might be a good idea.
okay. the mesa brush is there and the map is there. 05 il 35 25 cdr okay. here we come. 05 11 35 h9 ij4zp *** close that.
... never have gotten that ... down .... 28 inches? i had to ... strain to pull the ... down .... - -
"okay. once you get it out, can you put it back on?"
"it's very fragile. that's right. it's very fragile, and i double bagged it. i don't know whether we can keep it or not."
"okay, now let's put in that thing."
yes.
there you go.
where's that other mag?
good.
you're going to need it.
"eagle, houston."
"okay, i got the down-sun. man! that's a hard moon."
"okay, 153 on the attitude."
okay; go ahead on up.
the switch can't produce an ignition signal without something else producing the ignition signal. it sounds to me like the light circuit breaker switch.
yeah.
four balls 1.
"well, just the general thing that they pass around after a - a day or so, i think, is the time frame they work in."
i just relieved the watch; just thought i'd find out how things are going.
"okay. hey, listen. this is a pretty good size - i don't know how big this ray is, but the sample on the west edge of it (laughter). i don't under- stand how we're going to do that."
"that's affirm. yes. it's the - the only 4 on that page 24 and it's a- presently has after it rcs system a/b-2, quads, 4, to auto. under that put - - 05 09 05 3_ lmp roger."
"... computer, because -"
"okay, mark it. in one minute you go to suit circuit' relief, auto. lmp-_ okay, suit - watch your ears."
"roger. and at 246 plus 46 we want to add ""change discriminator to low."""
okay. we'll do that.
off.
"want me to repeat that program alarm? okay, program alarm reset."
"okay, verb 77. 'we've got good signal strength."
direct 02 is off.
okay.
there's plenty there. and i'll wait for your words on that. and the watch is wound.
i think they got a lot of that dust on them.
"that's right, so he should screw with his. it doesn't have anything to do with our transmitter. since we always hear him, - -"
that a - -
mark.
"john, can you see - is my thing leaking right now?"
"rendezvous radar to slew; slew, two of them, are open."
okay. we're moving. sort of.
"that's affirm. we'd like it out, and then bat 2 on the line."
it says we're there.
"okay. we're standing by for 5. houston, challenger is go for lift-off. we're at 7:54 and counting."
"go ahead, jack."
roger. angles 146 and plus 29.
"no, the - the hook did not come back with the handle. the hook did not come back with the handle. although, when i - when i pulled the handle back to - you know, which is - which is kind of a nor- mally uncocked position - and then it wouldn't go any further, you know. it wouldn't go an further. and then the latch itself - or the hook - the j-hook; i'll call it the hook. i moved it off the docking ring back to this position that was about an inch or 1/2 inch from the docking ring. and it stays right there now. and i can't push it back up into the docking ring at all. can't push the hook back up to the docking ring at all."
try the pressures on both rings? they still okay? okay.
"yes , i know."
"one of the more unusual features is developed - as i see - developed in the southeast pacific just north of the ross sea and that is a very striking mushroom pattern on a very large scale. it has north/south clouds streaming streamers from the ross sea. and when it gets up about the latitude of tierra del fuego, but quite a bit west of that land, it branches out to the east and west in a iarge mush-room pattern. and, it looks like the top of that mushroom may be a curved cold front that's pushing its way up into the southeast pa- cific. it currently - the eastern edge of that front is probably l0 degrees longitude from tierra del fuego, and it looks like that land in southern chile is picking up high clouds, probably associ- ated with that front's movement."
okay.
okay. that's one of them.
"the lineations down here cross the - no, i don't have a big enough chart to cover all this. but they just point right up toward imbrium. this transition between -"
"okay, bob, our 524 is what i think is a blue-gray rock probably breccia. it's got a little dust cover."
yeah. 170.
"good show. 06 07 51 45 lmp-_ you know, houston, it would sure be handy to have something like a false floor to lay down in this thing, because we sure can't stand on the ..."
"thanks, bob. just going to give them a call. hello, falcon; this is endeavour."
"okay, and you want bag 2 under the seat?"
...
"okay, now. onfidenti.a _."
"copy that, geno."
...
okay.
"no, there isn't any bag under there now. i got it right here. it's 7."
"and, america, you might be interested to know that the latest span status report stis1 lists all the lm ecs par_neters as normal. t_ beautiful. span's up to their old tricks again_ i see."
"okay, houston, hf antennas - going to extend, n_mber 1 -"
"that's what it says. it's unstable in all scs modes on secondary servo. i can't believe it, but i'm watching it. every time i select the secondary yaw gimbal, any excursion with the thumbwheel causes it go unstable."
okay; press ahead and use the gas. go to a higher rate aud let's get these things.
"you know, i figure we got almost exactly a 100 hours. as a matter of fact, this ent - this orbit entry, or - entry interface, is at - 291:30 - huh - 294:43. it is now 194 and some."
roger. read you and clear. (manq)
"hello, aquarius; houston. do you read? over."
yes.
*** sounds like all of them to us.
"okay, 13. we've got lots and lots of people working on this; we'll give you some dope as soon as we have it, and you'll be the first one to know."
looks like you can see these blocks in the walls of that little crater. looks like the thing is gonna be pretty blocky in the regolith.
"dave, could you give us - -"
"to the north of that - to the north of that bay of mare. just interrupt. 0b 15 38 09 _ hey, i just saw a flash on the lunar surface!"

"houston, this is the lmp - - tape 72a/%"
okay.
"okay, i'll take some of that out. that means i go to the south, right?"
...
and we go to the timeline book.
just a little piece but that's - see -
no. it'll keep it in.
"roger, pete. we copied that."
"and it's on, and locked, and locked verified. lmi°-lm i may be learning how on these, finally. okay. mine's on and locked. if i can get my black band on here. i think i'm learning how, geno. crazy. like a trained band putter onner. okay. i feel pretty good. need some help?"

okay. and the rover ... should be fairly flat for the ole gravimeter.
"we're through with the lm umbilicala, i hope."
"all rieht, sir. i think that sounds like a good plan."
roger.
okay.
i'm very comfortable.
"yeah, i'm gonna do some scientific research on this thing with my little pen - _less some dingaling give me a ... pen ...."
"oh, good!"
"hey, hank. i 7 _', 5_ 3c cc go ahead. 07 03 36 34 cldp how about giving me a call about 5 minutes before we pass over the landing site and about 5 minuves before we hit the riphaeus mountains."

"roger. next, csm cb lm power 1, main b to open."
you have auto.
how's that for coming down gentle?

yes.
"okay. i copy that. probably just three samples then will be sufficient, then."

is the command - service module still venting?
okay. i have these numbers if anybody wants them.
okay. water's on.

"gordo, it's called education of necessity."
"0kayl, we're going downslope now, tony, about a 5-degree slope, and we're going to go down perhaps 50 or 60 meters before we start climbing back out again towards palmetto. and up around north ray, we see two tremendous blocks at about station 11 and ]_2that appear to be black in color, black with white spots. and there's a - we're just about out of the ray material now. we only see a few cobbles left."

"charlie, i forgot to put in the aux circuit breakers over there. push it in."
"jack, just some words from the back room on you. the a - there may have been an impact at the time you called, but the moon is still ringing from the s-ivb impact. so it's masked any other - would mask any other impact. so they may be able to strip it out at a later time, but right now they don't see anything at your called time. 03 17 56 05 i_p just my luck."
you're clipping a little bit. say again.

"okay, ron. how do you read on alfa?"
"okay, houston; 13. we're a little bit ahead of ourselves. do we have a go to do the fuel cell purge and the waste water dump?"
"got a big rock there, too?"
"yes, that's the one. i verified that. numbers? okay."
okay. stand by.
"yes. that may be my first and last time though, jack."
and we'll talk and set it up so that ...
"i think at 0.7; we are starting at 4052. hey, what should our bearing back to the lm - bearing and range be back to the im, tony_ when we hit that crater?"
"sure did. we copy noun 62, and your orbit by radaw is 95 by 90."
"- - start at the 195-hour page and we'll jusv mechanically add 2 hours to everything on that _age and run through it as - on the _a_e. o_ay? _he change that we originally had jn the flight plan, which i read - i don't know vd_ether it was to you or to - jack, which moved t? e group f'rom 196:20 over to 196:30 - will still mow} over te 196:30. so, that will stay as is. arid, agalr_, that will be, of course, at 198:30, then. i)o you understand what i'm saying there? over."
ocps. it's breaking apart on me as i pick it up. i'll try to get most of the pieces.
sixty - 60 for al.
go ahead.
"let's see, i must be looking back at - well, there's swp. golly, i don't know. i 'm looking back at the complex: cochise and shakespeare, and i can see the lm."
intercom t/r. loolo4ll ¢_ t/r. 1001 o412 cdr ... l0 01 04 lb cdr off.
"okay, now, ken. this is just a couple of words on dealer's choice. now as you recall from running this in your attitude, right here at about 172:13, your trunnion is down through about 22 degrees. a_nd, of course, there you were going auto. now they tell me the way you had been flying the scs tape !01/24 rendezvous, that you'd just stay in an att hold and let the trunnion. if you want to here, you could put the pitch bmag to rate 2 and just bang it once. but i - i'm not gonna give you any - any changes of flight plan on that. that's just your option on how you want to keep the trunnion angle."
"okay, ron. we're here."
"used a little gas on that one, didn't we?"
"bob, you said 185/1.57 l_2°-eva what do you want7"
and a lot of that boulder is - a lot of that outcrop down on the bottom is boulder.
... now ....
that's right. it - they - they - -
"number 9, houston."
okay.
okay. let me know when you're going.
go ahead.
"man, that booster's something. couldn't get over the ice. that was something when the ice came off."
"take the cap, right here."
"and, falcon - -"
okay. that - that's what we ...
"hey, good. we can say that's because the guys went to the moon, see?"
darn it. right there.
"time for stuff that you want to feed through to the iai,prior to - lift-off?"
okay. c02 select to primary. c02 light goes off.
and we're setting on frame number 25 on mag xx - that's xx ...
"hello, john. how do you read? 05 08 57 34 cdr-i_i loud and clear. how do you read? over. 05 08 57 37 ncc okay, john . while you're eating, just let me pass a message on to you. that, number 1, you guys did a beautiful job there today. we're real happy with it down here. tony told you the plan tomorrow is to run a full 7-hour, and our plan beyond that is to give you a little longer day than usual tomorrow. and the following day, run a third eva for about 5 hours, then go ahead and launch the rendezvous and try to hold you to about an 18-hour day total, which means hang on to the i=mand go into a sleep cycle. so that's kind of the master plan at this point. tapei8_/19 03 08 58 22 cdr-i_4 okay. fine."
... make a pair?
"okay, let me make sure here."
really nice.
"oh, i suggest - - 03 17 19 30 _ ... better get going."
okay. stand by.
"okay. on panel 5: cb central instrumentation power, main b, closed,"
"ron, just for your information, we're not going to give you a tei-49 pad or a state vector this pass. we're going to give it to you at the beginning of the next pass. we want to refine our data a little bit."
"oh, yeah."
ckay.
"go ahead, houston."
"thank you, sir."
"columbia, houston. we copy. thank you."
and it was right out here by the drill.
"when you combine them with the limited area that you have to look in because of the lm reflections, you find the telescope to be very unsatisfying."
"okay. you say you have a place like that, jack?"
okay. okay. and i see the other one - let me parallel that line.
roger.
"yankee clipper, if you'll give po0 and _ccept, we'll ship you up a state vector, a target load, and a refsmmat."
ro_ler.
"okay, how's your master volume? you happy with it? or should i jack it up some more?"
okay .... give ... a call.
"cabin reading about 5.7 over there, dave?"
"536. l_p-eva squash it - crmnp it a little bit, if you can; a little more."
... 21101.
"yes. that's what we're thinking about, too. you want me to do a quick p527 it kind of looks like - we've been talking it over, and it kind of looks like we'd probably aline our plats - lm platform with our platform and then power down the cm, and keep the lm powered up doing a dps - whatever dps burns you give us?"
they don't believe me.
"ail right. hey, that's a couple of neat-o rocks. 04 22 42 36 imp okay."
"okay. let's start on the business. you say put the probe in, huh? i'll probe and drogue ... probe and drogue ..."
"oh, i'm sorry, jim. 05 02 4b 20 lmp-eva ohhhhh. got it. 05 02 43 24 cdr/lmp (laughter) -eva"
i think _t's going to be close enough.
"okay, we're looking at the drawing here and see where you mean."
no.
- - was never closed.
"oh, they're okay. i'll take it."
"we're ready to - no, stand by."
okay. that 's better.
"we'll put it in our activation book. let me find -',::c:.,.;;i. ::l'c_':;zf;c,j;olis.y;o_ :d , _t _ no,."",:,i '::.iv(i; :r_ f , iaxp let me find the right page. _c , :::rogez,..... _........ ::rev -_'_u:._.i -aa4,j;_c.k.'th,_, _gm_u_r'rsyours. okay. lm dip-'inf6_t_6n: l_ weight, 36714; . csm weight, 380_8. l,l _c :,-,"
"okay; i thought i heard your key. okay; in the inner portion of orientale, as we approach a ter- minator, the lighting is still excellent. matter of fact, it appears brighter than what we were looking at over at copernicus. now, part of that may be we're seeing much sharper relief since the slope - earth-facing slopes are nicely lit, and the backfacing slopes, of course, are in shadow. the first portion of the bench inside the rook mountains is partially filled by mare. now, the higher land in there is very smooth, in a gross sense, is a very smooth hl_mmocky terrain, cut by roughly circumferential grabens. the trend of the hl_mmoeks themselves are not radial; they're more - well, they're about a 45-degree angle to the radius. they, in detail, have a much finer hackly texture, much like we've been able to see on photographs before. and, in general, you get the impression that, in several areas here, that that hackly tex- t'mred surface is draped over material that resembles the massifs of the rook mountains themselves. there's one area just to the north now of our track where there's a large, roughly equidimensional mountain mass, with a few projections of massiflike peaks through this hackly textured surface."
"okay, have a good meal."
"and it doesn't look like it took, pete."
right down here. 00 01 05 b8 lmp right.
"15, houston. you give us a reading now on that?"
i'll get them.
"hey, pete, how far out from the moon are we now?"
"al, would you do a verb 66 for us?"
"okay. stand by, joe. let's - i'll give you a call."
you're 30 seconds to t-start time on that pan camera.
"oh, it's zero. _gp-eva oh, you got to get off anyway?"
"oks_, gordo, we're on the top of 8-h."
yes....
b/d roll.
... 07 02 56 4_ lmp-eva is it on the ops?
"okay, we'll stand by for your call."
roger. how about the barber pole now?
"yes, i know it."
(laughter) i never would have guessed.
"dave, maybe the best idea is just to use the agc technique."
38. i went at 20; you went at 30.
okay.
17 - -
let me set the gnomon down - -
"houston, 15. go."
"okay, i'm gonna stick that up here right by 305, because it's ... 07 22 24 45 imp ..."
"well, i'm not sure because we picked up a number of different bits, and then we dropped it a21."
"16, that was so garbled we didn't copy, so you're gon_a have to say it again."
roger. going back now.
they're off.
roger.
i'm surprised you didn't have us tape two headsets to the snoopy helmet.
"flood should be in, and asa in on the second one."
"that's correct. now reader panel 8, it +ells you to ""close all circuit breakers except,"" and i have four additions. the first one is cb service module rcs heaters, quad charlie, main b, open."
"good readback, ron."
there's that little thing that comes off.
"tge is on. 22 - oh, you just want the last ones. okay, 07. z"
that's what it says.
"roger. we copied the first time. if it's okay with you and looks clear, we'll command the yaw maneuver."
roger.
okay.
"okay. oh, yeah."
it might be part of trident.
okay. stand by.
"yes, sir."
"hey, you really ought to get them a cup of coffee though sometime this morning."
okay. give me the book - give me the boo - - 03 23 33 35 imp i'll read it to you; i've got nothing else to do.
that certainly is beautiful.
"3, 2, 1 -"
"roger. we verify that, okay, aquarius. trim it to 7.6."
"freak, you can run and - -"
"m_k. flash, a - a light streak in the left eye, starting at the center going to the bottom right from upper - from upper - center down to right in movement."

"is it not - these days, can everybody put up a - -"
and locked?
"that's affirm, - - 06 03 42 24 l_p-eva - - ... the pictures."
okay.
"okay, houston. the amp-hours on - amp-hours on number 1 say 125, and the amp-hours on number 2 are off-scale low, and the volts on number 1 are 85 and the volts on number 2 are off-scale low."
"oh, no. let's d_ that, i saw them as you go out, and then i forget about them. _dr-eva yes. okay, yours is on over here. probably a better time to do them, a_yway, rather than when we go out. okay, let me get the be_. i'll get the other one when i configure your other side. okay, you're on. okay, want to get m_ plss straps? then i'll be cleaned up_ and then i finish your other one when i configure your other side. okay, you're on, okay, want to get _ plss straps? then i'll be cleaned up, and then i finish your other side. l_-eva let me get the other one. warmer out here today. ·.. on the hands, okay."
roger. understand. pete says to tell you that you'll have some time on the beach in samoa to thaw out after this cold experience.
"i'm not sure it had much effect, but we did it."
"okay, houston. hey, that's mighty fine. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay. the get was 100:08:56; and the csm, 35975, 10818, 35995. the lm, 30009, 28836, zip zip zip zip 4."
huh? well_ it goes from here all the way up to there.
this one is *** yours.
why don't we ...? ... freaking tired ...
okay. i may have jumped the gun on you there a little bit. but i thought we were supposed to do that just before we went aos - los. i think i did it about a minute before.
"roger, c_riie_ 00 00 07 _2 cdr inboard shutdown on time. o0 0o 07 _h cc roger; inboard."
"come on. guess what? beautiful, charlie. 05 02 o0 55 l_-eva okay, that one's buried too, tony."
yes.
"apollo 16, houston. if you'll bring up your vhf, simplex a, we'll do a voice check with you about 5 minutes after we configure the ground."
"bob, it's capped."
"roger. and one other question that's up there is to check for the stratigraphy reported earlier of the light gray-white layer below the top, if you see that exposed anywhere."
"stand by 1, charlie."
"tacquet up to bessel e or men - tacquet to menelaus. go right along the pass. calderas change at c_nnon(?) rilles. across - 2.8, isn't it? 1/250. the terminator's there."
i'm going back to adjust the mesa.
"okay; the big rake. well, i think i'll try - -"
roger.
yes. let's rake a look at the thing here.
"no, actually - the trenching tool, medium - ne, the medium-size scoop is the best. ail you've got to dc, is cu_ the surface to the depth of about a centimeter in an undistrubed _rea here - where we haven't kicked up the rocks. okay? 04 21 45 35 13? okay. *** bringing the stuff over fight now. probably have this done before i .., - - $4 21 45 h3 cc a1 and ed, this is houston. we show about _!_in- utes remaining until you should be az the !..sisa to start closeout. oh 21 45 51 o_dr okay, we will be able to bring _:,he_om_rehersive ssumple at that time. oh 21 45 59 cc beautiful. 34 21 46 o0 il,if hey, here - don't close it; here's one in here for that. oh 21 46 04 cdr };nat? oh 21 46 05 i2_ here's one in here i picked up. }t 21 46 06 cdr oh, okay. dump it in here, then. oh 21 h6 21 ,qdr okay. good. 04 21 46 35 2,{p okay, i'll start over here ia this undisturbed area. ih 21 46 45 cdr yes, just get that area and then right here in this area. and fill up the bag lo the line. and i'll head on back a little farther and get a football-size rock. v4 21 _6 _7 ll_{p okay. iconfideni! .'aio,"
that valley off to the left.
"pro. okay, let's look at poo now."
"america, we see your cabin at 5.5. cmp-cm okay, thank you. 07 17 06 04 cmp-_ direct 02 is closed."
"and charlie, i'd like to say hello to all my fellow scouts and scouters at farragut state park in id_lo having a _ational jamboree there this week; and apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes."
"s-band transmitter dse, group 1, open."
sure does.
"no, that's - -"
"you'll never believe it, but i saw lightning flash down there too. i don't know. that last rev. did you hear that?"
"not yet, dave. we're working on it."
"roger. understand. (tranq) (goss net 1) tape 66/21 - 04 07 22 0 cc tranquility base, houston. _f you have not done so, please close both fuel aud ox vents now. over."
how many?
"and, dave, you're going to be close to 279 on your heading, and i'll fine tune that in a minute."
"okay. ready, go. cross off a."
i know it.
"okay. recorder is off - not heaters. radar is off. data system goes back on. high gain antenna power to on. and we're about minus 44, i guess. and select the old high gain. there we go. reacq *** auto. *** in narrow. inco's going to do some commanding. *** goes. tape motion is going. continue on here to the sm/ac power. okay. sm/ac power is on."
"hello. how'd everything go on the back? 05 23 25 48 cml° oh, we got a lot of very dim photographs."
"go ahead, jack. i - cal tech will never forgive me; i'm a little hesitant on my elementry optics. but i just put ron's polarizing filter in front of the monocular, looking at the earth and rotate 90 degrees, and from max to min in terms of brightness, there's a remarkable change. and i suspect that means that the earth is polarizing light enough to see it. the main thing that happens is that the oceans get considerably darker when i rotate the filter towards the dark position anyway. the continents don't seem to show any obvious change, but the oceans and the zero phase point darken - oh, i would guess by a factor of two in brightness. maybe that's an extreme, but i think it's that."
sounds good.
"well, thatts a note of encouragement."
s-band aux tv to off.
i'll do that.
...
"well, fortunately, si_ sup didn't see fit to work us out very hard today."
i'm up to 105.
"barber pole, l, 2, 3, 4."
"0k_y, you're 5 -"
"hey, tony, we'll fillet for you - sample for you up here."
okay. go ahead. tape186/4
okay. go ahead.
okay.
"okay, let me get my scratch pad out and i'll copy those first."
understand.
"yes, joe. we did, and it kind of looked like we might have had a little stratification because right after we put them on, we had a cryo press light."
"well, i can't ..."
"oh, what a nice little machine. parked on a little downslope, but at the heading you want, and i guess ed's satisfied with the tv response, huh?"
"okay, we copy that, and you have enough consumables to go on a long time. we just feel you've put in a good day."
"oh, i'm sorry. okay, now hook a left. no, not through this crater. (laughter)."
"... yes, take these a little bit later."
okay. we copy.
you can't hardly read them in the sunlight because they don't have enough contrast to them. they're so bright.
... these two right here? ... it's real hard; you just got to really pull.
roger. can you see neper from there?
"okay. - 01 05 02 18 cc endeavour, houston."
"which one did i hand you? 06 22 08 06 l_p-eva no, i know 60 was the top one."
"houston, endeavour. if you're copying the dsky_ you'll see residual as .2, .2, and .3, so no trim."
"that's affirmative. at 165:10 - 10 - add csm experiments/eva checklist, solar corona sunrise, page x 2-11: magazine s-s, magazine h-h, and a note to perform only the camera configuration. we'll give you the times on your next front-side pass. 06 20 11 06 cml° okay. what do you mean by you will give me the times? the start times?"
"lineal word, i guess, is the - -"
roger.

"(laughter) okay. took a seconal last night, arid i'm by the h2 fans."
okay. let me get the pictures.
where? up on the thing? 05 23 17 20 i_-eva yes.h. up on the - handtool carrier -
(laughter)
"just like the simulator, you can move your eye position and the star moves. isn't that beautiful? okay. for y."
no good way to get to that ...
"remember, it's in your contract (laughter). well, thank you. we enjoyed it."
it's okay.
"yes, the fender cut - dug under. see if you can straighten it out."
but it's still an a.

"yes, sir, you better. you'll lose you ..."
"okay. go ahead, karl; we'll take a look at it."
"roger. we have the s-ivb in sight, and it looks like it's 500 feet or so away."
here's r. does it belong there with all that stuff?
"okay, gloves, four; helmets, one so far. lunar boots; hell, we didn't bring any back. 06 02 46 17 i_mp ..."
i'll give it to you.
"go ahead, jack."
"well, i'm afraid the tape has had it."
i broughv that - i brought it up separately.
"well, it's about 50 percent. about 385."
"okay. this may be a stupid question, but do you have any idea what the frequency of it was?"

"okay, fine. let's - let's not do it now."
"oh, i know what they did, ..."
"that's correct. okay. the next is the comm_d module rcs activation, and that's step 4-1 of page e/l-6. 05 06 32 13 cml_ okay. the next is perform csm - or cm rcs acti- vation for step 4-1 of page e -- e/l-6."
in work.
that 's what i'm doing.
"okay? yes, we can go to fill. we got 600, 700, let's see - -"
roger. i agree with that.
okay; stand by 1.
yinus 2.0. minus 2.0?
mark.
"if you'll wait a minute, i'll be able to get it."
"hey, ron, that frantic call there was because the sun had started to get in the ir and hadn't really thought that would happen, but started to see it get in there. but you caught it in time; the cover saved it."
see if i can get out of your way a little bit.
"tweak complete, houston."
"17, houston. we're ready for spinup."
roger.
"boy, you sure get heavy at 5, don't you? okay. where are we? right here, huh? what that was -"
"roger. better, mike. we're reading you now about four-by. no voice at all with you earlier. let's stay in this configuration. eagle, are you in voice mode? over. 04 02 26 22 i24p roger. eagle is in voice mode. how do you read? over."
"endeavour, we need wide beam for 5 seconds and then narrow."
minus 04:40.
you like that?
"okay. the time on the lm preentry procedure is just as soon as you finish midcourse-7, or 5 hours -"
"no, sir. i just got tired of looking a_ itl that's why z'm going to do the next one."
"oh, i got ahead. it depends which rev you want to talk about. on - well, i looked at her on the first day, right after doi, there wasn't any - there was two craters, but no rays. when i went back and looked at him on landing morning, there's a slight ray. but north ray still doesn't stand out as being the bright guy that south ray does."
roger. (tra_q)
"sure. if we get a single, we get a single out of it."
_..
"that one's right over there, i believe. isn't it? taat's an old rounder one right there. see what i mean? >7° jlifidential"
"copy that, gene - -"
thing looks level as can be to me.
"okay, ... 07 07 53 49 l_p yeah. 41 by 77. okay. we need a verb 48, john. there's some food. did you get a verb 32?"
okay.
okay. we've got 6-1 out. go ahead.
"jack, we want to get a good scoop sample here. maybe can we get some of those little fine pieces of glass around."
okay.
"i can see it occasionally working, jack. it's the mag. i see it blinking."
"what am i supposed to do, stand - well -"
whenever you can.
"okay, houston. they started at minus 100 on the null bias check; 30 seconds at 118.8."
okay.
"you know, as we move out from the moon, i think that by looking at the varied szructures on the sufface, that we can see from here, i 6uess n'/ impression of it is that the hoon may k;e4 uii!ion years old plus, but it sure had a - an2 i% may eventually have stop}ed growing s._%er the first 500 million or changing dynamics_fly, like ttte earth changes, but during that first 500 million years, it was certainly busy cause it reail? has a lo% of variety down there, and we haven't ev_,h beg'or_to scratch the surface of mae cc:l - complexity of the stet%r. that's my persona_ o_inlon."
okay. copy that.
the lm canister's in the pocket.
"yes, that's right."
- - it had us last night.
"apollo 16, houston. we're showing your cabin pressure up around 59. recheck your 02 flow. o0 14 42 55 _ roger. it's off."
pressures are looking good in the rcs.
"houston, this is apollo 16. how do you read on vox? over."
i don't remember if it was that station or not.
"no, i'm afraid i won't be able to say anything about kapteyn. we're past it now and at this high sun, you can't make out much of anything. he's a little too far from the groundtrack in this attitude to comfortably do when you're scrunched up in the corner of the window. and i guess i'm looking almost straight south now. boy, there's one set of peaks that stick up down there that are really huge. stick up over the horizon, make it look like the andes."
okay.
"make sure of that, charlie. ace performance on backing it out of - i think i'll just go right through here. this shorting plug's dimmer."
okay. pan - okay; stand by. i'm so dusty.
"roger. we have a tei 30, sps/g&n: 36691, minus 061, plus 067 135 23 4149; plus 32020, plus 06713, minus 02773 181 054 013; na, plus 00230, plus 32833 228 32625, 24 1510 355; na three times, plus 1103, minus 17237 11806 36275 195 04 52. deneb and vega 242 172 012, two-jet ullage, 16 seconds; horizon il-degree line at tig minus 2 minutes; sextant star visible after 134 50. over."

"okay, good data point."
okay - -
"okay, now let me get that footpad. that's a beautiful shot there. we're going to do footpad 3, i guess it is, or is that 17"
roger. thank you. readback not required. (columbia)
it's aria ts what it is.
"some large number. 06 23 35 37 ia{p-eva how's our time going, tony?"
"okay, now it's stowed."
roger.
"***, i had the meatball all the way. jack, are we going to have some nice boulders in this area."
...
"okay. i'm looking for where i put the first line heater on, so it was roughly about 14 minutes. we've been - we've been 20 minutes. yes.... okay ..."
"okay, we're coming off the ... c_ i just need that one visor down, don't i?"
yeah ....
okay. you got it.
"well, i won me a six-pack."
"okay, i need the purge valve."
"and we'll be leaving it on battery a all night long. okay, that's all the flight plan changes. i've got that flyby pad when you're ready."
"yes, that was all done, gordy. we just got side- tracked, and i didn't call you."
give you a big gold star for that.
"roger. i understand. eagle will power down the comm, and we are just approaching 27 volts now. it looks like we won't have to bother with the high taps."
ohhh! damn. these four are tough marks.
- - which one's yours?
"okay; guidance control, p to a."
"apollo 11, this is houston. we are noz receiving your fm downlink yet. we are standing by."
okay. you got the - you got some - three capture latches in there? all righty.
"here's november november; it may have three or four pictures left. it's on 160 .... me set one up. oh, we've got papa papa for opportunity, huh? yes. i'll get it. houston, are you ready for laser altimeter, on?"
okay.
okay.
"no. no. jack, did you get the pictures, good pictures? because i can take it. see that one - oh, yes - see that one on the mare?"
which crater did you guys go to? you landed right there. you're at the head crater.
could you give us that page number again. page 5 doesn't make sense.

"yeah, there's a lot of lm stuff in there."
very good. the things seems to be working okay.
"i don't want to give them a halfway chance. i don't think they deserve it, ken. you're just being overly nice to them. you want to look out the window and see if you can do it, or -"
"what did you say about the gulf, pete?"
"apollo 16, houston. we're clear to turn the data system off down on panel 230."
"john, it doesn't seem to be a hot mike now. evidently, you got it off."

"okay, dave, copied you back at the lm, parking the rover normally, and we're standing by for tv again."
and we'd like you to look at the bat temperature on the uv camera.
let's see how close we are. let's see....
"hey, tony, that rake soil - sample was in 332, and i just, by - with an experiment, pinched one of the rocks, and it all - it broke."
"well, joe, i didn't think we had any extra inflight garments aboard, but we're going to check right now."
okay. (tran_) 04 12 37 l9 _ ... (tr*nq) 04 12 37 _41 cdr okay. we can stow this. (tranq)
"apollo 17, houston. we'd like to talk to you guys before you go to bed, please."
"tony, one other comment from my side, distances are pretty deceiving here for me. i'm looking out over john's shoulder, and it looks like to me you could throw a rock into south ray from our present position; which is, i know, impossible. a second comment has to do with the orbital, since we got so muck [sic] so much look at the ground sailing around waiting to come down. everywhere that we could see - everywhere we saw the ground, which is just about the whole sunlit side. in the crater walls and on the ridges, you had to - we had the same lineation that the appllo 15 pho- tography showed on hadley delta and hadley mountains. it was really remarkable how in the crater walls primarily, and in the ridges, and it gave you the impression that it was a fracture pattern that was all trending parallel to the - concentric around the craters, in the craters and - on the ridge, though they were sort of either parallel to the ground or at some depth, be what that may. over."
all righty.
"let me get it, after that."
okay. i'm on the ladder. door is closed.
"okay, 16. on those numbers you've got on the dsky there, if you'll go to the g&n checklist, page 9-4, you can load register 2 and 3 in column bravo, lines 4 and 5."
"well, okay. is that everything in the flight plan?"
"okay, joe. azimuth is put in, and i'm working on elevation."
"houston, orion. over."
"okay. how about making those all five digit readouts; read them again, charlie."
okay. lr cubed is off.
all set.
"well, you just can't get a grip on it."
of course_ we're seeing country south of _slo_o _? that we've never seen before. roge

"okay, we're getting it; and i'm seeing evidence of it now."
"okay, stand by 1."
"okay, al, a little explanation. it's a photo pad i'm due to read you at 150 and 10. you can find the little block there, and it happens that the pass and all that will be taking place on the 151-hour frame. so it's at the 151:lo - 150 and l0 that you'll find the little squares for it. --"
"hello, apollo ll. houston. we've been noting some funnies on the 02 flow indicator _;ransducer. we've kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - we expected to see an 02 flow pegged h_gh with the waste stowage vent to vent. it was not. we also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent v_lve. w_'re going to con- tinue to take a look at this through the night, a_ldwe'll be with you in the morning wi th an assessment of the problem. also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to vent, does the detent - correction - does the arrow line up with the detent:' over. o0 il 07 18 cmp stand by one, charlie. we'll give you something on the detent."

go by that little dark crater over there. there's - a very blocky-rim small crater that's a dark-rim crater instead of a bright rim like we'd seen some around that looked fresh. it partly may be the angle at which we're approaching it.
close .... up ....
"yes, i know, but - 04 23 31 54 ia{p-i_m okay."

"it's stuck, joe, and i think where it's stuck is where the - third probe joins the second probe. and i - you know, you can never get those things apart, but we could stick - i got four other probes in here, if you want me to pull out the four i got and stick the other four in - in hopes that it gets down some distance. we could try that if you like."

"and, houston, one other comment. apparently some- time during launch, the rcs b secondary propellant isolation valve closed, and we recycled it and got a gray t-l_back."
"good readback, ken. 04 06 i0 24 c_ and this is to be a - a i-foot-per-second radial inward."

"yes, indeed. get some rest there and have at it tomorrow."
"what came open, charlie?"
okay. i've got to clean the old suit circuit return screen yet.

okay.
"tony, does the - i can't remember. does the gsvc - cvsc go into the - the rock box?"

"is it the lower 5? the lower, right?"
"okay, you have the computer."
"roger. 04 12 27 40 cdr-i_4 hey, joe. jim's just pointed out another black one now that must be 300 meters out. and it's so dark that it looks like a shadow. it's just coal black, and it looks like it might be about the same size."

"time number 53 you said that. 10 03 39 22 cml° well, i guess i'm next then. i - i thought of - i knew someone would ask that question, and i've been asking that question, too. and i don't think i can put an impression. there's so many that we've crammed in in the last 12 days. and it seems like each one comes on top of the other one, and the immediate response that you come up with is ""that's the most fantastic thing i've ever seen."" in - in a lot of respects, it really is. there - there have been so many events and so many sights that, in my case, i'm going to have to sit and think about this one for a long time before i could ever pick out one, and then i'm not sure i'll ever be able to say that there was a unique thing, or a most memorable event. the whole thing has been a - just one series of very impressive, and i hate to use the word, but i don't know anything else except to say, ""it's fantastic."""
"okay, that 's done."

here it is. stand by just 1.
"hey, jack. just a couple more comments on that dse. i think, as you well know, it's very critical on the position of your - of your boom there, and those areas that you're critical in, why, make sure that you've - you've really got those beauties up or you're talking right in - right into it. and this - this really makes a difference, because the dse - the volume is - is fairly low, and if you're muddled just the least bit, why, it - it's going to be difficult to pick it up. so talk slow, and - and get right up next to the mike, because i know you - you're doing it. just some voices come across a little better than others."

"you know, i wish we had more rocks."

"okay, update the ags, houston? ..."

"wait a minute and i'll get my flashlight, and then we can start doing it again systematically."
yes. beautiful. going to make it nice to see in.
"is it - well, i'll take the pictures. let's get one sample. jim's out of film, or his camera stopped, and i can take the pictures."
"now, wait a minute."
roger. we copy.

"yeah, we're at 33, and 5 should be at 33 and - okay, tony; we're on a flat area now at 355 at 3.3, and - and i think it's - it apparently is a bench. it - about - we're passing station 5, a little to the east."

not yet.
"okay. i'll - let me dig for them. gordo, on these boom deploy times and retract times, i don't have all of those times each time i do it, precisely, because sometimes it happens that i'm off busy doing something else, and i - you know, i miss the barber pole, so i - i don't have all of them."
"oh, i got to dust those radiators. i can't leave them like that. *** this is not a very good place to dust them, though. *** try one time. oh, boy."
try'_ng to.

my fuel is kind of low.
(sneeze)
i don't think it makes any difference. we just put it in here. you're right.
i'm cold; are you cold?
you tell me what time 30 minutes more is. and i'll tell you if that's right.
yaw. i'm going the wrong way though_ aren't i?

i was just getting this out for you. let me - i can get this side better.
"roger, dave and jim. and we've got them on the map."
"what's the she tank down to now, jack?"
"how you read me, dick? okay?"
and we're still getting good signals.
"i'd say the color of the - the local surface is (tranq) very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this sun angle, about l0 degrees sun angle, or that nature. it's pretty much without color. it's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero-phase line; smd it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to thc s_m. the - some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt. 04 07 lh 02 cc roger, tranquility. we see the noun 93, verb 34."

"they're down to the left of the lm, there."
roger. that sounds interesting.
probably pretty even.
"i got to get one more view from up here. john, i got to - i'll take the pan from right here."
okay. i'm going to enable jets charlie 3 and dog 3. disable bravo 3 and alfa 3.
"roger, gene. l_p-lm to say that there is a boulder, as such, actually sitting on the surface, i can't - i really can't find one, unless they're along - around something very small and possibly younger craters. but i think for the most part everything is somewhat mantled."
"come watch ev - oh, wait a minute. you got cabin repress in auto?"

"stand by on that, ron."
what else do you have to do here?
"that's one of the blue-gray rocks, bob. and it's - got a *** colored fragment that runs the full height of it, about a meter and a half thick. and then it's got the gray *** gray rock on the other side. as a matter of fact, - let me look at it closely. *** fragment in it all right."
roger. and over there at 167:55 where it's - the antenna retract bit?
it should be a lift-off. straight up. correction. straight out.
"go ahead, gordo. we'd like to hear it now. 02 i0 51 58 cc okay. first, a look at the weather in the local area. it's going to be mostly cloudy through sunday, with a chance of showers here today - but much warmer. i'll have to wait until we get through the omni switch here, and then i'll be back with you."

hey!
"go ahead, houston. say it again - go aheaa, america. c>_ (laughter) okay, we've got the cor_z_ander'smenu for yesterday."
"30,000."
"are you going to give us an update, joe?"
"dick gordon only tracked our side once, damn it. got us there."
you got it wrapped around ...
.. i see.
"okay, jim. we'd like to get a suggested time from you. we can figure out a free-return maneuver for any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a pad."
i didn't bring the rake.
go ahead.
"looks like we might have stuck the rear pad in a crater back there somewhere, huh?"
"hey, joe, how about a quick single core here."
"yes, long lath's about - centimeter. -"
"roger. and instead of two frames at 20 seconds, we would like one frame at 20 seconds; and we would like a second frame at 2 seconds."
now we've got a few very bright particles or frag- ments or something that go drifting by as we maneuver.
"okay. 04 14 02 28 i_mp i've already given them to you, forget it."
"okay, papa papa is out and loaded. i'll try to pick up descartes to andel with it."
mark it.
...
"it's really swinging, isn't it?"
i'm tracking him exactly. i don't want to waste gas.
roger.
"gordo, we're coming in right down on top of it. what's our perigee, did you say? 7b miles?"
go.
"i'm sorry. i was uv - on. uv cover, open."
... okay.
"say, jack. we noticed the 02 flow has dropped down now. we're wondering, did you all close the waste storage vent valve?"
"orion, houston."
"okay, bob. the surface is not changing. we see no craters that seem to penetrate into bedrock out in here - that is with blocky rims, and that's quite a contrast to the area we sampled at sta- tion la yesterday. i see - i cannot see in _¥ field of view any blocky-rim craters. there are slight craters with - with fragmental walls and rims, hut it looks like incident rock rather than the subfloor material."
17108 ob l0 bo lb lmp 17108.
"roger, jim; and that might very well be earthlight at i o'clock. and domingo crater should be on your left, now."
"i didn't watch it all the way until it went out of sight. i'll have to check here. 00 0b 57 32 cc yeah, i guess we saw even tower jett."
"darn it. you know, bob, one of the problems is i'm working in a small crater; and it's just a little difficult to work on these slopes. okay. it's on. i'm ready to put the drill in."
"oh, that's very good news, joe. thank you. we hadn't heard about the lr cubed, but we were hoping it was superclean."
"okay, bob, we're getting ready for the alfmed. i just took a red-filter and a blue-filter pictures, - on frame 41 now, with a 35-millimeter - pictures of the earth. and i took them one stop smaller - that is, more open - than the lightmeter said, hoping to compensate for the small earth. the earth just barely fills the most inner - the innermost circle of the spotmeter. also, there's a very strong band of clouds, shaped sort of like a narrow fir tree, with a base about 20 degrees of longitude west of baja california, that extends up, i believe, into the vicinity of hawaii. and the top terminates in a very strong northern cyclone pattern."
i will.
"okay. bat 1, hi volt, on."
"how am i doing on the instrument panel, charlie? 09 02 30 40 ij_p fine."
...
yes.
need some help?
zero?
"okay. having the same problem with that src today as i did yesterday, i have to pound on the hand2e - to get it sealed."
"okay, jack. that's correct. go to page 1-7. scs electronics power, off; scs signal conditioner/ driver bias 1 and 2, off; and ]_mag power, both, off; and dyrect 02 valve to clo_e. over."
can you give me the time bias so we can - i can do that? update the times on the page?
mine 's jets.

yeah.
okay.
roger; thank you.
all right; 5-d?
"- - and, at 194:23, we're going to close the hatches."
"roger. we understand. ail right, if - if you find a good dense one that you - you think has got a good hard surface on it, we'll go ahead and take it."

'yes.
okay. it is done.
"ah, no, we're saving that for tomorrow, joe. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
i'm in egress.

loud and clear. (eagle )
"okay, thank you. cmf okay, i'm ready to copy the tei. c_ got it all dirty. houston, america, i'm ready to copy the tei pad."
we're now passing ... through scorpio.
"bob, you're coming through with a large squeal right now in the background."
"that sounds good, alfredo. and if you like, i'm standing by down here with a pao gold bugle morning news, if you'd like to hear some."
"mhat's correct. cb cte, main a and i4ain b, closed. 05 06 52 05 ci{p cb cte, main a and ma];nb, closed."
"roger, dave. and when you hold it together, we can read you loud and clear. so that's the problem. i guess we need a tape job on that antenna."
okay; let me get it. that's all right. *** until you're ready. *** make it?
"what's the number, bob?"
i wonder if i took a picture of that block deal? (laughing) i hope i did. getting to be so automatic that i'm not sure what i'm taking any more.
"okay, ron. we're picking up some thermal prob2ems on the pan camera. would you manual_y roll left to 30 degrees and we'll hold it unti_ we've passed - you know the terminator - or cross the terminator."
"put it all - up here, yes. on the other side of the valve."
"yeah. okay, we shouldn't have closed that hatch all the way. we've got our water still on."
"yes, we'll get it."
"okay. houston, are you ready for the e-memory dump? over. tape38/3"
ok_.
okay. that sounds good.
"okay, now. stand by a minute, joe."
"okay, lm sep, two, open. o0 oh o0 44 lmp i got them. okay. the 02 tank isol valve is gray."

"15, we'd like to have 0mni bravo."
"dave, this is houston again. while we're talking, could you look back in your time line for us, please, and give us the results of your _s test. i guess that's a bias reading at around 27 hours."
you want to put that on there?
"okay, 16; if you'll go accept, we'll uplink this clock sync. and while they're doing that, i'll tell you kind of what's going to happen. but - we're going to do it. the total change will be 24 hours 34 minutes and 12 seconds. and what we wculd like you to do is on, let's see here, page 338 in the flight plan, we'd like you to pick up at about 226:30 in the flight plan - -"

"okay, think i left off, or was cut off there without mentioning two varieties of breccia in the south massif. they found blue-gray and tan-gray and, without going into the geological details, those are the two types they found up there at nansen. the subfloor unit was exposed as blocks and ejecta around larger craters had been partly buried by dark mantle. and craters apparently had penetrated thin parts of the light mantle. espe- cially good samples were obtained from the rim of camelot where the same textural characteristics which are banding caused by variations in vesicle concentration, coarse-grain size, and mineralogic features, as reported in eva-l, were found. so apparently this unit is quite uniform over the distances that they have covered so far in the traverses. the prominent east-facing scarp, crossing the valley floor from north to south about 5 kilometers west of the lm, was traversed twice near the crater lara, near hole-in-the-wall, al- although hole-in-the-wall appeared to be pretty subtle. no change in the surface characteristics or lithology of the mantle was discernible where the astronauts traversed the scarp. outcrops of i boulders were observed farther to the north where the northward extension of the scarp crosses the face of the north massif, it forms a notably smooth and relatively young-appearing surface. elsewhere, the surface of the north massif is prominently furrowed and textured, and the crew described it as a cross-hatched pattern on the surface that they could see with one set of linea- ments dipping eastward and the other westward at about 30 degrees. some of the most interesting observations made during the eva were related to craters. many small craters within the dark mantle have glass-coated central pits. jack called them dimples. some of the pits are nearly cylindrical and mayb e half again as deep as the crater itself. other small craters occurring in both the dark and light mantle have bright halos, but these halos appear to be noticeably brighter on the light- colored material. this bright material is not blocky or fragmental ejecta derived from a subfloor layer, but rather appears to consist of ""instant rock"" or soil breccia which has been partly con- solidatedby the impact shock itself. the most interesting eureka during the eva was at station 4, shorty crater, where jack found some bright red or orange, he described it, orange dirt within the gray to dark-gray rim material. the colored band- lng is circumferential to the crater and resembled alteration halos, which occur around many terres- trial volcanic vents. so you can see why the geologists are excited on that one. the morphology of shorty, however, is similar in some respects - -"

"readback's correct, al. thank you."
yes.
"houston, this is 15."
"that's affirmative, al. 04 22 36 43 _p okay."
"just looking at the southern edge of grimaldi, bob, and we probably have it covered on photos, but there's a nice tangential to slightly cir- cumferential graben along the southern wall and climbs out over the western rim and off the eastern rim, and that graben is premare - premare."
"roger; understand. you wanted the discriminator left in low, and you wanted us to pause in the off on the ion source on your cue."
"13, we're ready on the tv when you are. any time."
that's affirmative. around 164.

okay. here we go. head up to the crater. think we can get there without any trouble?
okay.
"well, i'm not."
okay. that didn't do it.
"there you are, our mysterious and unknown descartes. highland plains, apollo 16 is gonna change your image. i'm glad they got old brer rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs. okay, /- recorder's off. vox s-band to max, utility floods are off. side panels are off. here i come, babe."
give the engine arm.
"dick wants to know where falcon crater is, if you can see it?"
"roger. are you reading me, buzz? over."
"master arm, on. i got two good lights. i24p okay."
"apollo 13, houston."
"roger. guys, before you go to sleep, i'd like to have the mode - s-band normal mode - switch voice to off, please."
"apollo 11, houston. are you up and at them yet? qver."
"okay, we got a good burn. minus 2.7. 03 0_ 58 23 cdr okay. gimbal motors, off."

okay.
"aquarius, houston."
"say, houston, by the way, the lcg you'll get back is the one i wore on the third eva only."
"roger. and - i would - we're going to delete, on those procedures there, the mapping camera, retract; and the mapping camera/laser altimeter cover, _ ·close. _-we're going to leave those out all _ight, and we'll have a - a plan tomorrow on how we're ·going to handle the mapping camera."
okay.
it's shiny. 199.
"roger. i've got your consumables update, if you're ready to copy."
loud and clear; how me?
"okay, you've got 4 milliradians to the north. you're at 1500 feet now."
"h_? no, weird is - weird is almost due east of the lm. that's - oh, there it is. look, see - -"
some of them - that looks like a breccia right there in front of us.
and why don't you give us a call when you're ready to take these flight plan updates?
*** check it to make sure you're okay.
"hey, ron. if you let it grow a little bit, you c_n join the backup crew. 07 15 14 19 cm? hey, that's right. well, there g3es old picard right through the telescope. at this kind of sun angle, he still has the dark halo. it looks like the dark halo is a little bit smaller. you can't notice the distinction quite as mach. it only goes out to about half a crater d_ameter now. you can see ahead of something out to one crater diam- eter. you can still see the dark material, dark albedo-type stuff on the eastern side of the crater. _nd the demarcation between the two of them. i% just disappeared."
"okay_ okay; i'm keeping track of you guys here an vhe lunar sounder offtimes. it'll be just slightly less than 198:30, and i'll give you some hacks on that as we get down ye it. and we're reaay ye go to h2 t_nks 1 and 2 to off, and t_rk 3 ye auto. 08 c3 42 03 t_mp okay, bob, that's got it. 1 and 2_ off, and 3, auto."

and i think the reason you don't read voltage is it's a circuit breaker that we have called as being out.
"get - can you get that on that side, jack?"
"no, it's - no, i'm going to 1 right now."
okay. and did you get the batteries - -

"okay; we'll see how we do. oops! hang on, buddy."

so we're going to have to do some of that stuff now.
"we can take it later, jim. that's good."
"yes, ... you read my mind. i do want to get one of these light-colored rocks, though."
freak you.

okay. i'll meet you out there.
anyone's fine.

that does. yes. that goes under the seat.
all right. 04 14 50 41' cmp and the vhf is off to receive only - is off.
"yes, just like the map shows, and all the pictures, you've got a definite demarcation in the annulus around serenitatis here, as you look by sulpicius gallus area. as you look at it - i'm going to have to take another check on it - but the dark annulus looks to me like it's raised above the mare, proper, itself. i'll check that a little more as we come on across."
"houston, 15."
mark that.
okay. i need to set ordeal.
i'll point your - point the tv right at dave. how's that?
roger. we were driving more at force penetration. and did you meet any rocks or anything like thav?
"oh, yes. okay; go ahead."
roger. read you through the lm. you guys both read me through the lm?
"why don't you take the map, and i'll just head down to the general area of the lm, and you'll probably get enough elevation view from down there so we can see weird."
"yes, delta-v a and b switches, off."
it's released. it's in the yellow?
"okay. can you give us, maybe, a slight maneuver?"
"okay, vance. you're saying we should start into the prep in the contingency book at about 104:30, and i'll talk this over in a minute with jim and we'll get back with you on it. when in the burn i':w,/_ '_](, attitude, we should see the sun right at the top of the aot, and i assume this is detent number 2. jim and i'd already been talking about that, and just eyeballing the terminator in the earth, we figured the sun at about something like a 70-degree angle - 65-degree angle, so that'll be right up there. we get one burn rule that says if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per second, shut her down. and, after we trim, you want me to leave 470 up for a while so you a2l can have a look at it, and you'll tell me when to get rid of it."
"i remember a guy who once said ""dirt dirt"" and it is [sic] ever! pshew!"
"yeah. 03 23 37 39 i2_p that comm can really screw you up. well, we're not gonna have tv from the i_m,unless we get that high gain up."

"okay. good deal. and whenever you get cleaned up, we got the entry pad and the landing area summary for you."
"okay, that last part was, cross out the ""125"" and put in ""1/8."" is that right?"
"just of interest to you, ron. we are really pleased with the way that our visual display and that worked out last night during the orbital science visual. farouk was able to feed me the questions, and i was able to get them to you. if you have any comments one way or another, if you don't want us to do it on rev 40 or not, let us know. we plan right now on rev 40 for those orbital science visuals to do the same thing going - it's the visuals through landing site down through d-caldera, and we're going to run the same operation, since it went so smoothly down here. we hope it went that way for you up there."

go ahead.
do a verb 96.
what?
roger. we're reading you loud and clear.
"the trouble is, there's a lot of other ... - yes, i think you're going to find it. don't - don_t de that. you're liable to get amongst them, again. that worries me a little bit."
"no, sir. i'm here."
"good evening. i'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, apollo 11. as we've been dis- cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. nell's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon, ""this is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind,"" i believe sum_ up these feelings very nicely. we accepted the challenge of going to the moon; the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e. the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission, i be._ieve, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance. today, i feel we're f_lly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace. in retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously (goss net 1) _ape 112/4 chose for our spacecraft, columbia and eagle. we've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the u.s. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the earth, from the planet earth to the moon; that symbol being the olive branch. it was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the moon. personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from psalms comes to mind to me. ""when i consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained_ what is man that thou art mindful of him."""
"no editorials, please (laughter)."
"falcon, houston. we have no probe temp, which indicates the umbilical is probably not well connected."

okay. that's reading to - - day 12
how many do you want?
"how does it look, charlie?"
"roger, karl. i'm enjoying it."
"dave, are you working on the last stem there?"
"hey, pete. we're getting close."
i'm at the dump valve. 3-i6 day 5
okay.
"roger. stand by. 0i 11 43 28 cc 11, houston. what's your exact que;tion? over. 01 11 43 34 cml° i've followed the procedure through step 7 down to the point where ijve got 27303 _nter, and this resulted in an operator error light. ii ii 1134_ cc ro_er. stand by."
"okay, prime water's, closed."
twenty seconds to go.
i thought you might be able to break it up. _
"okay. we copy that. --. lmp-l_ how about a jett bag, too?"
okay; stand by.
roger. we're almost there. hgme sweet home.
"hey, karl, we just ran a little check with our slide rule here, and it was something like 3000 drips per minute."
and we'll use the - the same procedure we've been using on thav.
okay; let me tighten this thing down - -
there you go. ***
"roger, al."
"yes, that's skilled craftsmanship. ***"
okay.
"roger, al; we copy."
got to get back on this time line in a minute.
what kind of pressures you have now?
'whatsector are you looking at?
"right. and, for your information, the tank went at 1937."
"... feel that baby this time. okay, going to cmc."
"they look great (laughter). age co'"".'""':3,.e,-. 08 23 57 05 c>? we got three beauties. 08 23 57 06 i2'd.'2 they look great! 08 23 57 07 c_,_p they're dereefed. 08 23 57 09 _ dereefed _d - oh, boy! that's mar_¢e!c:us. 08 23 57 12 _._p okay, we gev three good ones. _?_at do y_u _hink of'that ? 08 23 57 13 cdr/cmp/ three. 08 23 57 14 (_ aah, look at that - beautiful! okay, stay _n _he checklist. we're passing 8. 08 23 57 17 ]_[p try to get rid of this camera."
"okay. sitting tight; waiting for you, babe."
"go ahead, 15."
"stand by. 07 05 30 i_ cc casper's trying to call you now. and the con- figuration is on 7-12, on your checklist."
"okay, challenger; america. you're in att hold. you didn't get very far off that time, either. that's good. okay. tape7_/14"
okay. sep: get 100:13:56.00 - the pitch angle -- of 108.
"why don't you stay right there, and i'll come in and wipe it?"
"get you a soil - they want a soil bag full. hate to waste a bag on that one, but - -"
"bend over good, here. okay. whew. that bag is all folded up so much, i can't get to it. now you can get my antenna."
you can use that rover for everything.
i got it.
"we have the csm hatch out, the drogue and probe removed and stowed, and we're just abeut ready to open the lm hatch now."
"hey, falcon; endeavour. how do you read?"
"copy, 1.0, jim."
"go ahead, 15."
"okay, gordo. we're standing by in p40."
no problem on time.
"sorry, sorry."
"houston_ do you read _werica? _ that's affirmative, _erica_ and we have a piczure. over."
"roger, dave. copy that. why don't we save the double aekerman for the rougher terrain later on."
"hey, ken, are you - are you about there now?"
"jolhn says that when they did the first charges they ha_ to take it and vent it, but the charges i did i never saw it above !.5."
"okay. helium valves are auto; n2 a and b are good at 2500. okay, ... are minus 2 - you get delta-v thrust b to normal."
okay.
"let me put this up here. *** out of the way, because that's half the battle."
"it's not a calibrated detent, but i don't think you need it here."
"hey, gordy, i don't know whether your camera people have anything to do this evening, but i've got a little problem for them if they'd like to work on it."
"and we have not maneuvered, is that right? 03 15 16 23 cml° we have."
"okay. i'm sorry, 1 - yes, 78 hours. it only seems like it's been that long."
"17, houston. i_4p-i_ go ahead, joe."
"and, like you might expect, the top of the bottom core is dark, too."
"fred, we have enough data; recommend that jack take off the tm and power back down again, using his backout procedure. just let us know when he does it."
okay. that's what we got.
"okay, i'm ... mine."
"we got to go around this, charlie. 05 03 02 16 ia{p-eva yeah, you're 5 kilometers an hour, and the amps are oscillating about between 10 and 20."
"okay, 04:30. 282 is great; 41k is great, 73 is good; ags and pgns are right together."
go ahead.
"hey, jim, we had to turn on our window heaters for about 10 minutes per side to clear up the windows right aft - right before undocking."
"or, if necessary, to use the lm consmnab]es."
sure we do.
i'm reading you now. the last thing we got from you was the rcs quantities. we didn't get the bat quantities.
okay. _-_
roger.
"okay, we're starting on our big bag."
i know it.
okay. copy. you can see towards the west a light-albedo fresh crater. as you look back towards - okay. sounds good. we copy that. thank you.
okay. was that hag 350? we didn't get a number.
"in fact, turn two pages to 163:31."
"okay, we're cmc, auto. ail right. we've got 0.6. it's all right. okay, whoopee-dee-doo ! 00 0_ 45 28 cmp safe the pyr0s. okay, logic's off."
"here comes main a, number 1."
"do you copy those angles, houston - torquing angles ?"
"1 - 106, 3.2."
"needless to say, we're both very impressed."
"oh, i didn't - -"
"okay, my pan - out of the way real quick. 06 04 02 56 i_mp-eva joe, do you only - only want it 12 inches deep?"
"oh, yes. i didn't see that."
"okay_ here, let me - let me get this on you first since i got - -"
"okay, sounds good. thank you."
"hey, there's some bedrock on the bottom, i think, · here. looks like big boulders."
number 2 to ac.
okay.
"yes, i - my watch is set on houston time. what time will it be?"
"oh, i see. okay, we'll close it after a bit here."
"okay. the instructions were to tap the box gently, a]low the unit to remain motionless for an addi- tional 3 to 5 minutes, and then proceed."
"and, 17, we'd like the sep blankets opened and dusted one more time."
huh?
"orion, this is houston. we want you to get the rendezvous radar and the tracking light off as soon as it's feasible to conserve power."
"roger. i just drove in, and it's kind of a sleety rain. it feels like it might snow at any moment, although it's really not that cold. the ceiling is probably down about 6 - 700 feet. it is really rotten out there."
yes.
"roger. the delta-v test was good, and the null bias was 1.0."
okay. but i'm going to have to maneuver to the moon to help him out.
say again?
"okay. you're down in the mud again, jack. lots of background static."
i'll catch it.
go ahead. r-1 any report on computer read-outs. over?
"... if i thought you could ... things looking so ... o0 01 27 42 cml° what you got going for you there, leader?"
now you can stop and do the hydrogen purge.
"jack, when you are comfortably ready to punch off, you can go ahead and do it,"
sounds good.
okay.
a little bit.
"well, hold it like this; this is the way we're going; that's your side - -"
"let :me show you what to do with that one, charlie."
"intrepid, houston. we're watching."
okay. go ahead.
got it in!
"oh, okay. ' : ai_"
"okay, understand. just before ems mode, normal, on msfn cue, cb sps pilot valve, closed. a desired 1-second burn, which means that if we get a light, we open the circuit breaker after 1 second. if we have no light, you want to leave the circuit breaker closed for 3 seconds, and then open it."
"pete, will that direction of your travel be to the northeast direction?"
roger.
"i think you're probably doing the right thing, but beware."
but when you leave me at - okay.
...
roger.
okay. 35995.
okay. don leva - that's done - verify alignment. don the comfort gloves.
"i'm ready for it. you can hand me mine right now. 00 00 42 42 cm_ well, i've got to go down and get it first."
over here.
"okay, houston; we got a good transfer."
"i can't - i can, now that i've cleaned out some of that junk. 00'02 09 18 cmp ... back to a96."
thanks for the confidence.
"wait, wait, wait - okay."
"vhf a, ken?"
"apollo 11, apollo 11, this is houston. over."
"and eecomm says that as soon as you stir your cryos, request you go back to auto on that one tank."
okay; switch to a half.
here we go. 290 and 0. okay. t-start is in there.
... 05 06 ob 14 cdr-lm ain't locking. why don't we - wait until we get it pressurized. it's closed good and tight.
verify.
altitude go to zero. power signal on. cross pointer's centered. i'm not going to be able to see that power light. i've used that to tell me when the radar dropped in and out. okay. read that again.
"yes, 180. okay."
yes. plus ... right ....
okay.
huh?
"we're starting to move it now. okay. well, we're going to leave the rover here and that's what i wondered - why i wondered."
"well, there goes the shovel, but we can get that in a minute. 05 13 34 56 imp okay. that's good."
"houston, 15. go ahead."
"and then, if we go over to 151 hours. at 151 hours and l0 minutes, we would like to change the pan camera operation there, and we would like to say ""stereo, exposure, normal."" and at 151:15, we would like to delete the ""pan camera exposure, normal."""
"hey, tony. magazine alfa is going out with ll0."
"okay, got that, ken."
"- - we cam ... decide priorities between this station or any other station. it's the fact that we're running up against the walkback constraints here in just a very few minutes, about 20 minutes."
can i get a towel?
"and, orion, the docs tell me you were running about an 88 average heartbeat today. 06 07 24 45 lmid-lm okay. okay, thank you. is that both of us?"
ail right. i'll try.
we got an antenna switch coming.
roger. understand.
roger. the magazine we'll be using for entry tomorrow is magazine m. over.
give me - just give me that camera one time.
"roger, al."
that right?
"stand by, intrepid. we'll be right with you."
"and we hope you're going to get lots of rest here tonight. you've got plenty of time to do it, and, of course, with only two meals a day, why, you ought to be hungry enough to push the heck out of that. but as long as you're feeling good, why, everybody will be real happy down here, and you go as far as you feel like going. 05 08 58 4_ cdr-lm that's what we're doing. 05 08 58 h6 mcc roger."
they were just wondering if your looking out that way_ if you could give them some sort of update of what the weather in the wake island - kwajalein - the south of the wake area looks like.
i tho_gbt the idea was we took turns.
thank you.
"ken, houston."
roger.
"okay, stand by. lots of people thinking down here now."
that's a satellite.
"i'm - i will for docking, i'm not - -"
"okay, ron, we've got a - a flight plan update and a lunar sounder pad, if you want to take it before we get into the visuals here."
right on.
that's going to be good.
"okay, challenger. we're seeing it at the water separator."
yes. time skip 10 10 10 38 cml° you got it?
"okay, and finally, four li0h cans, the ones used in the lm, and those can go in the jettison bag in the lm. okay, a couple of notes. after load- ing the isa, recommend secure it to the right- hand restraint system."
- - ... with that.
connect the vacuum line.
"jim, we're having trouble verifying your water off."
"okay, you want me to step - down from here? 05 12 19 32 12_ no, i'll - i'll get the cross-sun."
"okay, gene. can you look at the capture latches? i've got it preloaded here now."
okay. we're ready to proceed with hatch closeup.
"okay, houston. the dap looks good."
got it.
- - difference between a rock being identifiable mad not being identifiable is the level of training. that just says you guys were well trained.
"yes. i wonder why? hey, houston."
trouble? maybe i'll struggle too.
"we were receiving data, but we did not read you on board. what is your present configuration? 04 16 38 h8 lm2° well, i've come off of the plss comm and back on to the ship's comm. a1 is still set up with his plss operating, and - -"
"att/translation, 4 jets."
"roger. page f2-20, column alfa: 05, 01042; 07, 00256; 11, i'll say again. ii, 00070; 12, 00042; 13, 77730. column bravo: 03, 00000_ 04_ 20017; 05, 20616. over."
copy.
"apollo 13, houston. are you back with us?"
"and i am watching takn pressures - are venting, the tanks are venting."
we want you to dust and get in. we got 14 minutes remaining before we need the hatch closed.
did that - did that recycling do any good?
"you look good to us, jack."
okay.
"apollo 11, ttouston. we hate to s:_y it, but w_ 'ti like to terminate this ptc and start ow_r a_?_iu. we have no assurance that we're goimz to get it through the sleep period with this fmmy config- uration, or funny pattern. we'd like you to stop it now and go back to pitch 090, yaw 0, and roll - whatever you stop on. over."
nice to have the quick response you guys have down there.
"we just looked at the boresight star. that's a good one. we're not going to mess with the sextant check, and we're in process of dumping."
"okay. let's see, al. do you have the -"
"okay .... good ..., pete ...."
"okay, john, are you ready for me to go to my attitude?"
"yes. c_ (laughter) okay. yes, i read you loud and clear, jack. yes. yes, we're going to have to move this tv a little bit, because i can't get the hatch open."
"11, this is houston. say again, please. (goss net 1) tape 18/10"
just now. i just got you back.
do you want your tv lens dusted off?
...
...
"okay; i'm on the porch, bob."
"was that for antares? 02 08 24 22 lm[_ okay. we'll get it going around the corne__. 0k 08 45 00 l_? hey, houston, clarify - 04 08 45 39 c_ kitty hawk, antares. 04 08 45 l1 l__) you're loud and clear. 04 08 45 43 c_? okay ... 04 08 45 47 _ okay. and you have it. 04 09 07 31 c__ okay, antares. how do you read on vox?"
yes.
"subfloor, isn't it? yes."
"orion, this is houston. on that rendezvous radar position, we saw a plus 33 instead of 33300. over."
"okay. i don't think this lightweight headset is quite as good as the - the other one, and i'm going to change as soon as i get a chance here."
excuse me.
"okay, we got this, we got that, we got this ... you're cutting out now ... disconnect plss h20 from pga; connect lm - -"
casper houston. how do you read?
mark.
"15, houston. when somebody gets a free hand up there, could we start the charge on battery a? we're afraid that might keep us from going to bed if we don't get it started soon. _""_ tape 175/1 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"dave and jim, what was the bearing - -"
"well, the impression of the back side is something i tried to collect from the time we got there until the time we left. and i'm still mulling that over in my mind. i've got a lot of transcripts we're going to have to read before i can psych it all out. but, in general, the impression i have is that the material on the back side, when you look at it on as small a detail as i could look, looks to me like it's very much like the material we find on the front side surrounding most of the big craters. the thing that looks different is that the back side is devoid of these large basins. we don't have the large mares; there's very little mare. zn fact, on the back side the only mare we saw was really post-tei, when we could look back and see a big area. but our groundtrack didn't pass over any mare in the daylight, so it took a while to psych that out. but z think that was a major difference was the absence of these large basins. and, on the back side, did we see sur- prises? well, we went up looking for - with a suspicion that we might findmaterial similiar to the descartes formation located in several areas on the back side, and, indeed, i think we did. i think we saw an awful lot. i think we saw a lot that looks exactly like the cayley. i think the things that i saw that were - probably the most surprising thing was the - on the side of a crater called guyot, which is just to the north and a little west of king crater - which is right about the eastern limb of the moon when you look at it from the earth - we saw a big hole, i'll call it a crater, in the side of this - of the wall of this crater, and it appeared that there was material oozing out. and on our last couple of revs, we passed almost directly overhead, and it looked like it was filled with a pool of material, and then this material had run down the side. and that's a formation typical of things you see like in hawaii, something i have not seen anywhere else on the moon, nor have i seen a picture of it."
"houston, 15."
"tranquility, this is houston. did you copy my mark at ll4 317"
"yes. that's right. as a matter of fact, doing this alinement on the earth this time will be like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield."
"okay. understand. i wonder if you could describe that - those vesicles in that rock at station 13. 09 21 30 15 imp well, they looked like - i call them drill holes. let's see if john has a different word for it."
"well, we missed some spectacular terminator photos. damn. you know, i was wondering. you want to get the terminator photos if still possible. that would have really been spectacular."
"launch vehicle indicator, gpi - s-ii/s-ivb, verify."
no.
"columbia, houston. how do you read?"
"bob, do you read us?"
"orion, this is houston. we'd like you to configure for rcs bravo only. over."
okay.
okay. it still doesn't seem like it does much. okay; i show a lineoof-sight rate that's essentially killed.
lower ev visor. okay. 04 23 49 21 _ yes.
that's right. there are a lot of those with a flat floor. got to be a lava-type thing down there.
no. 5-155
yes.
okay. let's see. okay. the charge is off to the - right.
freak you!
okay.
and we got a picture.
go ahead.
"don't forget, jack; you'll have to stow my antenna yet."
we don't have a picture yet.
go ahead_ bob.
let me know when you've copied the p22.
yes. it seemed to go a lot faster down there in the clean room at the cape.
open the bal load cross tie breaker on panel 16. over.
i'll get the legs as best i can. tape 112a/_3
okay.
yes.
"man, would you believe i'm hungry again? would you stick that back in the - here?"
"okay; urine line heater's going to come off, and the breaker is out. okay."
three minutes? you want to put 3 minutes - i'll put 2-1/2 on there.
son of a bitch - -
you had some bad coremthere. i understand you want us to go to block 6.
and the rim of korolev is readily visible standing out by itself in the - in the darker or the unlit part of the - of the moon. i can see the central peaks or mountains very well lit up.
roger. we've copied them.
"okay, we've got a large boulder of very intensely fractured rock, right on the rim, right near the rover. it looks like - it looks like a finely vesicular version of our clinopyroxene gabbro. it's obviously crystalline and has generally that same appearance. there is, in one spot here, some inclusions of a darker gray rock also intensely fractured. the fracture systems, i think, will show up well in the flight line stereo."
"okay, joe. i'm ready to copy the midcourse 4 pad."
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. we'd like to hold off on ptc a little bit longer until we get this mapping camera business straightened out. and, jim, for some troubleshooting on this, we'd like to have you check on panel 181 the main a circuit breaker, closed, and the deploy/retract switch in the retract position. and on panel 278, the deploy main a circuit breaker, closed. over."
left.
"just a second, ..."
i got it going - just fine.
you're in accept p20.
"pga is located in the l-shaped bag with the other two pga's. the lm shield was jettisoned with the - correction, the cmp's helmet shield was jettisoned with the i34,and his he]met and gloves, instead of being in the sleep restraint, are in the hatch bags."
okay. 07 22 09 24 cml° okay; put it to - -
okay. give me a countdown at 6 minutes.
"well, that was good thinking because we about had a small flood up here."
just put it down there and let's keep it going.
what's that?
"aquarius, we see your glycol temperature gettin£_ up there. if you want to make it a little warmer, or you can try putting your suit temp valve to high, ii'you haven't already got it there."
yeah. l0 00 20 32 cml° and you just learn to live with that. the only place i see a hazard is in recovery. if you had to really exert yourself - -
"okay, bob. i've kind of fiddled around with the sensors, now. are they working okay now?"
"i know. 05 12 42 b8 cdr okay, you want to - you want to catch that - -"
they are. they're very light colored; they look like the shattered anorthosites. they have white halos - i _hink that's what those fragments are.
like it.
"yes. it's this soft, white inclusion again. it breaks pretty easy."
"i think now i see the utility light still in the stowage bag. hey, that's a great shot right there. we see you in there. guess that's nell and mike. better be, anyway."
or 1007
"okay, we were just searching around here a little bit - far-out possibility might be that we had a small leak in there or something and it was causing the peeled paint to flow off in a particular direc- tion; and we were just wondering if you had any indication that that might be the case, or whether it's just flying off at right angles? tape19/4 01 oh 31 54 lmp well, when we first saw it, that was our opinion also, but now that most of it's gooe - is - it - it's sort of just coming off in different direc- tions. o_rer."
okay.
"hey, henry, how do you read casper now?"
on the i_m.
"pete, where's the saddlebag? you don't have one."
"okay. well, i had a feeling what i was seeing yesterday might have just been the remnants of teresa [sic], which i think went - got into that area a couple days ago. it was not a very well- developed system, but did seem - seem to be iso- lated from the other cloudiness that i would have put into the tropical convergence zone. that was between wake and kwajalein."

"02 - 02 seems a little higher h2, relatively speaking. cml° okay. that's pretty close. verified: secs arm breakers are closed."
"oh, rats. yeah."
you did get suit fan number 2?
"hey, jack, ..."
"roger, jim. we've got a beautiful picture. we're trying to look into the sun at the moment, somewhat unsuccessfully. but the tv is working beautifully."
saw to it that my umbilical was limited in its length.
want to take them off?
"that's correct. we - and, they say that they would like to have you do the configuring of the dse that comes up there at 141:35. and if you can listen for another minute, i've got au eecom status if you'd like."
"down to almost 1.5 now, psi. okay; my relief valve just seated at 5.3."
"that's mag november november. oh, wait a minute. that's gene's crater, isn't it?"

"wonder if i can get that dac on this thing. 08 08 b4 38 cmp yeah, why don't you get the status report; i'll try to get the dac going."
those are the two i think they wanted us to be at_ and i think that's a good choice if we can get up there.

"i can only add that we're bringing back just a lot of - lot of data and a lot of material, and it's going to take many years for people to really appreciate how much was gained from - from this flight."
"and houston, jack is showing fred the procedures before we start up."
"yeah, i could correctly identify this rock as out of north ray. no, i can't. it sure looks like that rock that we saw."

"okay, bag 355."
okay.
"dave, i guess the main reason is, before you do it, we'd like to get some recorders configured. we're setting the recorders up now so we can monitor the - the problem as you go through it, and then there is no reason you can't try pushing on the panel, provided the pilot valve breakers and the group 5 breakers are pulled."
what's that?
roger.
"yes, they are. most of them have been buried at this time, and those seem like they're right on the - - 05 02 32 43 iawp-eva yes, they're right on the surface for some reason."

"it is? i can't see a thing, looking into the sun. pull."
"okay, pete. super double fantastic burn. if you're ready, i'll give you a burn status report."
"okay, don. i was just going to let it - see how it does - i just moved it to about the middle amount i could. and the ops is now reading 800 psi."
"yeah. that's right, ken. we're going down with you. we'd have to thrust up, according to the needle."
that means we're leaving tomorrow.
"13, houston."
"wow, that was a good choice. i do, too. hey, can't we get up there closer - in that - right in that block, john? we won't have so far to walk. upslope. seems to be a flat place about right up here. tape 9_/32"

"sure that's the bottom, huh?"
"yes, you do."
okay (laughter).
okay. it's in auto.
mark; 03:30.
"the second part of that question was: did you see any differences between cayley and descartes? 10 03 32 54 _ yes, i think there's a - distinctly different morph- ology.involved in these two units. our preflight training is a little different in impression than what i think i saw; and, again, we have, like i say, a 10-power resolution. i think the - the real answer of what this material is, is going to lay in analyzing the data postflight. we have some good film records, and i think the - when you put that together with the rocks we picked up, we'll have a pretty powerful story that'll explain a lot of things we don't know now. but i think that there are sec- tions of material we called descartes, particularly the material that makes up stone and smoky, and that stuff runs all the way south down to the old descartes crater for which the region is named. and that does look texturally entirely different from the cayley formation."
"yeah, i believe so."
"okay. roger that, jim. i want to verify a couple of things i'm not sure i heard you read back. the first one was zebra libra (laughter) that's sigma libra. the set stars 31 and 23. did you get that? over."
"okay, you were a little broken up there, jim, but i think it's getting better. we are ready for the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever you are."
"and, houston; 15. i have some command module rcs injector temperatures for you."
"oh, shoot! bob, i gave you one at the rock. it's now 68."
"80 feet - 80 feet, coming down at 4; you're look- ing good. 70 feet. looking real good. 63 feet, 60, coming down at 3. 50 feet, coming down. watch for the dust."
"okay. understand. m_ only question, joe, is the fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did not go to null when i did an auto maneuver. i'd tried to go manually to the attitude; s_ldthen went to auto, but the roll and the yaw do not come in at all. 05 ]7 11 14 cc roger. i haven't got an answer on that yet, but your attitude looks ve_7 close."
"man, you hit my foot; it really - -"
"you're loud and clear down there, jim,"
we are getting there slowly.
see it right there.
yes.
"say again, hank."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"disturbs you too, doesn't it?"
that's affirmative. we just had low bit rate during the burn.
"okay, the flight plan updates that you gave to jim a little while - earlier included mass spec experiment, on and some switching with the dis- criminator and multiplier. now, as of yesterday, we had decided not to use the mass spec because of boom deploy problems. has somebody decided that we now should deploy the boom?"
"roger. can't win them all, john. that was a beautiful job; you guys were right on the line all the way. for your information, we do have some people playing around with a potential fix for that heat flow thing, but my personal opinion is that it ain't going to work. i don't think it's worth the bother, but we'll talk to you about that later, if it looks llke it's at all possible. 05 l0 42 51 cdr-im roger. --separate, simultaneous communications link in use betw_n cc and cm 05 09 25 xx begin lunar rev 29"

yes. that's why they're on there.
"houston, 15. did you get the gyro torquing angles?"
can you afford that?
"okay. well, i guess there were a great many new thrills for me, and the one that was most im- pressive though was the lift-off. it began the flight, and i knew that i w_s going into space after a few years of waiting and training. and then, as far as the event that i would not like to - to repeat again, was probably the time when i fell down in front of the tv when we were deploying the rover."
"okay. i got to take a set of pictures after that, by the way. show where they are."

"bob, i'm looking over gene's shoulder here at the earth, and it must be an awful clear day for the so-called convergence zone across africa. gene, i think, indicated, as it looked to us as we crossed it earlier, most of africa is clear. only some - probably are broken and scattered clouds - cumulus in the east central portion that are run- ning along the line of - north/south lines."
roger. got it.
think that'll go under it?
x-ray to standby.
"yes, i sure did; it came out of there straight."
roger. after the p52.
roger. there are the torquing angles. are you picking them up?
"okay, i'll get it. why don't we just put one of them in there, john? well, they ain't gonna get any cleaner. i mean - we got to live with this stuff."
"*** you, gordy."
"houston, 15. go."
"okay. i don't want to do any unnecessary brushing. how about somebody reading the eva closeout decal to me. this thing is so dusty, i can't read any- thing. amp-hours - well, bearing is 243, which can't be right; distance 11.4_ range 210. amp-hours is 28, and 120 on 2; and amps, of course, are off- scale low. batter - volts are 65, 65. forward and rear motor temps are off-scale low. and, of course, the - battery 1 is off-scale low, and battery 2 is reading 1 - 43."

okay.
"good navy man. t_mp-lm be a good place to fill with water, you'd make a nice rec site out of this valley. you could put some cabins up on the side of the massif. nice flat bottom, no trees. both mags up. the fishing ought to be pretty good if you stocked it."
"houston, the descent batts are coming off."
"just trip it. you might want to trip iz - trim it off that thing, pete."
"okay. get the camera, and i'll give them a grav- imeter reading. is that all you need? because i'll go get the flag."
"before you get out, let me get that - your antenna."

okay. roger. let's see. we don't want the drill on here. what do you want to do with the drill?
"oh, thank you, geno. it looks much better."
"yes. yes. i tell you, i'd be a little bit nervous about the, the way that baby put us in orbit ! 00 01 28 27 cs_p yes. how's our tanks going? i guess we ough_ to take a look at those over here."
*** there are some holes and rocks around here. who told me this was a flat landing site?
it's right over here.
"gordy, you want the 02 heaters 1 and 2 to auto now?"
"locked, lock locked."
... on?
"and, ken, i've got a few questions about the flow of mandel'shtam when you've a chance you want to talk about it."
"okay, gene. can you look at the capture latches? i've got it preloaded here, now."
roger.
huh?
"joe, i can't seem to get the chuck to reset. it won't - go counterclockwise out of its seat."
okay. you want a pro on that?
"bob, i have to reiterate. even the small - even the very small - the l- and 2-inch - 3-inch frag- ments that are laying around here have been dusted and filleted - -"
oh-oh. i didn't know you were going to eat that. i'm sorry. 08 23 06 2_ imp it's already reconstituted.
i don't think you can ...
"roger. imp xouston, i'm going to - i'm waiting your cue to check out the number 2 pressure indicator."
"yes, i guess in a couple cratersjwe remarked that we saw a boulder distribution that looked like it was linear, like it was a ray pattern."
we'll get it later. no hurry.
get the rocks over here. come on. we can't baloney all day. we've got to get out of here. okay. i want you to put the - put the tool car- rier right here.
"okay, on 7-10."
we're now passing right ... through scorpio. 222 ay5
"and if there's any - if you - if there's no reason why not, we'd just as soon you go ahead and do the p52 now. finish that off and then start the maneuver. over. cml° okay. the big reason is that gene's getting into his suit right now."
okay. that sounds good. -- transcript of communications between cc and lm resumed apollo 16 air-t0-ground voice transcription

"boy, i - we don't need any hooks; i'll tell you."
"ah, the old orange. okay; get an after of that, john, and a scoop. how about you - swapping, i'll bag, and you rest."
right; we understand. would you verify that you've done the battery management on 3-9?
"okay. 200:07:27, 31:33, 43:09, and 52:48."

"okay, well let's ask the ground. houston, what do you show the cabin pressure?"
wait a minute - high bit rate?
question number 7. you described the lunar rover as a bucking bronco on the moon. would you elaborate and assess the rover's performance and tell us what changes you recommend for the 1972 model?
okay. just leave it open now.
okay. why don't you tell them when they come back up here.
okay! just a minute:
"columbia, houston. if that's not satinfactory, let us know. over."
"what do you mean, your vkf switches are both off?"
okay.
okay.

"no, if you go slow, it doesn't. okay, did you put the optics back up?"
got it all.
"orion, we're finished with your computer."
"by all means, and we are minus 139 on the other flight plan."
(laughter) it looks like everything else around here: full of holes.
"okay, and so what happens - -"
"see where those craters are right there, dick? the taller ones?"
"yes, you do, you've got a different place .... over my head."
"yes, the lineal thing is, right now, perpendicular to the bottom of panel 100."
go.
okay. check the rcs. looking good. eps is looking good.

"15, houston. !"
wait a minute and i'll get you another bag - -
"okay, i copied your - your bit on the screens and we'd like b/d roll for sleep tonight."
"hello, robert."
it acts like it's inherently cohesive. it breaks up in angular fragments.
"how are we doing on the time line, tony?"
"okay, ma - - master arm is on; i have 2 lights. 07 03 36 56 i_-lm average g is on."
"okay. and, houston, can we proceed with our powerdown now? getting the ball back off and aot lamp, et cetera, ac secured."
"it's pretty badly shattered, tony, so i don't know whether it's going to stay together - i don't know whether it's gonna stay together or not."
we got a little time because i've got a lot of jacking to do. man! i - -
okay. go ahead.
okay.
"okay. amp hours, 82 and 80. battery, 122 and off scale low. forwards are 210, 240; rears are 225 and 2 - 220."
"huge vesicles. oh, look at the plagioclase in there. --_ man, look at the laths, jim; it's beautiful. whooo! vesicles in this must be about 2 to 3 inches - -"
i'll have to turn the other way then. _-_
"roger. and delete the update block, the weight block_ and the verb 40 load - verb 48 load. and right under that, put ""mass spec ion source, on."""
huh? oh - -
"and even from this distance. youknow, i'm _lmost to the western edge of crisitun, looking back across there, and even from this distance, you can still see the - the color boundary between the two and as far - it goes up north by posidonius, and then it kind of blends in and it will look - as far as i can tell anyhow. going from posidonius on around to the north side of serenitatis. of course, it's a long ways away, and i really can't see, but i couldn't tell a definite demarcation. it just kind of blended in from the tan to - to the dark tan."
"the reason i say that, joe, it's going to be another 30 minutes or so anyway before we - probably more like an hour before we actually close our eyes."
"okay, we copy that. of the rocks you saw, do you feel like you - you sampled all the representative types?"
and we're t minus 3 white sands and counting.
yes. 04 13 55 46 lmap there it is. pdi preparation to posttouchdown
"okay, src 2 is 41 pounds. scb number 3, which is the containment bag 3, is 30 pounds. scb number 1, _hich is in containment bag 4, is 26 pounds."
"very ineffective, too."
go ahead. we're reading you.
yes. -- 05 23 44 07 lmp-eva - - at ll:30. but i guess our primary objective is the crater.
"that's right. most of the rocks seem - that seems to be what has happened all over the moon that we 'ye looked at. but the rocks are always cleaner than the - than the surface, of course. the - the far rim of camelot - you can see - fact is every- where but where we are and on the rim near the lm - the - there seems - the rim seems to be completely covered or, at least, the blocks don't show through. they show up in the wall but not at the rim. that's much like horatio, but not to the extreme that we saw at horatio. i'd say, at camelot, the mantle is - oh, maybe - at the most - the rim thickness, if that's mantle, is on the order of a half of what we saw at horatio."
...
"okay, gordy. the pre-sps burn sim prep is complete."
i understand the question is what kind of heavy things can you store where the srcs go.
i don't understand why i can't get cool now.
"roger. that's what you have, forward omni."
okay. understand.
"okay, go."
"okay. and at 169:25 we'll up-link you a liftoff refsmmat, and at 169:30, your post-sps-burn sim prep, and that still leaves a gap there of about 3 hours, and that's your - after lopc-1 we don't want to clutter up until we get through with that. but we'll go ahead and give you the rest of the things that fill in here."
"that pit - that central pit goes down about half the depth of the craver, and the crater is a fresh 3-meter crater. that's - it almost was a cylin- drical pit. hey, bob, hole-in-the-wall is a - is just a step - headed down to the south or southeast on the scarp. it's a - scarp is just about what i think we all expected it to be. it's very rolling and relatively smooth. i don't really see any outcrops exposed anywhere out here to the - to the south. t_jmp-eva no. you see, now there's station 3 area right up there."
"what are you doing? oh, you're rolling."
"okay, that first part, ""docked deactivation stage,"" was that just steps 1 through 7 or the whole thing?"
"says if that's successful and we get control, the launch vehicle guidance back to iu; we control pitch and yaw with thc, roll with rhc. allow s-ivb to drift in pitch, gravity gradient. control yaw within platform limits. perform normal procedures except time base 6 minus 15 minutes, maneuver to tli attitude and set up ordeal. hold tli attitude until ignition. null ullage deviations with service module rcs. after ignition, rcs command, off. auto rcs select, 16, main a, main b. manual atti- tude, three, to rate command. after cut-off, go back to cmc. manual attitude, three, accel command. rcs command, on."
"okay at 136: 35, verb 48, (21102) and (01111)."
... coming up on cochise.

"hey - hey, bob, i recommend that if we ever do this again they let me get off and pick the charge off when we want to deploy it. it really adds to the fatigue of the hands."
we're in po0. o0 02 41 56 _ we're in po0. and the - the - -
"sure as hell can. yes, siree, i hope to tell you."
"well, i had to get this - oh, i'm sorry."
successfully.
you know that little crater on the side of the north massif that we're thinking about goin_ to doesn't look nearly as light-colored or haloed as it does in pictures_ does it?
point to earth.
"i can't either, charlie."
at least 92 percent.
"never mind, i'm going to do it with these."
"yeah, we are. looks like we're just about 20 meters from vhe rim."
roger. we see the solar panel.
"apollo ll, houston with a little recovery force information. over."
can you get that last one? my fingers just can't pick it - -
"okay, there you go."
"the only - okay. let me give you that. i just was turning the page. i did have one comment; the first - the first frame on that antisolar sequence, i think is probably not part of the gegenschein experiment itself. i think that's more of this zodiacal light business. but it's a 5-minute ex- posure, and we took it with the spacecraft - let's say my head's down and nearly in the local horizontal. the camera was pointing 30 degrees down, and it looks to me like it would have had the moon in - in earthshine - in the field of view; so i suspect that that's not much of a - not a very good frame. the rest of the sequences went - went fine, and the pointing attitudes pointed us right at the places on the chart. and i have attitude errors on the antisolar sequence. i'll just give you the atti- tudes at the end, and restart it from the proper attitudes. it was 165, 257, and 354. the second part of step 4 was 167, 258, 357. the attitudes in step 7: 169, 264, and 0. attitudes in step 10: 164, 275, and 359. magazine zulu zulu has 15 exposures taken."
"houston, i'm need to process - -"
okay.
"no, they're not, i don't think. i can - i can see from here down to - survey ridge and it is - the albedo on there is a lot lighter. it's a general gradual downslope from our landing point to survey ridge, and it looks like it drops maybe a hundred meters and then starts to go right back up smoky mountain. i guess you could see on a contour map where the low spot is."
okay. how about giving us the range and bearing when you get to it.
we'll turn it on.
who's talking?
"that's correct, ken."
"well, i'll tell you what i'm going to do here, real quick."
jack. the answer to your question is the center spot is weighted for 60 percent of the reading and the rest of it for 40 percent. over.
"yes, we'll put you back on langrenus_ _£nieh is one of the copernican-age craters, in this part of the moon, and i believe it was apollo 12 had an excellent opportunity for some several orbits to study langrenus."
okay ....
"he's breaking now, jerry; i can hear them now."
"()kay. that's it, and that's the whole flight plan update. i have a consumables update now if you want to listen to that."
"*** hard to tell where north is on it, though."
"i'd better be watching the flight plan for this page, because there are a lot of little notes i put in there that -"
"say - say, gene, we don't think it's a problem. we'll find out what it is when you get in. we think we should just press right on with the flight plan checklist and keep going."
"okay, jim."
i might also say that we appreciate the time and effort the pis put in with their experiments and with us also.
"i see one in there that's a millimeter wide by 3 millimeters long, and a - and some other needle- like crystals in it."
it really is neat to have a gravity field around to set stuff on. that is really the cat's meow. (laughter)
"casper, houston. for your information, the lm's about 4 or 5 minutes from hot fire."
"oh, yes; of course. as i recall, he's the only one that really understands thorson."
"okay. let me give you those little guys right now. start with the rcs: quad a, 61 percent; quad bravo, 59; charlie, 66; delta, 67; battery c is 36.5, pyro battery a is 36.7, battery b is 36.7."
huh? 04 03 59 _3 cdr you thrusted toward us 3.5 feet a second. is that true?
okay.
"okay; be assured we're not. there's just a cer- tain amount of housekeeping we have to do. but, very seriously, day after tomorrow is a ve_' zhort day, and i think we ought to look at making up any time. i'm a hold-faster' on sleep periods but tomorrow is the one that i think is flexible."
"that's enough, jack let me -"
what was that?
"okay, bob ...."
"yes, sir. and i hope someday we eau get you all up here too. i - i think we really need to have some good professional geologists up here. as a matter of fact, good professional scientists of all disciplines, not only in lunar orbit, but right on the surface, because you all would just really have a field day, where - with your back- grounds and what you know. there's just so much to be gained up here."
hold it. hold it up in front.
"yes. all we got to do is bring that bank on late, and turn it off early."
"okay, it looks like we're going to maintain about 400 on the surge."
"okay, houston. there's the cabin at 4.6."
okay. let's get grabs before you guys leave.
"you're breaking up again, buzz. 04 14 40 18 _p i say the jets deflector that's mounted on quad seems to be - the surface of it seems lo be more wrinkled than the one that's on quad 1. generally, underneath part of the i_mseems to have stood up quite well to the *** get some pictures in the aft part of the lm that will illuminate the thermal effects much better than we could get them up here in the front."
"okay_ bob. everything is looking go on board. everything's stable. we can see the aps firing, and our altitudes look good."
"okay, sounds good. because i don't know where i - how far i lost you. okay, panel 4; telcomm, group 1, to ac1. on panel 5, close the following circuit breakers: ecs, pressure group 1, main b; ecs, pressure group 2, main b; ecs, temp, main b; ecs, secondary loop tpjj_sducer, main b; ecs rad, control/heaters, main b; bat relay bus, bat b; bat charger, bat b; inverter control, 2; inverter control, 1; eps sensor signal, ac1; eps sensor signal, main b; eps sensor unit, ac1; waste/ potable h20, main b; instrumentation, essential, main b."

roger. go for loi.
"jim, in a moment we will have an attitude for you to go to, and recommend that you keep your fdi up while maneuvering to that attitude. after you get there, then we will have you widen the dead- band and eventually go into a ptc about the burn attitude."
- - ... we'll get a couple of pictures here.
okay. go ahead.
roger.
go ahead.
"roger, troops. we're thinking that when you - -"
"well, you said wash it out, so i left it there. 04 01 29 12 v_w2 oh, okay."
"okays if you can tilt it just u[:slightly, al, that'll be it. that' s good. you got good azimuth on it, now."
"... on 85 now. okay, and tsiolkovsky, we got those the last time with, on the lm mag is that correct?"
"yes, you're probably right."
"(laughter) yes. the dump is off; so if we get one, it'll be soon. now, let - is there anything you want me to check down here? let me look around one last time. see if you see anything floating around. 03 11 11 16 _ i don't see anything."
"okay, i'm going to take her to normal now."
"apollo 16, houston. we need the x-ray off for 2 seconds and then back on."
roger. i understand that; i just wanted to make sure i had a general understanding in case we had to do some original thinking.
"okay. jim, put these back. time skip"
yes.
"orion, houston. apollo 16 air-t0-ground voice transcription 04 21 12 39 i_p-lm ... break it, because there's no way for a human being to get the crinkle out of there because he ain't got three hands. four hands would do a good job. two to hold - one to pull on the zipper and two to hold the crinkle ..."

it's off.
"515, minus 44223."
i got one here.
okay. i'll wake up first.
"well, there's not much that they can find on the ground to fix it, though."

"and, america. your cabin press is at 5.6, and you can crack the side hatch valve, if you like."
"yeah. okay, go ahead,"
"well, let's see here, now. again, we got the csm/lm sep breakers ..."
"shoot, look at it!"
okay. go with your high gain angles.
pretty good - pretty interesting place. very interesting place.
"columbia, this is houston. estimated lm posi- tion is latitude plus 0.799, longitude over 2 plus 11.730. on your chart we would place it - stand by on the charts and readback on the latitude and longitude."

"no, that's all right. 05 12 52 07 _p ..."
"okay. now, guess who's watching to see how these hooks are going to work?"

"and i didn't park that rover in a very good spot for them to watch what's going on, i guess; but that was the heading."
"okay. and i'll - standing by to read you some more photo pads, just at your convenience."
"oh, we're nc_s on vox."
"okay. let's see about 5 - now here again is where sun angle may make a little bit of difference on the thing. but this kind of a hummocky, well, close to sculptured-hill-type of material that we are flying over between proclus and macrobius a and b, doesn't look at all like the sculptured hills in the landing site area, next to - in other words, all along the edge of crisium, or the edge of serenitatis you have the sculptured-hills effect that have the vertical, dark lineations·in it. these vertical, radial or whatever you want to - lineations, striations, i guess, dark striations are not apparent under the western edge of crisium at all. where does this come out by the landing site? north of the landing site?"
"okay, joe; i have the polarimetric filter."
"you need some more bags, john. 06 03 g0 48 cdr-eva yep."
"i think that'll stop a lot of it, houston."

"well, john picked up one just like it up on - it was a grab sample up on sto - yes, stone mountain. and it was one of the crystalline rocks with that sugary crystalline texture to it. huh? yeah. and it was one of those whitish rocks that was a little dusty. i think that - i think it's fairly common. we'll just have to see when we get the samples back, but it was my impression it was one of the three predominant rock types there."
i've already got it.
"okay. it's still about 2.9 g's. took some more pieces off the outside of the spacecraft. hey, it didn't stay on there very long. okay."
what am i going to run it to?
"and, endeavour; houston. over."

"okay. bravo, 0mni; track, manual; and beam, wide."
i can get one last pan here.
"what that's doing is zeroing the cdus. and that - that guarantees you a fail. okay, and as - as soon as you get the accurate time on that, we'll do a - a verb 40 enter, and wait l0 seconds for the cdus to recover."
"america, houston. after we start the p_ c_e_'a av 233:48:15, we would like then to go and s_arc to retract h? an%enna number 2. number 2 first, please. cyfp okay. as soon as i get the pan camera svarled, we'll go to retract on _hat."
"okay, hadley. first thing we'd like is hi bit rate. that will allow us to look at some extra parameters, particularly temperature, to see how much of this fall is due to temperature effects, which we haven't experienced before. so, if you're standing right there, why don't you flip that on while i read you the rest of the pad, jim."

"oh, we're taking stock of how much we got there, maybe sort of think about rationing some of it. i mean just to make sure we've got enough to last us and that we get enough water out. i'd hate to run out of water on the last day. take a look and see how much we got, and fill them up and just hold them there. yes, and i'll tell you the stuff that's good to eat now will be the candies, the sandwich spreads. maybe the freeze - the dehydrated stuff. if you have to rehydrate it, it'd be kind of difficult. no, wet packs are good."

what stuff? i don't transfer any stuff over any more. 03 17 19 22 _ sure do. 03 17 19 23 cimp you already transferred it.

i just fussed 39 degrees. i'll wait for it next time around.
"okay, we'd like you to drive gingerly up to the alsep area there, and we're going to ask you to hold the end of that broken cable up in front of the tv and that will be the station 10 parking area. and then you can do the station 10 tasks down to the south - correction - up to the northeast."
"no. we have b and a, and - and that one, and there's another one that was good in there."
yes.

"houston, rock box 2's going onto the y-pad with the mylar or whatever you - film or whatever you call that stuff off the s-band antenna, going on t°_f_it."
you should be out of film in the dac.
very good.
"is that the time frame you - ? okay. that time frame was - i would guess it was about a minute, tony. because when i tapped it, i just couldn't get them to move. i had already - i had already tapped that thing once before, for the bubbles, and - because when - as soon as we unpacked it, we saw the bubbles out there, and i banged it a little bit to try and see if i could get them to move and didn't have any luck at alii. so we didn't wait any 3 or 5 minutes, it - it was about 2 min- utes, i guess."
"okay, we - we got to get the - -"

no.

okay.
"ron, is there a difference in the color between the dome and the mare in aitken, there? c_ yes, there - yes, there is. the dome-type mate- rial is - the colors again are very hard, you know? i'm just going to have to say that it's - it's slightly darker than the mare floor - is the way it looks to me, right at this point in time. also, the texture is a coarser texture than the floor itself, in other words, the floor, to me, is kind of a standard mare flat-floor-type stuff. and i have to compare the texture of the domical hills to - oh - i guess what i would imagine is some of the dacite flows that i've seen out in california. you know, the heavy viscous-type flows."

"hey, it sure didn't, did it?"

"apollo 11, this is houston. when you stop at 0 roll, you will be in approximately 90 pitch, 0 yaw, and 0 roll. we'd like you to run the (goss net 1) tape 47/7 first p52, that is, the p52 option b, from that attitude. then we'll uplink you a new refsmmat, either before or while you are mrneuvering to 000, and then you can torque the platform around and run the second refsmmat. over. run the second p52. over."

and dog 4.
"oh, okay. cml° you know, houston, we're jus_ passing over a little polygonal crater that's maybe 15 kilometers in diameter - 15, 20 kilometers in diameter. it may be 10 to 15 - and down in the basin of it is a kind of a polygonal fill. it, again, has that dark greenish-black rock that is collected down at the bottom of it, and you also see it streaking down the side of it. but, i think one of the most significant features about the crater itself is that it has a swir!_ and these are honest to good- ness - they look like swirls rather than rays. it has a swirl pattern around there - it's radial, from that most recent impact."
okay. hold it there. 04 04 22 48 cml> ... okay. holding at b.

"oh, that's the problem."
"okay. if you've got the flight plan out, we go over to 271 hours. and at 271:20, just under s-band ox tv science, we add v_b 49, maneuver to contamina- tion photo attitude. the attitude is 014, 195, 016; high gain, pitch, minus 23; yaw 252."

"and that's no problem, cnarlie."
"oh, okay."
copy that.
keep it up.
"okay. gee, you're loud and clear. how's - bow's america looking to you? yes, we got a beautiful bird down here. we'll - we'll see you up there shortly."
"ah, this is going to be some kind of different ride! 04 23 37 02 iai-eva the rover is running, houston."
we got our drogues?
yes.
okay. turn around.
okay. · cdr-eva that'll do it.
"okay, go to it, ken."
"15, we'll clear it. don't worry."
"aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle is in the min position."
"okay. and second one is with respect to the optics cals. and i guess we should explain here that - people who are wringing their hands down here about the fact that we looked at a little bit of a bias drift when you guys zeroed the optics the first day, and we sent up some procedures yesterday say- ing to be careful when you are doing it for p23. and then everybody else got - decided that we ought to be careful when we did it for other things be- sides p23. and so, we have the following procedures, which are, basically, to avoid trunnion rates for all optics zeroing, so that we don't get any - pos- sible shift on the mirror calibration. and the procedures are nwofold. first i guess you might write them down some place -- if the optics power is off, place zero switch off before turning the optics power on. and then, after the power is on, drive the optics manually to a trunnion of less than l0 degrees before placing the zero switch on. over. 02 22 39 28 _ okay, bob. if optics power off, then optics zero switch, zero?"
the burn was 4 seconds off. loi 1.
um-h_ml.
"okay, i was setting up my rock hole and all that - good things for the polarizing light. and - say, i was looking at a rock that has small crystals in it. one of them is shining very, very bright green, like ginger-ale-bottle green."
secondary.
okay.
"well, they seemed to do all right for us. i guess that's the way. we were half-way thinking, but not thinking very well, as was witnessed in our checklist procedures tonight."
"mark. duke - bright dot, lower center, right eye."
"roger, houston. apollo 11 calling in from about 130 000 miles out. and we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. over. o1 10 00 d6 cc roger."
"aquarius, we read you 4 by 4. go ahead."
"oh, boy. all over (laughter). gosh."
that's right.
"okay. we'll give it a try again, i did a 1-£oo_- i per-second radial in towards the moon. oh 06 52 29 cc and, kef; in addition to the pads, i also have you los an! aos time. 02 06 52 45 c_p okay. 04 06 53 _7 cc casper, houston. how do you read?"
"the blocks are angular, but they are definitely coming out of buster."

okay?
... myrtle here.
go to the - go to the technique for a lash and ... it's the burn technique.
okay.
and at 4g's. minus ll0.
"pretty sporty there, jim."
"0h, okay. you have accept."
"leave it here. we'll play games with the extension handle, but that's all right. okay; let me set them over here. *** big bag. all those - the lrv ' sampler anymore."
"okay, jack. do you read now?"
stand by.
"tvc gi5_al drive, pitch and yaw, auto."
verify mtvc.
"okay, bob, i'll get a sample - i'll doc - i'll sample it by hand. but it'll be documented. and i'll get it in a bag in a minute since i don't have any."
"okay, ll3, ll4, and ll5 were taken on the western edge of serenitatis. i'll get unwound from the cord here in a little bit and i'll (laughter). you know if we design another spacecraft, we got to have something with a - so you don't have to be tied up to this crazy cord."
"okay. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription 0© 21 10 24 lmp bob, you with me?"
it's not coming out; i guarantee you that. no ... take your - -
i got them. zero - -
"*** okay, that looks like 2 scoopsfuls [sic] going into bag 346."
"dave, while he's pitching, i'll tell you - should be about the middle of the sim bay by the mapping camera."
"put it back on, i do. got to be a bear to get back up there, you know."
"bob, you got any - bob, you got any preference up in this area where you want that long can?"
that's bad because every time you bend over like that you put a strain on that eva antenna - plss antenna.
(singing) i'm getting it right now. *** anything else you want me to do while i'm here?
"apollo 15, houston."
roger.
"roger, ll. we've - could you attempt a little bit better focus there, ll? over."
"okay. ail right. the event timer is set; space- craft control is cmc and auto, we've maneuvered to the pad burn attitude; sextant star check, pass; we _re p40 to the 50 18; gdc is alined 000. i have rechecked my circuit breakers twice. let me do it for three times."
...
"thank you, jack."
"we ought to be able to work in a minute. okay. the present warning status is good. we have a water sep light, preamps, ecs. confidenti,, j"
"gave you another easy one, h_h?"
that's affirmative. it's very close to the honey- suckle base - -
"okay, the first star: the corrected altitude, 15 kilometers plus or minus 4; effective altitude, 12 kilometers plus or minus 7. as far as the substellar point, the value is arc-minutes - 2 arc-minutes, and that's very good. and, like i said, we'll get back with you in a couple of hours for the rest."
"roger; no hurry. 06 19 4b 27 cdr-eva is that the bslss lock on the - you said the left side or right? oh, it is - i see it. _--_ 06 19 43 b2 i_p-eva left side. 06 19 43 b3 cdr-eva i can get it. 06 19 4b b4 lmp-eva what? 06 19 43 b5 cdr-eva i can reach that. 06 19 43 b6 lmp-eva if you can reach around the - if you want, i - i could - 06 19 4b b8 cdr-eva no, i can get it."
(laughter)
ro_er. we're locking up now. e confidentia 07 03 48 39 c_ roger. got good signal strer_th on you.
i think i'll wait for the burn.
73 is minus.
"and, jim. be advised that that empty core tube - -"
"okay. go ahead. now, bring up the lights. wow!"
(laughter) hang in there. 153 is the attitude.
"the back room would like you to kind of concen- trate on looking on that dike, if it is at all possible, ron. even if you have to use - -"
that's beautiful.
"roger. referring to the procedure on g/8-2, if you have that open, i'll tell you what we had to give you."
"okay. on this pass, the moon came into view at the top part of the lmp's window, came across higher. jim estimates the lpd angle at a minus 15 degrees. 'i'a_e72/6 0_ 11 45 09 cc okay. a minus 15 on the moon, and sounds like it's set up pretty well."
"okay. i don't think we're going to have a - remeet- ing problem here, but we're pointed right at him and as i look at him on my lpd - ken is out at 46 degrees and about - oh, i'd say 800 or 900 feet, maybe a thousand."
is that all?
"okay, it's in standby. i'll get - pan camera mode is in standby and the power is coming on -"
"vertical. okay, helmet and visor, alined and adjusted. 06 _9 07 12 lmp-lm okay, it is. 06 19 07 13 cdh-lm 02 connectors, three, locked."
roger. i'm looking at the right side of the screen this time.
"go forward omni, orion. 04 01 02 22 _ okay_ jim, you have forward omni. how do you read?"
okay; we're a-2.
"america, this is houston."
... that's fine.
?nat's difficult ***. it's so tender up here on these legs. 04 20 07 24 _p yes. i know.
"yeah, that's true. it's much better driving. we're doing 10 clicks. 06 22 16 _1 cc outstanding. could we have a - an _ reading?"
"that's good then, i'll get that going; let's - -"
okay.
"well, i can; my darn - both hands are all -"
"and, 17. jack, we'd like you to check the sep for us. i suspect we'll have to turn it off and open the mirrors and dust them."
"16, houston, we got a ~ an answer to your question about the wrist rings on your suit."
"give me a mark. i'm waiting. '04 02 25 43 cdr 3, 2, 1 -"
"and, 15, i have a tei-4 pad for you any time that you have time to copy it."
"thrust, on."
"and, ken, the next change is at 146:27; we want to delete all the little business there with the ""gamma ray gainstep - on (up) 4 steps (step 7)/ shield-on (center)."" delete that whole line. okay. the next change is at 146:30. at the top of the page. this is a minor change. the sim experiment status should now be ""plus llll and 02222."" and if you'll flip the page over at 147 hours, the sim status should be the same as before: ""plus llll, 02222."" at 147:12, delete ""image motion - on,"" delete ""mapping camera - on (t-start),"" and also de3[ete that block for the photo pad - mapping camera photo pad. okay, on the next page, at 148 hours, right at the top of the page, we want to add ""_ ray, retract, to 7-1/2 feet."" the time for the retraction is 2 minutes 26 seconds. at 148:05, add ""pan camera, standby; stereo; power- verify; pan camera, operate at t-start."" and, ken, somewhere out beside that, you can build you a little block, if you like, to copy the pan camera photo pad."
"oh, look at what i got! you wouldn't believe it_ okay, pick up the etb."
f-stop.
it's open.
"no, that won't - -"
"that's from station 9, right? lmi°-eva yes."
okay. 05 05 15 10 i_-eva and it packs easier that way.
"houston, we just wanted you to know that the heart rates that you're seeing or not seeing are due to the exercise period - not the iss light."
"wait, wait, wait, wait. 04 19 _9 11 lmp you ready now?"
"okay, houston. sim sec ac 2 circuit breakers, three, closed, verified. and the pan camera mode switch's in standby. so would you like us to go to step 3?"
"houston - well, i don't know - -"
okay.
"jack, houston. let us watch that for another minute or so."
"and, bob, there was something interesting i wanted to get around to tell you. the - mission timer down in the i.rr,when ron went down there to get things squared away, was about 15 seconds or so behind all the other elocks."
... you're moving across that surface.
hang on. they're out. i see two of them.
... about i mile short.
"scb-4 will go on jack. jack, i got to get these *** straps, too. did you get mine? *** harness release straps?"
"- - what you face to the sun, doesn't it?"
"al, we're ready to have gamma ray gainstep back to cent er."
"why don't you leave that the_e for a minute? okay. what did you say about the tge, bob?"
"h2 purge line heaters, off. 09 05 _9 08 cmp all you got to do is look after the purge, huh?"
"ail right, back off."
"oh, we've got to turn the camera around too, jim."
"no, i sure don't, charlie."
the same.
okay. i think those things are going to be kind of hard to see. but we'll try.
got it off?
"circuit breaker first. cabin repress, open."
"okay, jim_ we're on 8-12 waiting to don our helmets and gloves in about 20 minutes. _i- 06 57 _8 cc r<ger. we're following you. 07 06 5'_04 cdr-lm ,tim, what does ... say on our consu___able sta_ _. 07 06 5{i 24 cc roger. you look great on consumables, f,ct-_a] i_'_ you have about 15 hours left on your eleetri_:, and about 10 more pounds of water. over. kcuh: you like to do a fourth eva?

mark cdr.
yes. you going to need the scissors?
work it out towards you - because of the cap. see what i mean ?
"well, where's the jett bag? let's put it in the jett bag."
"okay, ron, we're standing by for any comments along your ground track here and we're following you. we would like to - when you get up on the landing site, we'd like you to concentrate on stoney and f cra - f crater for those textural differences we noticed the other day."
okay.
"ron, the high gain angles look good. go na_rrow and reacq, and we should have you."
okay. let me get over here.
"well, i'd rather have a timer going so that we - what are we going to put in the dsky? should we shut down the mission timer? 02 11 10 37 i2_p is that what you want to do?"
"rcs systt_ a/b - two quads, off."
"and, gordy, it's gray. would you like me to cycle it?"
i'll give you the coordinates in a minute.

"okay, fred. we're in noisy comm here; i got descent 1 fuel 66.5; stand by a second."
"- - heading is 264, if you can believe such a thing."
"yes, well, even that ... that's why we had trouble finding anything at all that we could use, because there isn't anything."
"go ahead, houston."
tell them we are.
yes.
"endeavour, we have a small series of updates here, if you're ready to copy."
in nv pocket (laughter).
okay.
"i'm not going to do a thing, mike. i'm just let- (eagle) ting her hold in attitude hold. 05 07 57 40 c_ okay. (col_ia"
mark cdr.
okay.
"yeah, you know they have no idea where we are."
"apollo 16, houston."
... total.
"okay. set the refsmmat flag for g&c 7-1, steps 3 and 4."
"okay, just stand by. we're looking at it."
okay. that's - -
roger.
"don't go too far out, though."
"pitch2, off."
"okay, houston; aquarius."
"pete, go ahead."
"houston, here's the crew of apollo - apollo 17, spaceship america."
"roger. copy that. copy you're right on the rim, and we'd like to get a good _j check and a rest here before you proceed."
"roger, al. and, just a couple of questions they have up now. they'd like your note, if you do see any dust, particularly on the top surfaces of boulders in the - in the area. and, any compari- sons between the boulders you see distributed around. are they all the same or do some t_pes appear different?"
but i said - you didn't hear me say it?
"roger. and at the termination - or at 270: 30, we want you to _mmediately maneuver to the skylab attitude, skylab contamination, and, as soon as you get in attitude, do the photo sequence b - skylab contamination photo sequence b - and skylab dump sequence. and do those as quickly as possible. and, in the dump sequence, number 3, it now reads ""do it 30 minutes after sequence 1."" make that ""15 minutes after sequence 1."" l0 04 01 36 c_ okay; we'll stay with sco x-1 until 270:30. then we'll go to skylab photo sequence b_ and we'll press right through that and the dump sequences. and we'll do dump sequence number 3 at 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes, and we're ready to press on."
ot_y.
"okay, and we'll do that now. 3-a8 i confidentti '04 20 54 13 i_p (hum_ming) okay. pull it - feet, out this way. and ... straight; plane *** 04 20 57 17 i2(? okay, houston. the second geop::.one is in. an'- was a little hit overly optimistic about the ease w_.h which they could be put in. th,e tension cf the cable is such that it didn't: wart tc ail ow the gcc?hone tc hang straight. ratker %he - set in the cable. 04 20 57 39 i2_ the geopkone isn't heavy enough to straighten it out."
- - over the - the lip right now?
"okay, i have - oh - look at this, jim."
okay. can we hold off on the sim bay status? and i'll copy your three short items.
okay. that's the 02 ... h20 comp light.
okay; that's a lot better.
yes.
"roger. we've finished picking up data on the mass spectrometer. leave the d_scriminator as it is, and we're ready to go to put the experiment in standby now."
that's right - -
(laughter)
"okay. looking up on the south massif, we've got real good views of the block-strewn fields. there's one tha% - there seems to be two dominant colora- tions of the rock. the light-colored ones, very - very light tan and to white, and then there are the blue-gray rocks. there's one major outcrop of blue gray about a sixth of the way down the slope, the center of the field of view we have; and it looks very much like similar blue-gray l'oek_ right at the crest, the highest point from our vantage point. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay, dave; copied that. sounds great."
no.
"yes. i'll make it a full pan. so darn far out, i might as well. nftdientt"
roger.
"you say, you figure you are going to be charging bat a until about 1267"
"okay, got that one. go ahead. 06 05 54 3i cc okay. you spoke of a crater on the northeast side of tsiolkovsky's rim, and you said it had a fault line. could you mark that on your map, also?"
"look at that - look at those - look at the rocks around there, charlie. 09 23 ,_8 ;?4 i/4p-eva i know it. o) 23 ?8 _6 cdr-eva there's your basalts and things. those are black. they're probably glass covered, don't you think? 05 23 28 31 imp-eva they are. i picked up one out there. see where my footprints go?"
"roger. that's the end of the tv show, we've got some work to do."
"gordy - gordy, and you know it's satisfying to have put that much time in and - and come out with some meaningful results. that makes us ail feel good. have you been able, or did you see that first charge on the video?"
"no, i just feel like my suit is pressurizing more. what are you guys looking at down there on the ground?"
"doesn't seem to have hi - has hills that look like king. and you find all these color variations up here; they're really associated with the craters for the most part. they look like swirls, but they really are associated with craters. now i think that i'm looking at right below me - stuff like just very light, dusty patterns that are laid out on the surface that really aren't associated with swirls or any such thing. time skip"
i don't know who the hell is going to do it for you.
how did the landing site look through the sextant?
why don't we do a quick sample?
"yeah. wait a minute. i'm not sure it was all the way open. yeah, it's open, charlie; it's all the way open."
that's right. yes.
give me that ... throw away.
got it.
... one.
"0kay_ and z took the trim maneuver in ?40 and i_ put that bias to attitude b, 90 degrees roll, 139 pitch, and 1.7 in yaw, and that's about right, considering the roll."
"okay, just don't call it the reefer. okay. at about ei minus 19, we get back into the standard entry checklist on page?2-2, where it starts with p61."
...
roger. it's on the way.
"okay, dave. and, incidentally, can you give us any sort of report on that number 5 window?"
is it off the case?
"towards me. towards the - look - slight dust but not much, it's okay."
"okay, dps burn card."
"you can time it, al. take 5 percent of the total, times the 24 frames per second."
"okay, very good. _"
"okay. boy, i tell you, looking to the east, you might just well forget it."
"okay, dave. and we do have one question regarding the burn. on our data down here, we saw the thrust light go off right after the burn for about 7 seconds and wondered if you noticed the same thing up there."
"aquarius, houston. we have 10 seconds until 9 minutes to the burn. 3, 2, 1 -"
it's - yeah - how about that? they work'
"okay. s-band mode is to voice, squelch is - says ""off""; i'm want to leave it enabled. crew report, i'll get in a minute and wind your watch."
"appropriately, finally we're getting - we're starting to use it during the christmas season. it sure looks like a christmas package with all the orange tape on it."
"okay; 21129 and 22060. (no comm for 18 minutes) 07 05 00 27 i2_p-i2_ okay, tony. orion here. we've got the scbs in the sample containment bags; 7 is in 7, 6 is in 6, 4 is in 8. over. 07 05 00 h2 cc roger. jim's on now, charlie. give me those bag numbers again. and we have some information for that weight suzmt_afyfor you. 07 05 00 54 i2_p-lm okay. scb-7 is in sample containment 7. scb-6 is in sample containment 6. scb-4 is in sample con- tainment 8. over."
all right .... down.
"you're over in the area between guam and the carolines, then. you're saying it would be just about due west of the carolines, then."
roger. just did it. 09 03 53 -- begin lunar rev 73
okay.
i think i'm getting smarter about 1/6g.
"yes, ken. it was, i heard about it."
"roger; understand, and you've got accept."
i guess just - if you want just crew status report - doing just fine. i don't know what else i can say.
"you can just read it off your cuff, man."
"106. yes, i'll just put a verified by that; 106:51."
okay.
"houston, aquarius. 05 17 16 h9 cc go ahead, aquarius."
"okay. fine. and when you get reaay to drive off there, we'd like - -"
okay. let me look at the target again. 54829313. targeting is still good. okay.
"yes, sir. we sure can."
okay.
"okay; you ready, jim? i'll work my way down. okay, it's reading 4. 0kay."
"i0n source, on."
"hey, ken. with all of that, now while ago you t_lked about some casperellos - with all that beta candle and all that food, you don't have any such thing as a casperette, do you?"
"okay. minus l0 pitch, plus 350 yaw, and wide beam width and going into auto. you want high gain, john?"
"right; put - put number 3 in the tool w ratchet, and insert - sert tool 3 in the hex opening in the chlorine injector port."
and one more item. you can start to charge bat b - at your convenience.
it is.
"it's always been m_ understanding that it wouldn't. it's not long enough anyway, i don't think."
we will.
you might try the -
"regular what? 04 04 15 46 c_lp because if we still have a chance at landing, then i need to ... to you - -"
okay.
... verb 67.
"well, let's make it 30 centimeters down from the rim."
there you go.
okay.
"okay, we're ... time skip 06 18 48 08 2p houston, apollo 14. time skip 06 20 29 0_ lb_ roger. that's what i understand as a normal acqui- sition, but i - i thought i heard the word reacq couple of times, implying a position of the anten- na, and i was confused on that one. 06 20 49 25 lnp okay, houston. day 8"
"houston, this is 15 with the prds - readings."
got it?
all i can say is it's better than walking.
yes. yes.
"it shuts itself off when it gets above 108, so it's no good anyway."
"roger, we _oncur, ken. we'll remind you."
"well, that - that's true. we were just trying to save you a maneuver. we got to stop the roll and start the roll again to get back to another spot. but, we 'll go that way. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"it won't back off, joe. it turns the drill, and it'll turn the stem, but the chuck won't back off."
"okay. next, ""transmitter/receiver, secondary; power amp, secondary; voice, down voice backup; pcm, pcm, range, 0ff."" okay, then down about five lines there, tim biomed, where it says ""off,"" should be ""left,"" and three lines below there, where it says ""recorder, on,"" should be ""off."" 05 l0 29 45 i_mp-im okay, copy. s-band to pm; power amp to secondary; transmitter/receiver, secondary; down voice backup; pcm to pcm; ranging off, tet.emetry, left; and recorder, scratch."
...
you've still got some particles dangling along with you.
"okay. okay. let me write that down. 04 08 44 56 lm2d doggone, this 1/6th is about as had as zero. things really float around."
okay.
i have never seen so much dirt and dust in my whole life. *** not going to be able to see either one of these helmet visors.
"okay. is it true of the - of the hatch window also, ken? you know that's the one we tal_ed about that looks like - you're bound to be able to see more than - -"
it really makes a - give - give me a thing.
"must not have the mag in there right because it's not running. 06 01 04 ot cdr-eva can't fix it without getting out. don't, don't. let's - let's worry about that when we get to the station."
okay.
okay.
check your antenna?
"go ahead, 15."
roger.
ali right.
"*** ed. and *** we need to move on here to b; and before we depart a, we're going to need an hu[u check."
tli comes - time base 6 comes - -
that's the one you have to strain to make out.
okay. i'll get a camera.
the drive power to bus baker - rear drive power.
roger.
"we'll _ake the high gain, dave."
"which one? the gold visor? no, he said his sun- shade is sticking halfway down, but his gold visor's not."
fantastic. no way ... everything ... run perfect.
okay. and a rake might be useful -
and we're concentrating pretty hard.
"okay, bob. we copy all that. obviously, you're going to have to catch us in real time on some of the details there - on the charges and the task deletion. one question, did you say we were going to delete the trench at station 3?"
no.
all right.
"aquarius, houston. over."
okay.
"okay, and we're just getting it in a little closer. okay, the _xt item on the check - checklist here is an ei minus 40; we're going to panel 7, and it's _ag number 2 power to warm up."

"okay. i'll give you all the story on the aps module problem. evidently aps module number 2, which is our one on top of the vehicle, the one that would cause you to pitch away from the earth; the primary helium regulator there has failed to the backup, and the backup isn't regulating prop- erly. normally, it should hold around 190 psi. this pressurizes both fuel and oxidizer. and it has gradually increased now up around the 320 range. and there's a relief valve which will relieve helium pressure at 325 and reseat when the pressure gets down to 225. there should be a gradual loss of helium. we'll have a better hack at the states pass as to when you could expect a deplete. but should you lose control in orbit, go to the proce- dure on l/2-10 for service module rcs control of the s-ivb. over."

"hello, boss, how are you doing down there?"
"okay, the reason for these changes, charlie, is after we watch mc-6 and look at the system pres- sures there, we got some new data; and, for your information, we're kind of predicting that your nominal values are going to be oxidizer 200, fuel 170, and - for your onboard readings. so based on that, we need to change these burn rules. and i believe you've already made one change to it, is that correct?"
tone's off.
okay. there's 0.5 foot per second radial out.
"i may not - i may not even tell. it does not - none of the material in this core, in either the top section or the bottom section, look unlike that - that stuff just beneath the surface that we sampled at that special stop back there. it's a bluish-gray, and it tends to clod and break up in your hands. and that's core 31 - the num- ber is 31."

where did they come from? 04 00 52 29 imp right over there on your panel.
"okay. that's the configuration we want you in, and here's what we're thinking about. when we went to tank 1 auto, tank 2 off; we found that the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi, which is well above the caution and warning limit, and if we go to that configuration for sleep, we'll keep from getting caution and warning lights dltring the sleep cycle. okay. in order to do that comfortably, we want to spend the rest of the day using more h2 out of tank number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll all come out even. and that's why we have you in t_k 1 off, tank 2 auto, now. we expect to get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next 10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to reverse the configuration again. now the only disadwmtage here is that, during tile day, you will probably get a few caution and warnings, and we just figured it would be better to get them now than while you were sacked out. over."

(hl_mm_ug) i found a brown rock that i'm going to bring back.
"bob, are you going to want to do that again tomorrow?"
you know it's not real obvious whether i see the end point of that'strip. the thing we've drawn i think i see - but it looks like an awful lot of other craters in this low sun. we'll have to wait until a higher sun to see if it really is different.

"and, as you probably noticed there, we used that little adaptive short p23 erasable program, which is really swift; that thing just fires these things off, and i don't feel like in any way we're having to take short cuts on the pointing accuracy. the only time it takes now is to dress up the sub- stellar point on initial acquisition. that's what we're doing now, and it seems to take quite a while."
i know it.
we'll head 140 from here.
wait a minute; we got that in the med kit in the - -
"oh, i'm pretty sure i got them in, joe. i was reading all that stuff out to you. i hope - got a chance to copy it all."
"go ahead, jim."
"okay, jack. the three comments are: assumes burn undocked. assumes no circ burn. and the moon at tig, the longitude'il be minus 1_0.19 de- grees. over. irp okay. i got everything but number 2. all right, here's your readback. tei-12, 12, that is; sps/g&n; 38570; plus 0._9, plus 0.92; 111:5_:_2.86_ plus 25_3.8, minus 1765.6, minus 0795.0. 186, 109, 328. sirius and - rest of the pad is na. sirius and rigel; 133, 200, 030. ullage is four jets for 12 seconds. remarks: 1, burn undocked; 2, assume no circ; 3, longitude - lunar longitude at tig, minus 1_0.19 degrees, .19 degrees."
zipping what?
al?
okay. gimbal motors number 1.
...
"well, i guess we better get to cracking, troops. i'w_ got to put your 160 pounds of rocks some place."
okay.
"that's affirmative, buzz."
on.
... it's a russian crater.
we better park in this boulder field here.
"that's affirmative. okay, now we're going to panel 5, and it's circuit breaker g&n, computer, main b, closed. 05 06 4].21 cmp okay. panel 5: cb g&n, computer, main b, closed. 05 ()641 '55 cc that's affirmative. now you're _oing. to come up with a 37 enter 06 enter most likely on t_:,: eoynt_ut¢;r.axle]what w_ w_mt to do is to i_ut the computer to ::taadby; if'yo_j_ome up with a 37 06, you']] have to do an enter in order to get the code 62. if fit'sgot 62 on it, you can do a proceed until the dsky blanks. you might remember that the ac _s still off at this time so you won't be getting the standby status light, and your cue that the computer is indeed in standby is when the dsky goes blank. 05 06 42 ]6 cmp okay. you're saying that i will probably get a program 06 with a verb 37 enter flashing. 05 06 42 ?7 cc i expect that you - - 05 06 42 2it cmp enter 06."
"needless to say, you don't have to put your dust covers on, jack. if that makes you feel better."
can you see it from here?
yeah.
do i need the tongs?
roger. we were just about to send you up some items of information pertaining to the burn. are you ready to copy? 01407 43 13 lmp stand by.
three. 17
"okay. sounds good. 01 lb 44 31 cdr gordy, the reason i asked about that view of the earth, we were sort of thinking maybe we might go early, if it was all right with you, and watch the earth a little bit more."
squelch?
yes.
okay; scb-7 goes under your seat.
"crystals here; don't lose it. okay, that was about - it's about where we - no, i guess not."
"that's right, al. and we want you to proceed with f- your 02 fuel cell purge listed at 193 plus 58 in the flight plan."
"you have accept. and you want these fuel readings? i'm not sure they're valid, but it's 31.8 oxidizer, 32.8 on fuel, and a balance is now showing a minus - a decrease of 275, but we made the burn in the fixed position with secondary valves and normal position."
say again.
"houston, this is apollo 16.... pdi. we'd like to try."
we got to pitch to 152.
okay. let's go ahead.
"okay, stand by 1."
"at 59:55, we're going to be ..."
where is it?
okay.
okay.
"possibility here - careful, geno. f--"
"what's the name of that crater again, ken?"
"yes, i think so. oh."
"apparently, we'd like them again the - the - this morning on the schedule."
"okay s jack, are you -"
hmm.
"okay, dave. what we'd like is power, on, also, pan camera pow_, on, for 5 minutes."
"oh, relax."
"that's just fine. we'll do it, 246:15. thank you."
"okay. i got two of them in there, too. lm:°-eva great."
we still have the core tube - tubes in here.
and -
forward omni.
0.2.
"okay, there's a big rock on - that i've already described. did you get the ... there, john."
pro.
look at the cliffs.
"yes, we are, joe. i got that ..."
roger that.
"ron, everything is looking great down here. it was a really great day, really busy. we're sorry about that eat period; and it's been real - lot of - lot of things accomplished."
stand by 1.
(laughter) afraid i don't know whether or not there's any weather down there.
"okay, so i got those in - -"
"and, dave, a - we - our telemetry says that the optics power is still on, and i'd like to remind you to turn it off."
okay. it went to standby at 30.
wait a minute. you've got to do the eva warning tone check first.
"yeah, that ought to be enough."
roger. coming up on t2.
"okay. here's the r,mmer."
yeah.
gee! i think one of the big things that impressed me was the - how instantaneous the decelerations were of each one of the boosters when they cut off. that included the s-iv tli cut-off. no physical appreciation of tailoff at all.
"well, i think you're closing, but i sure can't tell it - -"
copy.
california looks nice. the san joaquin valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it. you can't tell that it's green. it looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue.
"joe, i guess you g%_fsare tired of looking at my heart beat. so, i'm god_ua turn the biomed off as i get out of my suit."
...
"houston, 15. go ahead with your mapping and pan camera photo patchup."
"okay. ?ivching now. 07 05 2_ 59 _ do you wan_ to ?at the cqas in the overhead win jew c 07 05 29 0! cdr yes_ i'll _st it, _ust a mi.*:ute, 07 05 29 04 i2_f_f :}kay, endearour, i'm gc,irg to yaw left i20."
strictly up ... skiing.
"- - h-dot's slightly high, but okay."
"- - our tv camera's starting to warm up consider- ably. we'd like for you to clean off the camera top and the lcru when convenient, please."
yes.
"okay, we'll take that over in the command module, karl. we'll go ahead and power the lm down now and clean up the housekeeping, and see you on the other side."
"houston, 15."
"roger. 04 12 41 25 cmp-cm you're loud and clear. 04 12 44 58 iamp-lm roger, america. have a good burn. you look just as pretty in earthlight as you do in sunlight."
how did i do that?
"mark it. power is on on the pan camera. okay, houston, we're waiting your cue on the power."
"regulator check. 03 23 47 52 imp okay. i'm going to go to push-cabin. i don't understand that noise, but - -"
okay.
yes. okay. see if you can get back in your corner.
"number - number 7, houston."
okay.
that's bad news.
"right on. 06 19 49 02 i2_p-eva got a lot of sample bags, dave. i'm going to put the extra ones under my seat."
good thing we're well coordinated human beings.
i've sort of lost track - -
"if anybody ever said ... spacecraft ... with a 134-pound backpack on your ... and i said aw, get serious."
i got it. lm2_-eva see the instant rock.
don't move it until i see it.
"that ... - what number is it? 04 07 04 2t cdr it's 9, ..."
"oh, and then cdr doffing biomed harness. donning. alpha x-ray. let's get a little sim bay and then eat. eat and then we do a canister change, you do a little p23 stuff. then we'll get ready to go to bed."
"all right. 03 04 53 19 cml° houston, apollo 11. how about coming up with some roll, pitch, and yaw angles in which to stop this so-called orb rate that i'm doing."
"or better yet, what was the distinction between the sculptured hills and the subfloor area?"
"oh, for goodness sakes. okay. how man - how far, ken?"
in here?
"go ahead, gordo."
okay.
roger. copy.
"i really think we ought to let that all get out of here before we try to take our helmets and gloves off, if we can - if we can possibly help it. golly, what an approach angle; 68 degrees at -"
tone and a vent flag.
"roger. stars 25 and 42; angle difference 5 balls; (columbia noun 93, plus 00165, plus 00186, minus 00039, time of torquing 121 15. over."
"yeah, i put your antenna up."
yes. mercy_ yes.
that going down to pdi?
roger. you'll be crossing 45 west at 77 04 l0 or _bout 40 seconds from now. over. thirty seconds from now.
"america, houston. we'd like narrow beam width."
oke_. 102.0.
okay. 07 0h 07 5h cc at 177:19 -
"casper, houston. we'd like for you to run another gimbal drive check in the yaw axis on both scs and g&n, and let us take a look at it."
get some more.
okay. i'm going to go to reset again; will that be all right?
"a friend of mine says ""wow woozle!"""
okay.
okay. i'm in ags pulse right now. it's the ...
... all through down there? o4 oo 22 35 (clanking)
"and by the way, houston, our eva antenna did (tranq) retract."
sure.
yes.
"houston, 11. are you still getting high bit rate off the omni's at this distance?"
"mark at 1 minute, dave."
"that's right. that's where it's setting high. i knew i'd forget that. okay. now, let me get this thing out. okay. okay. let's press. better get latched."
okay. stand by.
e'verything looks great down here. cdr-i2_ - - direct. lmp-i=m i'm not going to be able to squelch him out e_y more.
"ron, we're going to lose you in about i minute, and you're looking great. no problems at all."
"okay, i've got the f/8 and f/il. i'll do the 5.6 one."
"houston, in crossing crisium and marginis, it looked fairly clear that with the small fresh craters, and i don't have a good size estimate right now - i think i'm looking in terms of 100 or 2 meters. you can distinguish where blocks have been thrown up by them, or not - possibly giving depth of the local regolith from the pictures you'll get in there."
"come on, baby, open. ponna, it goes."
loud and clear.
"yes, sir."
okay.
"mark it; 7 minutes. roger; go; 104 down and 28,000; still about a thousand high, it looks like. _ ·_,_ _ _*_s:¸ ,_ _ _ _ 04 08 2k 37 cdr ... look pretty good? 04 08 24 b8 lmp yeah; 22b *** ready; the ags ready at 14k. then i do a b60 and then turn the camera on. breaker's in. throttle down."
no one thinks like me.
"and, 15, if you'll give us accept, we'll up-link a refsmmat for desired orientation ptc."
that's affirm.
i can't even see the bottom where - right where we are.
"okay, 15. if you will turn off your squelch it will help, because we may occasionally have periods in - when coremis rather weak. and, otherwise, go ahead. ---"
okay ....
"and, dave, the lrv tools should come down with that strap. - 05 00 13 14 cdr-eva yes. i got it."
"okay, very good. yes, i think that the - at least, it's a going bet around here that we're sampling the subfloor when we're sampling - at least the top of the subfloor when we're sampling the intermediate gabbro there. the rocks and the boulders."
"we need to get that stuff on the mantle, too. i mean on the blocks."
"(laughter) yeah, i think that one was longest."
"charlie, ... me in again."
you can try. be careful.
"and our water separator apparently isn't (eagle) working too well. we're getting a lot of water through the suit loop, and we've changed water separators, but it doesn't seem to have improved the situation any."
"safety's in, safety's in. that safety's in and that safety's in. okay, they look good."
"okay. going to get the contingency sample there, nail. *** three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases. (goss net 1) tape 70/26"
"okay. next, page 26, circuit breakers."
"oh, i see that. is that all you have to do? you don't have to - while we're in a - -"
"roger. are you behind it in the orbit, or are you just - is it just sitting there in front of you as you look at it?"
"okay, bob, this is gene. i had a - just a quick view of the site, and if we're anywhere near it, we'll recognize it, i think, without question. and, i think with that, we'll bid farewell and good night."
what's that?
"jim, are you deploying the side now?"
mark.
yours come down faster than mine?
"probably in this - probably all this stuff flying this around, maybe."
- - magazine romeo romeo.
and it's all right.
move it up a little.
"yes, we got to - we got to keep from dropping everything. i'll tell you, the big lesson today - -"
"well, you know john and charlie can tell you just had bad it is. i wouldn't have believed it - i guess i didn't believe it, or ! would have worked a little harder to make sure that fender was going to stay on. but it - man, just that short -trip back from where we lost it, snd we were just covered. the whole - i couldn't even read the parts of the panel on the rover, plus all the battery covers and everything."
"okay, vance."
"yes, but that's off over there on the ground now, somewhere or another."
- - we'd like you to open circuit fuel cell 3.
it's down to your right.
"well, let's give it a go. okay, tony. while we were gone, we got a caution flag."
okay. get a pass. (eagle ) 05 04 49 26 _ got it? ... (eagle )
that's okay. that's good.
"okay. i think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97, and we could walk you through it, and that way i could probably get the story straight. over."
"yes. 06 20 30 34 i24p-eva okay. 'i'al_£,q_6/32 i'agc 1044"
... out there.
- - f/ll now.
you guys are getting easy.
"okay. go ahead. 05 12 14849 cc at e mi - ei minus 02:30, during power removal from the umbilical, f_rst thing we do is two steps with the csm. we open the main b, the lm power to main b circuit breakers, and then there's a third step which says ""circuit breaker eps sensor signal, main b_ open."" just delete that step. over."
okay.
"watch it, watch it, watch it."
"boy, that straight wall really shows up from here. just so they know that's a pretty interesting thing. it's interesting enough to rate number 36. 05 08 13 k5 cc okay. and i guess you're rocking on, ready for your terminator photos here of guericke. 05 08 lb 52 cmp yes. i'm sitting waiting to get a little closer to them. i got lassell, albategnius b all lined up and boresighted. tape'84/25 ·page 917 05 08 l_ 02 cc golly."
...
let me get your rock bag before you get away.
let me get you - let me get you out of the sun.
that sounds good.
"okay, that - that tvc s_vo powers number i gets power ... o0 02 bi 49 lmp that's right."
"okay. okay. yes, will do. yes."
"356, yeah. (laughter) 356 - - 03 22 16 58 _ no, it's 355.43."
okay 90.
"it'd be better. you'd get shadows and - and then the shadow of the lm when it comes down, in case this landing radar does its thing again."
"we have you - stand by, buzz. roughly about 50 000. stand by."
"roger. apollo lb aii_-to-gi_oundvoici,_ti<anzcri?pion taf_e 33/i [_ ,u .l)/j"
"and, charlie, when you're taking that pan, let me know. i have another picture for you. 05 23 05 45 i/mp-eva ail righty."
okay. say again the longitude.
okay.
"tranquility, houston - -"
"the clock is running. pan camera self test to on (up). talkback barber pole, to five frames, and then gray."
right now.
"okay. that was a projection of fecum.ditatis mare_ i guess_ up in%o there. scuiptt.red hills vend to have both a regional distribu%ion and a structurally controlled distribution, the struc- turally - structural control being apparently re- lated to the rims of - of old craters. for example, there are some sculptured-hills-appearing topo- graphic materials that - again, in the ray-excluded zone, but out in fecunditatis - we find the rim of a fairly large flooded crater - in fecunditatis. and all of this may tie in with the possible - possibility that we saw at the la_lding site, that sculptured hills are composed of _m igneous gab- broic rock. and these may represent local intru- sions controlled by the structure of an old impact crater - extrusions controlled by the structure of the old impact crater."
the only other thing that bothers me is that engine command in thrust. that is the one - doesn't it usually keep reading 10 percent all the time in the simulator?
verify ecs caution and h20 sep component lights on.
and i'm ready for your step.
yes.
"okay, i'll set them at a yaw of 45."
... up here.
you don't want them?
"charlie, put that in my bag."
"_nd, orion, would you give us voice, normal, and hi bit rate, please?"
okay.
".... that's never going to stay there, dick."
"okay, the things that will set the tvc enable are the spacecraft control switch to cmc, the optic zero to off, the optics mode to manual, and the cmc tvc gimbal test in p40. these things occur only if i'm in p20 options 0, 1, 3, 4; p22, p23, p24, p52; and a verb 41 noun 91."
"okay. that sounds good. our first one, we noted a very small load change on battery bus a yester- day, several minutes prior to your sp$ burn, and we're trying to - to chase down what may have caused this. we suspect that you may have - have closed two circuit breakers that should have been closed and just are curious to know if you did close them, or if when you looked to verify them, they were already closed. and, the circuit breakers in question are the sps pitch 1 and yaw1 circuit breakers that feed bat a. f"
"by the way, the troops are getting into the lm right now."
"houston, this is antares. how do you read? ok 16 37 49 _ houston, antares. over."
get that?
okay.
say again.
good deal.
"yes, i -"
"is that enough different positions, or you want more, charlie?"
it's between sherlock and camelot - between -
"i know you told me that, but i didn't see any stars out there. l0 g1 18 00 cdr there you go. cmc. spica."
"well, but this - -"
"roger. back to block. 02 03 16 30 c_ apollo 11, this is houston. we woudd like to terminate the charge on battery b at get of 51 30. over."
there's the canopus seeker.
"and, falcon, this is houston. we will not up-link a state vector to you; your pgns and ags are both good. *** independent."
"john, when you get to the noun 66 and 67 values, we want you to read us the tapemeter values of h and h-dot. 04 01 05 50 imp it's right on. it was the - -"
"is the worst. yeah. can you put your arm over your helmet? there we go. okay. let's - let me spend some time here. okay. that's probably about as good as we're gonna do, john."
no. enter. enter. o0 02 o0 59 cml° why?
"... for some things that you guys threw in there as per usual. 09 04 55 18 _ you want me to close instruments in ... equipment, too?"
"okay, al, thank you very much. some time during this pass, we are going to be requesting an isa weight which you have in your lunar surface check- list, page 3-2. and we'll have a map camera and a pan camera pad to send up to you."
that's affirmative.
okay - -
now for the fun in back (laughter).
"now, if you could stand up straight - just for a second."
okay. i'm going to leave the - optimistically leave the walking traverse maps in the cabin.
little fat ball.
"yeah, a little bit - -"
okay. cml° okay.
"hey, we're glad to hear that."
"stand by, ken. we're getting a checkpoint here."
go ahead.
"roger. i see something coming off of the lunar module now that i - i haven't been up here looking out the window. i j_ustnotlced - it's - it's - it looks like it's coming out of a vent or something. and from looking at it through the window, it is beneath this sheet that's sort of shredded off, and it's right between the - that spiral antenna and above the big aps tank. but this is definitely coming out in a stream right now, looks like, and not very many particles, but they're just being propelled away from the lunar module at some velocity."
"okay, now. okay, monitor cuff gage; verify pcv closes. monitor pressure decay for i minute; verify less than 0.8."
"it's pretty much the same with the eyeballs in here, and it looks a little bigger now. but the only way i could see it very good at all was with the monocular, a little while ago."
(yelling) yes.
"hey, dick? contingency samples."
"verified; reading 94. 06 18 52 12 cdr-ijm okay, you're 5 square to me; check with houston."
what is this one?
"okay. understand 95:56. and looking over the flight plan, it looks like, had we gone on the original doi trim, we had about 40 minutes of sim data there. maybe we can just scratch that."
roger. 04 09 37 xx begin lunar rev ll
"okay, charlie. we think you're about to run out of primary feedwater; stand by for the tone. just press on there."
"yeah, it's - you won't believe what it is."
"i'll get them. loud and clear, houston. the burn was good."
"you - you can see a lot of them right on the hori- zon. okay. we probably want to - when you can, dave, swing around to the west; we're going a little too far south here."
can't miss it.
"endeavour, auto on high gain, please. 08 05 03 08 _ roger. auto."
roger. i got it.
off.
okay. £ still have my ball powered up and i'm coming around past 270 right now. i've got a slight roll and pitch offset in there. my pitch needle about halfway up and my roll needle is about 4 degrees over now.
roger. understand.
and i've got a tei-49 pad any time you want it.
you got yours in?
"ail right, it's on. okay. okay, you can shut it off. i've got almost 60 percent."
"at least he didn't forget this one. ron, we've got some data here for you."
i'm in.
"you all set, or do you want me to wait a minute?"
24:30.
"okay, jack, that was a problem here on the ground. over."
okay. thank you.
was the signal reverberating that long?
"well, i'll tell you what. we ended up with the - the same trouble. let me - let me run through and tell you what did. let me get the flight plan out here. time skip"
okay. 06 23 29 23 imp-eva watch the tv cable.
"apollo 11, this is houston at 1 minute. tra- jectory and guidance look good, and t?e stage is good. over. o0 02 45 23 cdl apollo 11. roger."
... don't make it move because we're still flying. 00 02 37 h3 cmp here we go.
"yeah, we're - then we're 2 minutes ahead on that. we caught up, babe."
"okay. while i'm getting the next one, maybe you can - ... away the box a little bit."
"yes, i know it's clean. let's forget it."
"a-3, c-4, b-3. a-3. c-4 - okay, ron. a-3, c-4, b-3, d-4."
"see what i'm trying to do? i've got to pitch over now, right?"
okay. do you have any equipment listed? i']] just get it and give it to him and i can just sit here where i am.
"roger. we've been having a little bit, thunderstorm-type, the last couple of days. we had a pretty good rain today, smd it's been overcast. a slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple c_' days, and primarily evening and a_ernoon th_idershowers."
"okay. keep it up, there; you got 120 now. dr. berry would like to keep it there for a while."
"okay. ""cm 3"" is ... to ""cm 4."""
"they are under my seat, joe."
okay.
"and, bob, the cdr's going off the loop right now. i'll be back in plenty of time for that maneuver."
"that's affirmative. and at 71:20, we want to enter, ""load dap with the weights and gimbal trim from msfn, and call emi° 509."""
"yes, i can do that, but i think the pictures will be better, vance, because the cinder cones are much smaller than the definition in the picture. i i"
i don't believe that.
"okay. s-band anteena is open, ags, there's fdai, ac bus volt, a0t lamp, and - all closed except the thrust breaker. okay, urine line heater breaker should be open. rendezvous radar - signal condi- tioner 1, aea, abort stage, atca (pgns), aeld, direct control, deca power, logic power, utility. okay. signal strength display; the three of those should all be closed. they are. two, 3, 4, those are open. one, 2, 3, 4 of those are open. one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of those is open. one of those is open. one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. seven of those is open. excuse me, chartie."
"oh, hard to tell."
doesn't show up that way today.
okay. now if you'll close the gate.
i've done that.
"i'm going to order pork and scalloped potatoes; i don't whether you do or not, but i am."
_'ist the handle.
"okay. would you like for me to just read you all the questions, and let you mull those over before you work on it, or you want to do one at a time?"
"there you go. 08 00 ll lb cmp i need to defecate. key, i was gonna suggest, if you guys need to take one, you ought to do it before we get rid of the lm. 08 00 ll l? lmp i agree. let me get over here."
"okay, we is behind the moon."
okay.
but it's no problem; we can put it anyplace you like.
"okay, open she ullage, two, circuit breakers. 01 06 37 46 c._.gp they're oeen."
"okay; fine. 06 01 04 31 iaip-eva and this is going to be sporty. see that string of - excuse me, john - see that string of second- aries in - in stubby?"
"okay. 06 02 51 41 hmp-eva we could give it a little test drive, john, if -"
"yes, sir."

roger on that.
okay; that was the problem. we've got it.
"that okay, jim?"
i think ...

"15, the word here is to proceed; give your photog- raphy first priority there, and maybe we can see the - the moon out of the other window."
"well, i love it, and i'm sure it did a good job - -"
see it? o0 03'23 21 lmp yes.
"yes, we can get it out of the purse."
"and houston, eagle. are you going to use the high gain before you can look at our gda posi- tion indicator?"
... 2000 feet won't give you the velocity to get away the moon and back to earth orbit ... 07 04 17 58 cdr no - -
"okay, logic power ... 181 ... deploy/retract. that's done. 08 04 03 03 imp ..."
"houston, are you monitoring our p52 technique?"
"okay. yes, we are at 45 degrees, bob. let me check it. i'll lose the comm on you a second. i've got to turn it towards me."
"okay, bob, that's adjusted plus 15 and 190, and i suspect i was a little closer to 15 than 20 when i called you before."
"okay. and so we'd like to go on to station 7, · then, when you get the 500 and the core, in hopes i of finding a variation of boulders along the front. _i"
maybe you ought to put yours down there. save a little time.
"yes, i can't quite reach that. ·00 00 41 51 cdr okay."

"orion, go lo bit rate."
"beautiful. okay, we're going to have to move that thing - that line, jack. you ready? tape77a/42"
i'm giving you readings.
"yes. if it's too loose, we can pull the snap and tighten her up."
okay.
"okay, it's going closed."
"roger, jack. and we're reading you slightly garbled but loud."
here ... 03 04 24 24 cml° okay. that's what we need to know.
"oh, okay."
okay. let's go.
what are you going to get out of here?
"yes. saw a flash, but i didn't hear it. gosh, i used to hear them all the time. huh!"
"okay, jim. let's get on with - seeing what's here - here at the front. 05 23 58 12 i24p-eva i'm with you."
"okay, bob. we seem to be holding delta-p at about 0.2. i suspect that's probably zero."
"roger, doctor."
"no, you don't, ken - -"
go ahead. i'm writing.
"okay. go ahead, vance."
"okay, the ... is there; l0 seconds to ... 05 01 27 _6 cmp four, 3, 2, i-"

"endeavour, this is houston with a final update con- cerning the trusty lcru on the lunar surface. we turned it on yesterday, and it worked beautifully for about 13 minutes. we w - we were panning around, zooming in and out, got a few more good pictures of the - the surrounding mountains, and suddenly we lost the tm down-link. in fact, we lost everything in a very short time, about 1/60th of a second, almost as though someone had turned it off. we tried - we waited awhile and tried to reactivate it, and did such things as send signals back to it to pan around, while we looked carefully on the passive seismometer for evidence of motion. apparently it was not responding to the signals. the temperatures were completely normal right before it went off the air. we're not exactly sure what happened. over."
"and write small. ""p20, option 2. noun 78, plus 270.00, minus 040.63."""

"yes, you've got to walk - you got to walk back to the lm anyway - i got to - we got to - -"
"yeah, don, what i was gonna say is that the - the peapacks [?] on the shaft are within - yeah - the readability of the dsky. the trunnion then seems to be off by about 2/100, which i think is a pretty fine agreement. and for the interest of some of those people who are talking about these optics and whether they drift or not, if you can watch 1691 right now, you'll find that i'm in - the mode is manual and i'm in direct, and you can watch them drift slowly. and at low rate, i'll go to resolve, and they drift at approximately the same rate. there seemed to be some question about that earlier. i thought - some of the guys in the back might be interested in that."

"yes, i was going to say there's no sense in trying to get them up the massif; i don't think you'll see anything up there."
sure would like to have that little hasselblad. that's a nice camera. had a real one that you could keep as your own. i like that electric feature.
roger. guess it's summertime down there.

i haven't got it yet; we're working on it.
"program alarm was resetable, as you probably noticed."
"oh, i think that is probably a good discussion for the debriefing after the flight."
okay.
here it is.

"okay. you can unzap that water, if you'd like. and let's go off vox. let's go on ptt."
"well, i think - there's sort of a - the rear end breaks out at about 10 to 12 clicks."
"okay, deploy main a, main b are both off, center."
"- this rock in this bag, if we put it this way?"
"yes, it has that appearance all right. hey, gene. do you see that rock - -"
"well, why don't you take it about lo feet and go - well, put it on infinity for the time being. we might - -"
i know we're next to that band but i know where we're going. my next is 094/5.1 is what i want for that sample.
"if we want to - if we get out of this dumb egress mode, we're not going to - certainly the cabin isn't going to fail, now. we've been in and out - let's get. i'm in cabin right now."

houston. cabin fan is coming on.
"roger. well, i'm happy too. you know, it took a while to find a technique i was - initially, i got up to 90 with just isometrics - pushing against the couch, and the running is obviously what it takes."
"okay. okay, ..i what there was about that delta-p? we haven't made such an issue of the dleta-p before. 01 06 36 56 _ see that? we said fuel and ox greater than the delta-p - greater than 35, ox greater than fuel. that's what we got right now. man, i thought i burned them all."
okay. in work.
"that might be earthlight up ahead, dave."
"america, houston. we'd like you to go ahead and get on the high gain again since - and stop it just wandering around aimlessly. and how does the earth look now?"
"beautiful. okay, we're at - we're at 2, and we're monitoring it for 3 minutes."
let me look - let me see that hatch once more.

"houston, america."
"okay. on that docking latch number 10, depress the yellow auxiliary release button, noting that the button will depress and whether it stays snapped in after being depressed. now, the in- terest here is if the button will not depress, the latch mechanism is either stuck or broken. if the button stays snapped in, this indicates - or probably indicates that the latch was only partially cocked at launch - -"

okay ... 04 22 20 25 _ drop it in my bag.

they'll die.
"okay; well, we can use the shovel if - where - where do you want to go?"
"okay, go ahead."
couple of more pounds and we'll be there.
"okay, if you're in position to take pictures of the lm, we wanted the lm to do a 360-degree yaw, and you're to take pictures of the - the minus-b por- tion of the ascent stage, using the same camera settings that you have on the - the dac and the el, except for focus on the el should be changed to infinity. over."

"well, i hope not, joe. but we're sure in a fine place here. we can see st. george; it looks like it's right over a little rise. i'm sure it's much farther than that. we can see bennett hill. we see something off at our - like - i o'clock that's a pretty good elevation we're not too sure of that --but we'll give you some more dedail - detail later on."
"roger. it's a spectacular view as we glide across the sea of serenity, and i'm taking a picture now of a sinuous rille out to the north."
some little rocks in here - -
"ohs you bet you. yes, i know that. no, i was just touching the top of the hook when i pulled it back off the docking ring. i'm pulling back onto the docking ring, and it looks like it's back in the cocked position now."
"roger. 02 12 58 14 ii_p wetve - okay, we've also completed, i guess in essence, all of page 8."
yes. i need to -

- - hardware here. we wonder where scb-2 went?
"and it looks like it will be about l0 minutes, i guess."
"okay, 7-9 lgc/imu power up, chan_e that time from 183:04 to 184:10. the eat seriod time is now 184:20. turn the page, and the 183:59 above ""park rendezvous radar"" is now 135:05. next page, don suits at 185:15. go to the next page. prep for equipment jettison is 1,35:50, and the same page - helmet/glove donning is 185:58. next page, pressure integrity check, [[86:04. cabin depress is 186:08, and hatch opening is 186:12. next page, 14, cabin repress is [[86:15. cabin cleanup for launch is 186:20. _ld on the follow- ing page, we're going to delete -;he p22 but we'd like you to go all the procedures except those from ""verb 95 enter,"" through ""po0 enter,"" inclusive - the center section of procedures. £;o you'll still be closing the rendezvous radar breakers, going to ix)c, and park:lng the _ltenna and copying pad. over."
that's affirmative.
"okay, jack. one more question about odyssey here."
"okay. 03 14 08 09 imp helium pressure is a little lower than i expected to see it at this point. let's say that's 1500 pounds. 03 ih 08 15 lm2 that's - that's about right. it's about 1000 dur- ing rendezvous, looking at the pdi."
"that's all right. i do that all the time. usually, i ihavemy thumb in the way."
i guess that's what happens when you cut a lot out of a checklist.
"okay. cb i_mpower-2, main b, open; cb lm power-l, main a, open; cb eps sensor signal, main b, open. stand by 1, jack."
that's affirm.
that's on a magazine. that's on our camera.
"and after littrow rille, you should be coming up on le monnier. do you have much chance of seeing down at that angle?"
how come?
"orion, this is houston. will you give us another range and range rate, john?"
- - ... the lower 5?
"hey, jim, is the waste water stopped?"
"okay. delta-v thrust verified off. pilot valves verified open, and we'll close the group 5."
"and it's level, believe it or not."
"okay, that's in work."
"hey, you were right. greatest thrill of my whole life. really big - really a thrill, really great."

roger. would you tel eagle his y-dot is minus (columbia) 1.0. over.
"man, if we had landed anywhere but where we did, we might have been in serious trouble. i can't get over it. i'd have hated to work on any of those slopes."

"okay, you want it now?"
"... oh, i ..."
"apollo 15, houston. if one of you guys is free, we've got some updates we could read to you."

"okay, dave. do you want to swing over and get the sm rcs monitoring check? or do you want me to get that ?"
"dave, we want you to head toward station 4, and we'll advise you on - what your rate looks like and the task that we want you to carry out once you arrive. just start off in the direction of station 4, please. 06 02 15 47 ia_p-eva okay; give me a heading. i can see it over there, dave."

okay.
"what a ride! what a ride! ok_; 18 seconds, john; 30 seconds, looking for 308."

"11, houston. we observe the ptc to be fairly well established here, and we'll keep you posted on how it's going, and your friendly vnite team commentator is taking over now."

"i don't know who's going to do it for you, ed. i c_'v get over there, and stu's going to be getting h_s suit on. you better - turn them off before you leave."

"yes, let me have that ... 05 22 47 21 im? okay."
"there would be an old saying that would apply to that, then, wouldn't there?"
and that's just for your information.
that's affirm.
"net ye_, no. 08 23 37 _1 cdr prchably too mmch light in here. why don't you flip your floods off and see if you can see a dark horizon."
"okay, endeavour; this is houston. and we're ready for the camera cycling procedure now."
"okay, the color is - -"
yes.
"hey, i think the one thing i neglected to mention is that we essentially have a convex surface from the - the material; in other words, con - convex with the high part in the middle; and, of course, that's where the bubbles are, too, but i think you'd generally have that type of a surface anyhow. and, it hasn't broken the meniscus of the lower, or the thinnest ring."
yes. this should be right where we park. 06 21 19 27 kmp-eva that would be a - be a good picture for houston.
"well, i guess i broke the injector into the next ..."
and then you want to ... off ...
no. that's all right.
"dave, that wrench is on the rack that's holding the tubes - right along beside you. sorry."
hold/fast. go on.

"houston, 16."
"lfow are you doing today, philip?"
oh - d_u!
"okay, self test."
okay.
i can even see mount marilyn from here.
this does. no--
"leave a space for a sample, i guess, gene."
"houston, apollo 11. is that p30 pad?"
"well, that was my impression. half an inch in - in general, but dave probably has another comment. 05 08 52 41 cdr-i_m no, joe, i'd say no more than a half an inch. it seems to ride very lightly; i think the - the bearing on the surface is - is very light, and the wire wheels seem to work very well. they've got good traction, and even though the rear end did break away several times, it was primarily because of the locked-up front wheels. and i was very pleased with the operation. i think the thing performs better than we'd expected."
"right. pump's on and i'm beginning to be sucked down. let's get the cabin to egress, okay?"
"yes, we lose 5 or 10 minutes going around here without comm, and it usually breaks up seemingly when somebody has something to say, either you or us."
"okay, from 262 plus 00 to 262:20, we're gonna schedule in some geology debriefing for eva-3 for john and charlie. 09 19 48 38 cml° okay; tony, i got that - it's written down."
"uh, hum, i see nothing on the v over h sensor. there 's no back - black paint missing. there 's nothing obscuring the field of view. the glass is not cracked. l0 02 16 lb cmp-eva the shield is not obstructing the field of view. there's nothing in the way, karl."
"eagle, houston. would you please have columbia put in command reset? over."
"chamber pressure was hanging in there around 100. the latter part,of the burn it started oscillat- ing a little bit and got down a little bit below 100."
okay?
"okay, one more than what you gave me at station 5, understand."
"for that time to take, you're going to have to reselect 715."
roger.
"by golly, it's right there. some things we do pretty well, i guess. this program has figured out how to find stars."
"verb 25, enter. plus 0014.2."
yeah.
"well, let's open her up a little more."
"okay. 04 21 24 54 l_p-eva okay, bob, the leam's deployed, aligned; and the level bubble is - just touching the inner ring."
"okay, and i'm ready to pressurize the sps, if that's what you want."
"pm1 to cb, joe."
(laughter) ...
i said thank you.
"thank you, sir."
okay.
"okay. spend 20 minutes adjusting the tv and then turn it off. going back out to the right, here."

"even the kids at camp got into the news when mike jr. was quoted as replying ""yeah"" when somebody asked him if his daddy was going to be in history. then after a short pause he asked, ""what is history?"" in washington, president nixon is planning to use his executive power to stream- line the interstate commerce commission. accord- ing to industry sources, it was reported nixon would trim the commission from ll to 7 members by not making new appointments."
good show. you feel like you got all three?
"- point i and the drogue? what, sir?"
"okay, i have the conveyor now. have the bag. and it's deployed. and standing by to deploy the mesa. and the mesa has released -mesa has released properly, houston."
okay. and - roger. copy thmt.
"jim, can you get an amp reading for us as you climb?"

"okay. vance, i tried that but when i start doing roll only i get pitch coupled in with it. but both of them rolling u_ toward this desired amount, though. i'm u_ to 46 and in pitch and 326 in roll."
roger. we hope so_ _oo.
"ok_f, tony. can you read me now? i'm on vox."
okay.
okay.
"oh. i'll do that. hey, charlie? oh, the ir was hiding it. that's why you couldn't see it. here. 07 22 34 57 _ ... see it."
"there we go. okay. now what? 03 23 33 04 i_mp okay, you can do the rendezvous radar self-test, if you want to. that's all we got to do."
what have you got in there now?
i didn't need it for the other.
yes. we went fixed on the - -

all right. why don't we do that?
"... 09 03 26 59 _ you've been out about 25 minutes now, ken."
you want my camera?
we're omni delta. we're reading you loud and clear. do you want us to stay here?
"well, let me turn around here."
the t-start time will be 164:35:00. t-stop will be 168:05:41.
"okay, cabin pressure to boost/entry."
"five ..., okay."
"okay. row are we fixed for samples? here's 5, and it's about 1/2 to 3/4 full."
"okay, charlie; you should have - charlie; you should have - -"
"man, can you throw things a long way up here."
yes. you should be just about over eratosthenes right now.
we should have turned that cabin fan off last night. it wouldn't have been so cool - been less noisy.
"yeah, i'd like to know that, too. 05 07 20 32 lmp-_ houston, 16."
"okay. i presume that what this means is looking to the south. it was cross-sun originally. i suspect that's what happened here, the way it was written up. so it's a 7-foot looking at the - all the switches to make sure you guys turned them the right way, i suppose. and then a 7-foot looking down-sun, so that would be facing west, that side of it."
stand by.
"roger, jim. and could you dust our lens - - 06 00 49 18 ia_p-eva want me to clean this - now?"
"okay, we'll take a look at the currents now."
"ah, is - is that - i've seen the same characteris- tics in south ray rocks as north ray rocks, being the black and the white. the streaks up the side of the craters are - are - are basically the same. but the - the north ray you'd - ycu got to guess at it a little bit more, and that might be totally what my guess is. it could be wrong, but - i think - i kinda think they're at least a similar rock. tape 110/_7"
"basically, we just want to see it move. you - you go up to the outer circle, that's - that's plenty. and again, you ..."
well - -
"and we're gonna stay at ptc right up to the mid- course 5. and if you're - can get to it now, ken, i'd like to get the image motion, on; and the m_pping camera, on. and, then give me barber pole plus 2."
"okay. configure - step 10, ""configure circuit breakers per activation pages 3 and 4."""
yeah.
"yes, it was not there. okay. cmp_ the spiced oat cereal, mixed fruit, instant breakfast_ and coffee, potato soup, and peach ambrosia. that's all for breakfast. and then later on, he had chocolate pudding and a grape drink. and let's see - we all - you might log him for a vitamin pill and me for a vitamin pillo"
"al, want me to close your tsb for you?"
"roger, we're ready to go."
roger. no sweat here; you got a minute _r so before we're in the l_uar sounder attitude for the marius hills there.

"well, i can't turn it."
"oh, i'll wear it tonight, bob."
"houston, canister number 4 is in bravo now."

"okay, america. how about going back to narrow on the antenna. and could you verify what you loaded on noun 3_? it went by so fast on the down-link, we didn't get it a chance to look at it."
"at what, 1/250th?"
"okay. and, gene, your bag is hanging by one hook there. be careful, if you can."
good show. everything looks fine up there from down here.

it's just a beautiful little valley.
"okay, don; one comment. i'll try again and take a look at the optics in the - when we get out into the double umbra, but right now in the telescope, i - i can see the stars now, but i still can't see star patterns. like we looked at - at _ntares_ and you just couldn't see the scorpion at all. and that may be due to the extreme amount of earthshine that's being reflected off of the lm. that lm is like looking at it almost in daylight, and, good gosh, the - the moon looks like you can see everything on there just like - it's really bright."
what? no more film.

okay.
"hey, get your high gain to working."
"and, houston, that last noun 49 looked like 60 and 16."

here we come!
"man, there are a lot of stars out here in one sector of the sky."
...
i think it's the battery temp. nub'let 2 is 135.
"okay. i'm going to up with the power amp here, vance."
roger. mark that.
okay.
"did you want me to do this at 123:05, on time? is that correct?"
roger.
- - i had three freaking little clips and - take those - -
what - what do you see on the monitor?
"... ought to come up the side. then, you got us in the right plane, ,ti_. we're in the right plane. we're pointed off and we'll swerve on again with the earth, moon, and sun. 03 09 h4 52 cdr in another respect, it might be easier to get a -"
"tvc servo power, number l, is ac1/main a."

em.
"that aps pressure? yeah, we can't do that, can we? oh, no, you stay for 3 days - -"
"alfredo, are you still reading me?"
okay. does that look lined up to you?
"this must be the volcanic gases, because it's looking right at stone mountain. is that what you want?"
"pick a spot here, okay. you really have to pick your way."
"roger. it surely was different, anyway."
"okay, charlie. stand by. we're gonna try some command."
"what's the problem, geno? it won't screw on?"
"okay, that's right, also."
lo bit rate.
thank you. we're still discussing the vector here.
"we have a good shot of you there, pete"
roger. terminate charge on bat a.
roger. thank you.
"okay, ken. we don't have anything else ...."
"okay, going normal on the pugs valve."
yeah.
"now, if you'll hand me - the contingency samples bag, and a little jobber-do, i'll put those in it."
"we had a chance to watch you get a0s that time. i know we got lots of pictures of it, but you're going to have to look at one more."
houston. roger. out. (goss net 1) tape 46/3
they're all in; 5 - -
i would have bombed it out; it's just - -
"say it again, jack. i (]idn't get it. oh 15 01 43 cmp okay. [',tandby. if we confsgure the csm for powering up the lm, we aren't going to cut it short on lm power requirements to get us back in the entry interface, are we?"
"okay, go ahead with the pad."
"okay, go ahead."
"i'll bring it back. okay. bob, i guess you're reading me through the lm, huh?"
copy that.
"okay, copy that ... we'll take it into account."
roger. *** (tranq)
- - plus 10556.
it's closed.
... you don't think we could bag her in?
"yes, the map's so dirty you can hardly - hardly see it. f"
"okay, pan camera self test going to heaters."
okay.
sec.
"intrepid, houston. your - -"
ail right.
have a pencil? let's see it - thank you.
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"hey - i haven't really talked to anyone in the other two families today. so i'm sure that every- thing is fine or we would have heard it, but i'll try to get a last-minute update on that before you hit the sack."
i'll check it again about one - let's see what we got here.
i don't think those ... are as good as we're using them in here. 0h 04 54 05 cdr yeah. i don't - i don't think they're quite as good. 04 04 5h 09 cmp it looks like i need to start reversing my in-plane direction.
- - any of that white soil. is that right?
"okay. and that's the - that's at 180:20. that's with the verb 49 there. the next one is at 181:35, which is on the next page, and it's going to be at verb 49, maneuver to lopc. what we're going to do here is two separate maneuvers. we're going to do a maneuver which is a roll, so that when you do the next one, you'll avoid the gimbal lock because of the direction that the cmc would normally maneuver you. so, this maneuver is going to be in two parts. the first one we're calling a verb 49 maneuver vo the gimbal lock avoidance attitude at 181:35. that attitude 081, 181, and 317. the high gain: pitch, minus 19; yaw, 227, and auto and narrow for aos."
"say - say, bob? cml° yes."
"16, houston. we show you 55 percent on the waste tank. i'll give you a call at 50."
yes.
(laughter) okay; number 2.
"okay. we seem to have the feeling that the rocks you were describing in the lm area were just some- how just a little bit different than what you were picking up either down south or up north_. i guess we'll get that all straight when the rocks get home. 09 21 28 36 i_mp tony, i think that's - that the breccias were dif- ferent. we've been - maybe i'm going way out on a limb when i say this, but you - we've been col- lecting little fragments that have been floating around the cockpit here and looking at them, and they're crystalline - crystalline fragments that - with little white powdery exterior on part of it, and it - chalky appearance. and to me, this is - was characteristic of the rocks - some of the rocks around the cayley, which - now i'm really leading to a tuff breccia - but the matrix being the ash with these crystalline frags, and the crystalline frags looked just like the rocks - the crystalline rocks around north ray. at least, the black ones - at least, the couple i found here floating around. now that's not to say that the fragments are - there are some fragments from whitish rocks, but they were a little bit dif - more difficult to see in this white matrix of what looks like tuff now, because it's very powdery."
"orion, this is houston. we'd like you to proceed now with this attitude mneuver, and i'll give you the fdai angles and the steerable angles."
at 273:01 we - -
"apollo 15, houston. 01 02 43 27 cml° go ahead, houston."
"that's right. i agree with you. hank, we'd like to - i'd like to run a p52 here and see - see what kind of torquing angles we get. that will tell us whether or not we really been having any kind of a - of a hangup in the a-to-d section. as short as it was, we couldn't have gotten very far off in attitude."
it bumps against this ... - -
"okay. so all the rest of that block up there, i delete, right?"
"okay. ail we have to ds is h_ng on h more minutes. 05 21 hl 34 cc antares, houston. a mark at iiminutes. '2+_:_nbdy. 05 21 41 39 of }i_rk. four minutes."
is it taking in?
"yes. yes, i'd just as soon go ahead and get the shit done."
"okay. master alarm just came on. okay. and the heaters, mesa, open. you can open your mesa heaters. we're getting a master ai_, houston. i don't know why."
"the m_t's going off to the right. 0_ 19 49 04 cdr the met's trying to find a smooth place to go. 02 19 49 09 l_ al, i think you'll have to go around this crater, here, to the left. i think we can find our way dorm. good heavens, that's a deep hole. but i guess we can get it - make it, either way."
"okay. they gave you a go, ken."
177:19.
pull hard.
roger. stay for ti.
"go ahead, karl."
"no, we're not that close. uh-uh. cochise is up at - see that rim where those blocks are? ijqp-eva no, that's a small crater."
"no, we haven't caught any, anomalies in the film usage."
"and, we'll talk to you a little bit about that when you get a chance. 06 06 33 53 i_p-i_ okay."
yep.
we're getting ready to go - do a p23. i - you trying to close it or open it?
...
"- - the tv camera's gotten so hot we've turned it off temporarily, here."
go ahead.
"okay, ken. gene just stowed the eva antenna."
"okay, go ahead. i'll be putting tttese hoses in the back, here. 05 i0 52 48 lmp okay. you track it, and then_ from those, you hook it up while you're at it. i'll hold it for you. go ahead. 05 10 53 02 cde okay. i think - that ought tc do it. 05 !0 53 26 _m_' ... 05 10 53 47 cdfi okay. 05 !0 53 57 _[p *** there. it went. can't do two things at once. 05 10 5_ 36 lmf get it locked? 05 10 54 38 cdf yes. 05 10 54 43 _4f sure? it didn't feel like it. okay."
okay.
"it's such a long burn, it isn't going to make much difference. go ahead, get normal. there you go."
stop.
"oh, okay. well, i got it down without the dirt."
i will.
"aqusrius, houston. over."
"okay, got it. r"
"okay. that's what we're doing here gordo. cmld 0kay, gordo, do you want the 02 heaters 1 and 2, off, and 3, auto? that's what you've got."
"wait - you got to get up, jim. you're leaning too _ far back. grab the handle low. that a boy. okay, now you can set down. you're in good shape."
i know it - most of them in here are breccias.
i guess we'll burn it.
"endeavour, we'd like a pro on the p20 now, please."
"okay, dave. stand by. i'll inquire."
"orion, you're go !it5."
you got a lookup?
"(laughter) well, you- -"
"..., 16. can i talk to somebody about chlorine injection?"
"okay, jack. we need another one of those voltage amps readouts and then maybe we will get off of your back for a little while."
...
"oh. wait a minute, pete. i'm sorry. god durn. we've got a maneuver now."
and i'm cycling the cryo fans.
"hey, that's a nice red particle out there."
"plss 02 off and - okay, cabin warning light on. verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5. ev - use purge valve to depress pga as req'd [sic]. 06 06 03 50 t_jmp-i_m mine's already depressed. 06 06 03 52 cdr-il4 okay, post-eva configuration, 15 minutes."
negative. i got you locked back on again reacq and narrow.
ail right. plenty of time. are you through?
okay.
"copy that. cdr-e_a that's the soil from on top the rock. and we're taking a piece of the rock itself, which looks pretty much like the other one, bob. it might be a little bit more vesicular."
"roger. understand. we will scratch the activities from 178:20 to 178:30. and, at 178:39, we'll scratch ""dac on"". how about the activity there at 178:317 we - guess we'll do that, huh?"
"okay, go ahead."
"okay. thank goodness, you said that - i was about to pick this thing up."
"let's go, babe."
"okay. endeavour, give us omni charlie, please."
reacq in there. okay.
"oh, okay. yes. if you can get over there, i can · get it."
yes.
huh!
"houston. over. houston, this is orion. over."
"command module rcs logic, on."
ok_f. this is al's 5mi3reading 3.75; oxygen is reading 71; i have no flags; i'm on min cooling; and i'm comfortable.
"okay, we're going now. oh 01 05 _6 cdr-_4 okay, it's up and left like it's supposed to be. 04 01 05 _9 cc okay, john, when you get to the noun 66 - -"
"okay. so we pro on the noun 88, and we end up with a flashing 5018; and you want an auto maneuver here rather than using the ttca, so we pro with guidance, pngs; mode control, auto. we've got a 1.4-degree deadband with a verb 62 will give us the needles to try to zero them in and, at that time i look through the aot and, if it's like apollo 11 sun check, all we've got to have is the sun somewhere in the - out there somewhere on the sun as it passes. is that correct?"
"man, this is some rugged country down there, isn't it?"
"okay. noun 20 will be plus 295.86, plus all zeros, plus 084.14."
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read?"
"copy that, jack. 0h 17 31 43 cdr-lm okay, bob, i'm going to get on the plss, now."
"i'm not sure what you mean by it ""had been on about 10 minutes before you started."" you mean the dump had started?"
"endeavour, houston. over,"
it's open.
ail right. i'll take one.
"okay, jack. understand you completed securing the battery charge. now if you are ready to copy, jack, i would like to give you the two changes that we have to the powerup for the cm procedure. over."
"oh, boy."
yes. jim?
"okay. go for landing. 04 08 27 19 l_-i_4 - - 42 lpd. okay, 3900 feet."
"15, houston. you back with us again? 02 22 31 31 _ roger. we've been here all along, bob."
"okay, fine. 07 00 45 50 l_4p-eva i'll - i'll start it when we get svarted, hut it's on 12."
"©ordy, we're in p00 and data and we're standing by for your up-link, and how long does that aot heater breaker have to be open? i pushed it in at 184:08."
"okay, talk - discussing the - the flow in crater waterm_-n, south of tsiolkovsky, i guess what i said before still applies. the - what looks like on a map is the channel between waterman and tsiolkovsky is, in fact, too high for anything to flow between the two. there's - there' s definitely some elevation there. however, looking at it this time, it's pretty plain that that channel - or gully, or whatever you call the breach in - in tsiolkovsky's wall there between waterman and tsiolkovsky is caused by a graben-like fault system. there are two faults that run through there, and they run almost north and south right towards the central peaks, diverging - the one - the one on the west side, is slightly - is angled slightly to the northwest, but the other one goes _ ......... _'_ai_ost. _rectly north. a_ _e .source qf:tke_lava flow in waterman appears to be high in the - in the wall of waterman, on the north edge, right where the fault zone crosses the - the rim of waterman. d6 01 31 30 cc roger, al. we copy."
- - your - your donning straps.
let me get these in. *** what my batteries are reading if i can.
i swear i didn't steal it.
okay.
"okay, sir."
"roger. and that puts it in the light side? over. 06 07 38 18 _ roger. yes, it was in the light side. the earth was about - a two-thirds lit earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. and now coming from the opposite limb of the earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one-quarter to one-third of a radius in from the limb. generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. over."
get all that in ... in the overhead right now.... check the - -
how high up are we? do you happen to know?
"imu, power."
i loved that first ... - -
"go ahead. ready to copy. tape73a/a i_4p-lm the lm: plus 301.09, plus 284.53, plus 359.48; the csm: plus three zeros 35, plus 104.67, plus 000.52; the time: 110:24:00. over."
"hey, john. would you put my dac ... for me, please?"
"hello, houston. how do you read?"
"okay. we're getting set up for another gimbal drive check, ken, and what we want to do is go through a complete gimbal drive check by the num- bers, and have you tell us as you do each thing sa_despecially in relation to the - the yaw thumb- wheel, which way you're moving it and how many degrees and - and what's happening. and we '11 give you the word when we're ready to start that. we've got to get some things configured down here."
"okay, copy that. do we ever see a rover flag come up when you've got high temperatures there on the battery - have you seen the flag up yet?"
"oh, no. it's on the central station."
"got the hmmmer, charlie? good, i knew it, bring it here."
"columbia, houston. we've lost them on the high gain again. would you please - we recommend they yaw right l0 degrees and reacquire."
okay.
"okay. oops, i'm not ready. that says f4b on that; that 's an airplane."
do we have an 02 and h2 purge or just 02?
yes.
why don't we start getting the lights down in here?
... again. 03 13 45 34 i_ okay. looks like we're there.
"ron, ron, how's the hatch? get down on the hatch. your ops isn't fitting through the top. pull your- self down. straight forward. face down. nose down. now back."
"well, i don't know that i want to - drop it. i can hold on. we're not going to go that fast here."
"well, the central peak material is - you know, it's more smooth-type stuff. this stuff in the crater walls is - fine, straight sloping, except where it is slumped down. where it's slumped down, it's just kind of piled up - a jumble of - type stuff, you know?"
"okay, i got - i think they can locate us if we work that block field right there."
"if you'll tell me what's there, i'll continue. if one or maybe two sections, however many you think you can put on and still drill. once you get the sections on, we want you to use the drill again. and first, recycle the check several /_ times, as - as you used to do in the simulation, and then start the drill, and put only a few pounds of force on top of the drill. and, while _-_ it's running, if you notice from the torques that it starts to seize up, we want you to try to pull it back out of the hole a bit to free it, as you drill. over."
"seems so to me. our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. over."
"now, wait a minute, wait a minute."
"okay, charlie. we got that."
"wait a minute. why don't you hold off for awhile, jim?"
"i got one that's better for him this time, though. i'm not at all sure that those swirls that i saw north of - northwest of king are - are really - like the others or not. i - i tried to get a look at ibn yunus this time, and it's still a little too far to the north. 05 05 55 19 6mp you know, henry, one of the things that impresses me is that when you look at the mare surface in very high sun, like i'm doing now, a lot of the very shallow craters that have just very subtle, sweeping walls and are together maybe in a chain or in groups - when you see this at high sun, it looks exactly like a swirl pattern. if you didn't know that's what it was, you'd - you probably would wonder about it also."
"no, that's all right, vance. before we have to worry about that i guess we got another primary and three secondaries to go through."
"roger, ed."
"008:00; delta-v t is 79_8, minus 165, 022:06. go ahead."
"okay, houston, how do you read me on a?"
"okay. all right, the next thing we'll do is i'll give you a call when to hit the satellite launch switch. and we - we're about a minute and a half from the launch. and the satellite launch switch is one - is one that you put up and hold. i think it's a three-position guy."
roger.
that's a - -
"casper, houston. we're showing a difference here between your actual cdus and your final cdus."
okay. i need the pallet.
- - any good there.
"well, we'll get the padded bags later."
we can. that'll just be a 1-minute - a 1-minute burst.
"can you see it tumbling. does it have a shape, or is it a point?"
"go ahead, houston."
"hey, houston. i'm looking north up toward aristarchu$ now, and i can't really tell at that dist.ance whether i am really looking at aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more iltuininated than the surrounding area. it just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. a crater can be seen, and the _rea around the crater is quite bright."
you could dock on that son of a bitch at night with no strain.
"okay; let's get your ops hose. *** hose. ops hose. *** down here. that's your water hose. here's your 0ps hose. now, let's get the dust cover on it. *** in. i verified it's locked, and the lock - lock is in. cover is up, and we'll take another look at them. okay. okay; we got the master alarms."
okay. fine; thank you.
"yes, but that's on the - yes, that's on the side away from me. i'm on the lmps side and that's on the other side."
"roger, ron."
now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -
yeah.
no. dark.
"apollo 15, apollo 15; houston. over."
"that a boy, now. see? they get it all. okay, houston, talk to us. we're all here. except how does it - -"
okay; thank you.
0004?
"... let you lean on me. i_p-eva no, i got it. ,.:6 19 1_ 50 cdr-eva 670, 109, 801; 670, 109, 801."
there's a pineapple-orange.
"okay, bob, i guess i'm going to go pound away ands jack, i'm going to hit the gravimeter."
yes.
"okay. joe, i never did any systems reset, but it - they were all sitting zero when i stopped here."
yeah .... - -
main bus ties coming off.
"we copy you, ken."
great scenery_ isn't it?
"okay, ron - -"
"minus 0.33. verify mtvc, both sides. do you have them? {}kay. 03 09 52 02 67_p no ?,ffvc."
"let's go down and take a look at this little crater right here. there's a little small crater, i guess you can see, joe, at about 2 o'clock to the tv now. and - - 06 o0 18 l0 i_mp-eva there you go. having trouble getting up with it."
"okay, we hope that's fairly obvious."
"oh, we don't care. do whatever you want there. water's fine."
"roger. copy, eagle. out."
and your water.
"okay, bob, according to n_ inventory i'm going to return to the lm, and the camera is going to etb. we are done with the tge."
abort stage; engine arm to ascent. 99 pro. 07 03 37 25 cdr-i_i good lift-off. automatic. yaw left. pitch over.
"yes, sir. the temperatures on the batteries are 96 and ll0."
"okay. and one other question, charlie. i'd like to know if the note you gave me about damping the rates is before the other information on page 29."
"that's correct, sir."
"yeah, i'll close up the hatch for you. i can't believe the difference in 280 and 284 means a hill of beans - in this big marshmallow."
"bob, i can assume that from what you said there will be - probably not be a midcourse l?"
got a bag out?
really?
okay. and - the corollary - -
thank you. i forgot to tell you about it.
okay. very good.
you may want to get up here - -
"okay. we're in att hold. 03 23 3i 55 cmp how about if we set up this comm configuration to record data, and then i can work on the hatch."
i'm going up to max here for just a minute or 2.
"okay, my csi-cdh looks like minus 7.9 and minus 8.3."
"roger, jack. and i'd like to correct one call on my - the tei pads. there is one other difference between the tei-19 and the tei-12 on their notes. and the tei-19 assumes a circ burn. over."
"that - that was my problem with the rtg package, i -"
"well, we thought about going on up there; although - we're in a pretty good area here, too, from the standpoint of boulders."
okay.
"... no, it ran out. it didn't - i got the com- plete cooldown part of the ex - of the experiment on hi{and then switched to high. and i got about 2 minutes of high before the film ran out again. had that at high power on the - on the - -"
what?
"me, too."
and they are coming down.
"yes. that's where it's going. l_,_-eva well, bob_ it looks like - it survived. there is a - as i stand behind the panels - the left-hand panel may be tilted at about - well, less than 5 degrees_ probably about 2 or 3, but that's all. looks pretty good right now."
he's right. he's absolutely right.
apollo 11. roger. we got all that.
"okay, i have it."
"i'll tell you what, why don't you get a photograph of it right now?"
roger. (eagle)
...
"roger. copy. and, ken, i'd like to verify - is yonu- nonessential bus on main a or main b?"
"and you're right, jim. we've got another primary cartridge back there behind the ascent engine cover."
"vance, did you say for me to hold on the right yaw or do you want me to start it now? 03 0g 37 04 cc no, no need to hesitat,_, you can start now."
"pete, are we supposed to?"
"endeavour, this is houston. the rover boys have finished their tasks - most of their tasks with the aslep, and they are just now beginning ingress _ into the lm. dave managed to get the core drill f completely in; and, although he hasn't pulled it out yet, he'll pull it out on the next eva. the time to set the mission timer or to set your count- down for the zodiacal light photos is going to be about in 1 minute. and the word down here is that all of your systems are go; everything is looking super."
should the radar standby breaker be in or out?
just a reminder on the food reports if you want to shorten them. it's normally used negative report- ing - only those things you don't eat on the menu.
"yeah, ken. we'd like you to reverse it again."
okay. we'd like to see that.
"okay, geno. as long as you're drilling behind the rocks from the rtg, that's great."
"let me know when you get up there because i've got to turn my 02 off. well, i guess i can see it from here."
"and a1 bean was - that's right, that's the way i got to play it right now. i'll tell them i took the decongestant, but i ain't got a cold, like - (sneeze) nothing, let them figure that."

"the view of the moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. it fills about three-quarters of the hatch window, and of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in earthshine. it's a view worth the price of the trip.

okay. will do.
"houston, this is apollo 15. over."
okay. we're now right in the middle of the boulder field on the west rim. we haven't qui%e reached the rim yet.
... in the crater maraldi.
"... you do not want p40. okay, here we go. i got - the circuit breakers are all checked over on panel 8. the only ones that are out are rcs logic, the probe, and the stuff on the bottom rows that don't matter. okay. the switches for scs are in limit cycle, off; dead band, min; rate, low. i've got the rotation power at ac. direct are off. i've got my bmags. i'm going to ungage them now. they're ungaged. i!m going to scs control. okay. now i'm going over and catch the - the bus ties. here comes bus tie, a/c. it's on. e/c is on. gimbal power number 1 to ac 1, number 2 to ac 2. start pitch gimbal number 1. 04 02 56 14 cml° mark. and yaw gimbal number 1. 04 02 56 19 cml° mark. i have a thumbwheel drive. i'm driving it from zero to minus one-half to plus one-half, which is the trim. the yaw thumbwheel is at plus one- half. i'm going to take it to zero and back up to 1, and will set it at 122. it runs smoothly in both directions. i'm making an mtvc check in pitch. there's a little plus pitch, a little minus pitch - that's good - a little minus yaw, a little plus yaw. that's good and stable. i'm going to cmc control."
"okay, and, ron - -"
that's all right.
"houston, has my biomed settled down?"
"yeah, they start to get bloody stumps after while, don't they, charlie? 05 06 29 _0 lmp-lm that's exactly what they feel like, ed. but it's worth a bloody stub or two, i'll tell you. that _as really an experience!"

"oh, don't worry, orion; we'll worry."
"well, the signal strength oscillates when the antenna is in the ... but now what's'happened is the antenna is apparently driven off some amount and it's just staying there."

... - -
- - so i put the interconnects on the inlets and just let the air blow out of the hoses and take it all in through the suit circuit return. that might give you a little higher pressure rise.

"that is negative, karl."
"but it's a very light grain, very fine grain, sure looks like a basalt with some very - less than millimeter-size vesicles in it, maybe 5 percent or so. it's a subangular rock. it's friable - i can - maybe it's not a basalt. it's friable - i can scrape it off with my glove and i put some streaks in it, in case anybody wonders what that is when we get back. but, it's definitely different from anything we've seen before. 195 - let me get another one here."

"oh, you've been really packing them away."

how about this one up here? take your picture. i think we can just lift that off. see that?
did you get any photos in there?
"yes, yes. there are some very - -"
"11, houston. if that's not the earth, we're in trouble."
"okay. it goes up and then it goes back down again. don't ask me how the head compensates for it, because - the sinuses, i don't see how they can ever drain .... doctors ... it doesn't know it can't compensate."
"apollo ll, houston. three minutes to los; aos at 96 plus 20."
"yes, sir. right here. how you doing? lmm-eva my hands are getting tired."
"he's disappearing up into the tunnel, of course, _ as hewould going into the lunar module, only backwards. / _ ,ji"
mark cml=.
"all right, just a second (laughter)."
"i said, ""why don't we ...?"""
okay. and i 'm going to calculate in the 2 sec- onds in giving you the time hack coming up on 73:59:00 when i give the mark. okay. stand by.
"well, you can always zigzag."
"that's affirm, and then you'll leave it there for about 5 minutes. we'll cue you when to extend it again."
negative.
"but you want - you want to bear north, don't you, a - little?"
...
"huh? oh, yes."
... right ... 07 05 21 39 l_[p talk to him.
there we go. i did it that time.
"roger. we see it, jack. and we got a reading % of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. we'd 2.1 or 1.9. _ like to know it that's 2.0 precise or if it's . _ minated on the battery b."
i'll get the - - age
what does it say?
"that's the earth. now, i don't know whether we're oscillating back and forth or not, jack, or whether it's a continual motion. we'll have to see here."
"oh, yes. we need to see if - we can get some of the subfloor. i'm not sure i understand what's hap- pened here, yet. this should have brought up subfloor according to the theory, and it hasn't."
"- - ..., inject."
"hey, bob, just ignore everything he said. we'll leave him a pair of our scissors, and he's just worried about being hungry."
"houston, do you read?"
"hank, you asked me earlier about the configuration of the dse switches. was there some problem in the last time i reconfigured?"
okay. coming up.
hope nobody saw that.
"negative, dave. go ahead and stow it. we just don't want you to move the television camera. it's in the proper position now. we want you to go ahead and stow the antenna.."
yes.
"roger. and, be advised, this also changes your little graph over on the side there. primarily what it does, is to enlarge the mode 130 region by about 10 feet per second on either side and it -_ changes the ""lci plus 30 abort delta-v"" line by essentially extending it and raising the left-hand corner just a wee bit. we could read up the lines too if you want, but i'm not sure you really need those. over."
how are you doing down there?
"okay, houston. that's a good idea. what - what we're going to do is i'm getting this - -"
"okay. we're going with omnis_ at 10 minutes, give me circuit breaker landing radar, closed; your altitude transmitter. con fideni,t im"
"main a, bat c, charlie."
"roger; loud and clear, charlie. or was that charlie?"
trying to fit everybody into the window'.
why don't you set them - -
okay. we'll try it.
"it's still being worked on, jack. though we don't have any real concrete story to give you on it yet."
"go ahead, orion."
"america, before you open the equalization valve, we'd like one final reading on the lm/cm delta-p."
we got a po0 after that?
right.
okay. the burn was on time. the burn time was 5 plus 52; the residuals - - time skip
let me make sure here. we're standing by.
"... would do if i'd rake up-slope though, i bet you i'd get more."
"okay. i went to ""pseudo intermediate ,"" between minimum and intermediate. the bubble is just touching the - its circle, and the alignment - sun alignment is good."
understand; it's in sci?
- - the last one. we want to - -
okay. say when and how much.
"yes, right."
"oh, man, i got to just - -"
"roger, al."
"okay. jack, we've got to make a place in here for your - that full bag. let me put this small can over there, and core tube over there."
"okay, that's good; thank you."
"okay. no, i had 31 and 33, and i got sigma libra now, and it'll be 31 and 23 for the set stars."
"hey, that does sound more like a little vein or a cone to me. 06 06 00 _3 cmp well, it just looks so much like all the rest of the things around here, hank. the texture of the surface looks like it is all the same. the flanks of it are fairly steep though. and it's got one of the sharper rims for a raised rim crater of any that i've seen."
"okay; copy that. we don't need those, we just got them. and - -"
"that's fine, charlie. we see the problem."
okay; next spacecraft to powerup is going to commence right now.
"go ahead, houston."
tell him to give us a mark at 8 minutes.
"pro. i thought i had a stuck key, but it came out."
"15, houston. you're suit integrity check looks good as far as we can tell down here. 07 ll l? 48 c_p well, we had it for about 5 seconds there, and then the 02 flow went back up, so we'll hang on here and see if it comes back down. f_"
although i saw some last night when i went to sleep.
"and, houstcn marks 1 minute, and you've got good pumps."
got it.
"when you did your p76, dick, with my burn in it, did you get any noun 49's afterwards, or did it come right up with a good state vector?"
roger.
and there might be diamonds in the next one.
roger.
that didn't come out of the lm.
a-choo.
okay. will do.
"that would get me out of the way. c_ okay, just a second. okay."
"at 11 000, standing by for mains."
"yes, it looked like it was a little late, didn't it? when that light goes out, i'm going to start my timer."
"okay, i was just looking. those dumps really knocked us for a loop, didn't they?"
**# how's your tv lens? i don't have a lens brush. it looks good from here. i don't want to use this unless you think so. _vip-eva *** three times. satisfied?
all samples frc_ _.
"we're going to wait until he calls zero, and then move the switches."
"casper, this is houston. will you go auto?"
okay. _nat sounds fine.
"okay, houston, that won't take a second. okay, let me attach this bag to - would you attach this bag to me, pete?"
"eagle, hol_ton. go."
okay. we copy that.
why's that?
"the dial is 280. the th,-.bwheel is 270."
that 's great.
"no .... we had battery power for a while, we could ..."
okay.
"okay, dave and jim. spur is at bearing 346, range 4.6. 05 23 49 12 i_4p-eva oh, we're at - we're at spur then."
you're in good shape.
"yeah. i didn't get a chance to watch too much of that, but i did see one, when they were up on the southern point, they put the camera out on south ray and it was just magnificeat."
"hozuston, aquarius."
turning it off now.
"give you this monitor, dave."
"okay. the question was, do you want to take a look at the rotated vector in p40 before we start our maneuver, or can we go ahead and start the maneuver?"
i hope the guys in the back room who thought this up right knew what they were saying.
"okay, shall we go to intermediate on the cooling and see if it's working."
"i can, yes."
"okay. it's a pretty innocuous change. and the one - the line right above that, too - ""systems test 7-a, battery compartment pressure less than 1.5,"" change that to 3.4, also."
"- - the seal is already made. if we could tape those handles down, we'd probably have a vacuum in there. f 06 04 41 45 cdr-eva okay."
*** again. 04 08 23 06 l_ *** steering is in.
"okay, switch settings. let's go through that."
"can you swing in there, and let me get another shot of it?"
"there's a good size one right over here by my footprint. actually, i took pan i where pan 2 should have been. okay, looking down into plum, tony, there is some cobbles and things on the inner rim. but they aren't very large - maybe 30 centimeters or so is the biggest."
"roger; copy 25. 05 o0 24 03 _p okay, i'll get a lil - canister change."
"okay. hey, i'm going to do this the other way around, al. going to get my gloves on first; helmet last."
"holy christ, are those the right angles?"
"800 feet and we're at 8.8 feet per second. c_ looks like challenger's in good shape, i don't see anything hanging down or anything. cdr-_i she's in excellent shape. okay, we're at gs0 feet c_ okay."
i have vox now. vox sensitivity is up. pad c0_'s off. s-band's t/r. audio mode is normal. *** t/r. am's off.
"okay. 05 11 36 43 l}? don't get hung on there. anything? 0v 11 36 46 cdr no. 05 11 36 _7 12,p okay. that's the way; you're centered good this trip. that's good. move a little bit to the left - little bit to the left; there you go. you better get that antenna as you go. 05 !1 37 02 cdr okay. it's out. get it? )5 il 37 06 lnp yes, ready to go."
"right, it sure is."
let's grab a quick rover sample and we'll take off.
"in that way, i think you can see ... the sculptured hills."
"15, houston. ll 05 45 50 cml° go ahead, karl."
negative. they say not. don't scrub them too heavily.
can't argue with that.
"ags mode control, att hold."
roger. we're ready. you were watching it.
that's in work right now.
"apollo 16, houston. could you acquire with your high gain? 09 01 41 28 lnp didn't work."
roger.
"okay, jack. you're a - there you go. okay. _at does it look like to mou?"
"challenger, houston. no update on your lm weight."
"and, ron, if you'll just give us a mark when you make the shot. that'll be close enough and we'll - we'll mark the time here on those polarizing ones. so we'll get the angle that way."
"hold that bag - just a minute, pete."
i know. it won't go all the way. there it goes ....
yes.
i'm starving to death.
... little ... purge -
"okay, we got 150 on the pugs, unbalanced, decrease."
i won't be there for a minute. i'll tell you when i get there.
"say, buddy! ll 06 09 21 cml° stand by; we're maneuvering."
okay.
- - ... let me do it.
"... a little dirt? 05 04 06 51 i_p-eva oh, boy .... 05 04 07 22 i_p-eva ... what are you going to use for uht?"
"roger. we're ready to try a vhf check, if you will. we'd like you to go to vhf antenna, left, and all of you turn off your s-bands and turn on your vhf t/rs."
"understand on your first - okay, on that first step that you read, it said, if leak stops, to close both dump valves."
"through 90k, houston."
okay.
roger. i have no indication of it. (columbia )
that's affirmative.
there you go.
i can't believe it.
what's the - oh - 55? okay. purge. that son of a bitch went - -
"right. i'll give you the opens now. we want lighting: flood, main a, main b, and flight/ postlanding, closed."
pro ....
yes.
"that's right, jack. what i'm going to do is - we'll stop with the earth in the commander's window, the coas down, and then i'm going to maneuver the spacecraft so that i have the lighted portion of the earth at the top of the window; that is, the coas will be along the plus-y of the spacecraft and the top of the window - of the rendezvous window, i should be looking into the sun. that means i'll be burn- ing towards the sun and steepening the angle."
the same wrinkled lineations we saw trending - sloping uphill to the west on the eastern half of the massif are still very evident at this sun angle.
okay.
"okay, why don't you just tell me first what the general scheme is, how you're going to do that, while we're getting the book out."
outstanding.
"okay; we'll do that. thank you. l0 02 52 b8 cdr houston, 15. we're prepared to maneuver to the thermal attitude a little early if you'd like us to go over there."
"hey, tell him ... 08 ll 19 08 _ okay. ken just turned the camera over. you can have him - turn the other way now. then m_ybe the rest of you will stand on your heads."
"okay, standing by for throttledown."
probably was us.
remove ops and stow antenna lead. perform ops checkout. report ops pressure to houston. stow 0ps on engine cover. okay.
"and make sure you get the - not the wire, but the bottom of the screen over the loop."
okay. okay.
"okay, it was closed and now it's open. tape 970"
minus 6.68. i1 01 16 46 lmp this says 6.54.
i ought to get those.
okay; call p47. o0 04 15 13 cml° yes. okay. let me put a belt on here to just strap myself down a little bit.
"okay, babe; have a good time, and go get that landmark. don't forget - no teis. see you in about 3 days."
"okay, houston. we're at 2.7 on the delta-p on tunnel vent."
stand by 1. we'll look at it.
"okay, maybe one more. let's get a - whole bag full."
roger. understand.
"great place to pick it. two great places to whack it. oh, rats."
"do you want to go where station 5 is, bob?"
please tell those guys - please tell ken - -
"okay. when we changed the canister this morning, ron tells me, there was water back there, too."
roger. are they right on the target?
okay. get those haemus mountains right to the west of sulpicius gallus.
dsky's blank. aver - average g. twenty seconds. how do you read me? 05 23 01 31 cm2) ...
"okay, cabin pressure's coming up. *** suit pressure's coming up - in the cabin. f 04 10 37 53 lmp-i_ we might as well turn the urine line heater off."
- - stopwatch? 00 o0 51 o0 _ i'm looking for one.
...
okay. we can forget that one sample off the ...
i hope so. never get it out of lunar orbit unless you do.... jettison.
go ahead.
"0ooh, that one's stretched. pork and scalloped potatoes!"
okay.
"wait a minute; 02:23:57, i think it was."
"i know it. see, when you - okay. 06 04 28 40 [_4p-eva man, i'm glad that you - you're driving this t_ing. i can't reach those buttons down there at the bottom. you ought to get that before you get in."
"okay, we aim to please. that's also, i might tell you guys, the third time we've played that this morning, although you's only heard it twice. we played it once before we sent the crew alert."
"well, i meant to have the other angles."
"yes, affirmative, joe."
(laughter)
a little more?
"oh, manisehewitz. whew. lmp-e_ya there you go again."
okay.
and i got a control mode so i'm going to set my computer now.
0op - oop. it landed on a slope.
"that's what i meant. oh, you mean - and i got my thing down."
"wilco. 04 03 24 13 lmt_ houston, eagle. the rcs hot-fire is complete. how did you observe it? over."
"ags and pgns agree. hey, we're really going down range. look how we pitch, can't even see the horizon."
that's correct.
"okay, we go to dock; shaft/trunnion, 50. i'll park the antenna for you, al."
"go ahead, joe."
okay.
okay. it is locked.
just to the north and mostly to the west of canoe [?].
"okay, bob. it's rocked. the shadow ... - the shade is aligned to the sun now, antiit's level."
"roger, dave. we copy that. _ 05 21 31 01 cdr-lm okay, houston, hadley base here. getting ready for a coremcheck with the plsss if you're ready."
"well, - pretty much, i think, bob."
"i thought you had it, stu. confid"
"oh, stand by a minute, karl."
"okay, and we want to get gamma ray shield, on."
pressure's down.
(laughter )
just completed one.
"15, houston; the computer is yours."
"15, this is houston."
"don't lift it up, al, or my rock box to go."
"okay, cabin warning light off. verify cabin _ressure stable at 4.6 to 5. 06 06 03 10 t__p-lm it's tnere. yeah, it is. it's there."
"before the bu_v_, i guess."
"and i assume you're set up for these pictures coming up at 121, right? c_ip yes. it's funny, i can see bessel, but i'll be durn if i can see a copernican ray going across it - i mean a tycho ray going - copernican ray, i guess."
well - -
...
"roger there. 04 12 11 24 ia{p-i_ ags coming on to standby. 04 12 11 42 i_mp-i_ okay. master alarm and ags light. 04 12 12 06 ia_p-i_ okay, 10 ... 110:52:00 for the time on the ags."
"you wouldn't be proud of anything less, dave."
okay.
"no, that's ... canister."
"okay. i don't know how factual it is, but i remember getting a note the last week before launch that you had your rock control weight up to 215 pounds."
go ahead.
there you go.
"stand by on powering down the dsky, jim. we'll give you the procedure for that. the procedure that we - - 02 11_30 57 cdr okay."
"okay, i went back to surge/3; it did not. so maybe it's coming on when i go up to 1 slash 2."
stand by. that's a negative on the ascent eca breaker. leave it open.
"seriously, jack, when i stop the spacecraft looking at - at the earth, i'm going to have to roll - in lm terms, roll the spacecraft 90 de- grees to get the tip of the earth all on the y-axis."
no. pick a fairly level place - -
"in the interim, to help out main a voltage, i've got main bus tie bat ac on. or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on main a?"
roger.
"yes, that's quite a nav system. quite a system."
i - i still don't think that that's our decision- making process up there on the surface.
number 2. o1 06 4o 37 imp good.
okay.
"jack, you go to centerline and zero up there."
"okay, ken, if you'll go to accept, we'll send an up-link for you."
let's press on. we got the reading? let me put the rammer on your back and see if we can't get this on your camera.
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read now?"
i see it.
"oh, close reg a, huh? ()kay."
that ... switch?
...
"and, 13, houston. we'll be commanding the evasive maneuver in about 17 seconds."
okay.
"okay. understand, there are two steps there. the first one is gamma ray retract, barber pole for about two and a half minutes, then gray, and then turn it off. the second one is gamma ray gainstep to shield, on."
still going dowm.?
roger.
"3, 2, 1 -"
... plans. 04 0b 21 25 cdr okay.
"okay. i just ran out of film at 160. and i'm about two pictures short of the pan, and they're upslope. i think i can cover most of that with the 500."
okay; see you later.
"roger. houston copies, and we'll - -"
roger.
"roger, aquarius. go _tead."
"okay. while i'm trying to get a bite of lunch here, i thought i'd just tell you that after the dump, the same thing happened - the same kind of cloud, the same kind of particles that - that i _f described yesterday. and they've just about - they've just about dispersed now. well, you know, r karl, the interesting thing, i guess i hadn't thought about it before, but when you're sitting up here looking at the surface through one window, it's just pitch black out the other windows. so you go from a very bright scene in one window to a black in the other."
go ahead.
okay. re_l fine.
okay.
i mean the dps pressurization check.
"ah so. well, i put some new sensors on this morning before we got suited. when i get my suit off, i'll check it."
broke lock.
yes.
a to egress.
okay. i'm with you.
...
"okay, let's select suit fan 2; i'll get it. 04 17 11 16 l_ okay."
i know. let me get this one off and take a ... here.
mark.
looking for 44 miles - -
that a boy - -
we'd kind of lik_ to hold off on th_ - st_rl th_ venting again until we get the things - pumped back up inside here. wonder if you might give us a call to remind us when to initiate that.
"okay, i'll give you a mark, jack."
"okay. we wsylvco try _o get the slatform inertial again, and _nat we'd like for you tc do is a verb 23 nou__ 20 enter, enter, ver_ 40 e_._er. 01 14 37 07 cm_ verb 23 noun 20 enter. then you want me to put plus enter into that register. okay, that got rid of the gimbal lock light. now you'd like for me to do a verb 417"
"cabin gas return, egress."
good.
okay. let me get a couple of bags ahead here.
"okay, i'll go get them."
i'll get a locator from here.
"okay. ""pressure greater than 115"" is changed to ""124, oxidizer; 110, fuel."""
"okay. i give you a 2'701and _7266. 270], ±7266. 09 00 01 16 ._ew roger. c,opy."
okay. i got the heat flow for you.
yes.
i'll get it.
"okay. copy four balls 4, 105.56 three balls 45."
"okay; you're readable, fair amount of noise."
"and i'll take my pan from here, so you -"
"ken, we've got your flight plan here - -"
"okay, houston. we're gonna get out."
"there's 6, 6, 6 there, 6.2. don't see anything on master alarm."
"yes, let me - get my coffee here. ·00 01 12 04 cdr yes."
"charlie, could you check and see if the glycol mixing valve got bumped into auto, the temp in?"
okay. lgc. what am i doing? go.
"oh, but they always - they always give them to us in the simulator. hey, bob, judging from what i see on my clock, we're not but about 5 minutes behind."
this is the commander.
"is a fairly good-sized depression, but it's com- pletely mantled. there's no blocks showing in the wall at all. *** read, bob?"
"roger; under baker, column baker, line 4, change from 11522 to 13353, and, on line 5, change 13000 to 00041."
"and, 15, we have your e-memory dump."
"go ahead, 16."
roger.
"roger. we're ready for both of you guys, now."
why not?
roger; understand go for depress.
and there is no update to the tig. it's good as given to you earlier.
okay.
"i think we've got about the best configuration. we've been doing it all from the ground here, 11. we'll just keep it as it is. over."
okay. away from the sun. gnomon - you want the gn_non side or corner?
we don't unsuit until after undocking? 03 23 59 06 i_p yeah.
(laughter) okay. nothing showing up on the seismometer anyhow ...
trench sounds great. okay. 06 00 20 44 i_4p-eva trench or a core?
"yes, looks good. 0b 06 38 19 _ 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 -"
barber pole and gray.
"wait a minute. okay. wait a minute. 00 01 58 _ ocr _, 3, 2, i - 00 01 58 h8 cdr mark it."
okay.
he just doesn't know what an iss light will do to a boy.
"does that mean i'm clear to do a verb 46? okay. well, that still didn't work. i think maybe i've had one of those transients. for some reason, every time i pick up cmc auto, this thing starts doing maneuvers."
"and, 16; houston. i've got about five items for you here that'll wind it up for the night, i think. first of all, i'll start out talking about this battery compartment. we've looked at it now, over quite a period of time, and we feel that the pres- sure rise is due to a very tight cabin battery compartment that prevents any leakage from the compartment to the cabin. and also to the in- cremsed battery venting. now, the - the increased battery venting resulted from recharging the bat- teries longer than normal. and that in turn re- sulted from the high discharges during loi and doi burns. we really don't feel there's anything wrong with the batteries. in fact, right now, we're looking at a requirement from now until the end of the mission of about 30 amp-hours. and we've got about 100 amp-hours in the batteries right now. we'll continue to check the battery compartment pressure, but we really don't expect to have to vent the compartment or to perform any additional battery charging prior to entry. we'd like to get one more read-out prior to your going to sleep. we'll periodically check tomorrow, but in summary, we feel that there's really not a problem. and the odor that you mentioned is - is probably not from the battery compartment, but is more characteristic of the battery charger."
"okay. the other rocks that i was talking to you about are pretty well buried, and they're pretty large; i don't think i could get one of them going."
"okay; mighty fine, bob. 23 cdr and, bob, we've got the pyr0s armed now."
- - go to - receive only on the vhf for a little bit?
okay. i - let me call them.
"well, thank you for all your research in there, bob. i'll let the commander make the decisions. it - it's his thermostat."
okay. you got a mighty fast scamp ... to see all that.
"are you all ready to go, charlie?"
"yeah, we can, but i don't really see much - 06 23 29 08 _4p-eva boy, this equipment problem is really handicapping us. 06 23 29 24 _4p-eva okay. there's a - wow! boy, the regolith here, tony, up on this crater rim is really soft. we're sinking in on these slopes about 6 inches or so."
okay. very good.
"16, houston. let's try it again."
"america, houston; over."
"houston, aquarius."
"and how about a range and bearing when you stop, to take the picture."
"well, all right."
"okay, houston. you cut out, say again."
"go back in egress, pete."
... this other - but i don't want to get into your seat. we got those bags pi - packed in there like gangbusters. how are you doing there by yourself?
sounds good.
"17, houston. we noted down here that your suit diverters went to egress and we want the demand regs to the egress position, please. i_mp-i_ that's right, but the suit gas diverter extends when you go to egress."
"you bet you there, mike."
... what about ...
okay.
okay.
(laughter) i think that's called a ch_rmion event.
a and b also open.
"challenger, houston. you're stay for t-2, and go for the dps vent."
"okay, where are we ?."
...
under jim's couch?
"now, charlie. okay. let me get it -let me get it. just - -"
...
"15, houston. we'll have to stand by for another few hours to get you close enough to do that vhf comm check. 12 01 38 54 u_p all right. roger. we understand."
i'll give the ags an update; it might need it.
there she goes. it was a good one.
"okay, houston; we're right with you. we've just gone through that, and - we understand it. thank you."
"houston, you want the computer?"
"oh, we're muttering along, flying across the sea."
"if you can. you've got two little frags - well, that's better than nothing. got a bag? it's number 186."
"did you get the heat-flow pictures, by the way?"
through 8000 feet.
"okay, karl, if you're through with the news, let me give you some words on tsiolkovsky."
*** it?
we obviously stuck them back on the wall.
"cool it, jim. just take it easy. take a break. that 's enough."
%..
"roger, pete. we copy."
"okay, bob. the core tubes are going in scb-7 - i mean - yes, 7."
"okay, ken, how about let's starting with the flight plan changes for a couple of revs here and get that out of the way?"
"orion, houston."
"i saw a couple particles go by the window awhile back, and it looked a little bit like insulation in this - these particular case - styrofoam insula- tion, but in flat flakes."
"oh, yeah, i see. i got my head up against john. 10 03 13 19 _ that's too far."
"press reg in a and b - press reg a and b, closed."
what's what?
i'll check all circuit breakers.
okay. lmp-t__ there.
"hank, it looks like we made a little discrepancy here in the way it is now. it shows we crossed out the verb 48 at 97:15 to get us a 10101 because we were all ready there, i thought. and that doesn't look like the case. i guess we're gonna catch it up here after the burn. it is probably okay in its present form? is that correct?"
"oh, i'd estimate maybe a pint. yes."
we're taking them. we're taking them.
and we'd like you to still have a try at turning it over.
yes.
"we're happy as a clam. we just had a great time, having fun as well as the work."
"okay, let's - i tell you what - you sae right ahead of you -"
thank you.
"secs logic, two, on, up, verify."
i need - -
it's time to go?
keep coming up. just got mine on.
"geno, go ahead and try the handle on 9 and 7; and, if that doesn't work, cock them and refire them starting with 9, please."
"roger, endeavour. we're requesting you verify your systems - data systems, on, and the s-band aux switch to science, please."
stand by.
"okay, looks like about 3.4 - 3.5."
"stand by. f 05 09 06 b8 cdr-lm okay, joe, 709, bravo echo 5, and we moved out about 200 feet to the east of that point in picking _ up the c radial sample."
yes.
"- - getting familiar with the surface. the surface on which the forward footpad landed is extremely soft. as a matter of fact, it's in a small depres- sion. the - the soil is so soft that it comes up all the way to the top of the footpad; it even folded over the sides to some degree. the same is true of the plus-y strut."
"and endeavour, houston. we still don't have the pan camera, off, as far as we can see."
"okay, the landing radar h-dot is only reading minus 17 right now. the 8000 works okay."
"okay, john, you want to pull the rendezvous radar breakers?"
"well, again you can speak of test - or color dif- ferences on the thing. and the sun angle now look- ing west - you get the same streaked - well, the verticle streaks that i talked about before that you see on the backside at the high sun angle - higher sun angles again. and that seems to show up more and more, i think, at the higher sun angles. and these are the - what i call - radial - radial streaks down in the fresh craters that essentially start at the top of the crater rim and go down inside of them. if you take a look at these streaks, i don't - i don't see how they could be due strictly to the sun angle on them, i think, because they're all the way around the crater."
"in general, i think they do quite a good job, especially on the guns, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles. 01 03 31 f4 cc have the water temperatures been good? are you getting hot water?"
"is that upper or lower, jack?"
we'll worry about that later.
get your purge valve out and then i'll ... 02.
"okay, let me teli you w_t 2% was, gordon, i think, is the - the outlet was - was accidently open, probably at - at some other time, and the - the bypass was closed and the inlet was - was open. that's probably been the indications on the line. 00 o0 19 _7 cc roger. understand."
"yes, this is the san luis rey, luis complex, because see how elongated it is?"
36 - thank you ....
okay. helium tank temp.
okay. go ahead.
two balls.
"yes, i'll do it. is he going - he's going to try to lock up on us i guess, huh?"
"okay. we're on the top of 3-28, gordo. hey, ronl"
fine with me.
"falcon, the computer is yours."
okay. did you see anything worth talking about up there before aos?
okay. lm_-lm okay.
roger. i copy one at 20 seconds and one at 2 seconds.
copy.
- - that's ... a block.
yeah. i don't think the rocks that are there were there because of -
"and, 15; houston. one more thing if it's convenient."
"okay, understand, joe."
roger.
yes.
"powering down now. okay, we trim here in about - just short of 100."
this is really some place.
why don't you throw it out right now? 04 22 54 50 _ that's a good idea.
"standby, jack."
- - that green material.
okay. and i'll just use the settings off the photo wheel the same as we use for the 250.
"yes, sir. go."
_ won't even comment on that one.
go ahead.
okay. i'll get them.
okay. and i put battery a on charge at 105:35.
houston. roger. out. o1 03 07 ]0 cmp how is eecomm today? is he happy with lll those good things ?
- - have punched through.
"yes, i know it."
"yankee clipper, houston."
"okay. looking to the right, the lm attitude or rather the csm attitude will be incorrect, so you can cross that off. and beneath the picture of the moon, cross out the - in parentheses, ""108.19"" and the ""0 230/018, 0"""
"okay, jim. understand."
is it?
"oh, is that right? oh, i thought it was 240. that's where i missed it."
you want p - okay.
stand by. i'll check on that.
roger. omni charlie.
"sta_ndby, charlie."
"i don't - well, we're supposed to swap, yeah. 09 20 o0 39 izmp am i supposed to be on it all this time?"
okay. let's - you go bravo. i go alfa.
vesicle pipes.
...
"houston, aquarius."
huh?
"okay, jack. i'm going to find out in a minute."
"okay, fai_ c_era to st_i'_dby_ and we'll deploy the g-_mna ray. 08 09 22 36 c_,_ okay. the gmmma ray's going out."
yes.
"okay. _-_ cc ""pre-sps burn - burn sim prep cue card."" let me read that again. ""pre-sps burn sim prep cue card."" another statement: ""secure equipment for trim/ lopc."""
here's a bag; want to hang onto it?
roger. copy minus 3.8.
"ail right, your lm dap data first: csm weight, 37679; lm weight, 36630. your gda drive angles on board are good."
"okay. i?e have both water hags clear. hatch is coming open. and you want to ,_et my antenna on the way out?"
[roger. it looks good.
i believe that's correct.
"how big's the hole look, geno?"
okay.
there you go. go to lgc.
"yes, when i read it out to you. not before."
"houston, columbia. (cot,trivia)"
"okay, stand by."
okay; 281.
"roger. there are some very steep slopes that just have grazing sun on them now, and with the binocs, you can see that horizontal lineation pattern."
right over there.
"that's that noise again that we had yesterday, remember?"
"descent propet.iant isol valve, fire."
"orion, this is houston. read you loud and clear. 04 0k 05 27 lmp roger. same-o, jim. we're about 0.7 of a mile out from casper now. 04 oh 05 42 cc say again, charlie. we still have excessive noise ·here. oh 04 05 48 lmp i say our range to casper is about 0.7 of a mile. 04 0k 05 52 cdr and he's opening at 2-1/2. he put in some posigrade velocity to go up and above and come down and get with us."
...
"i don't know what to set it on - 74, i guess. we're not that far away."
okay. i'll let you get - -
"door jett's off, down."
i have ignition.
"affirm. under ""dps press,"" step 1, line 1, scratch. line 4, ""descent helium reg 1, talkbaek barber pole."" under step 2, scratch; step 3, scratch; ""landtng gear deploy,"" scratch. over."
should be a 3-second burn.
"yes, i'm glad you called that, ed. it shows you what you can do. i had apparently knocked that thing to 24 frames per second. 00 02 10 o1 lzfp really?"
"roger. and, dave, the diverter valve is yours."
"there, you got it. it went in."
image motion coming on -
"oh, yeah; throw it in my bag."
"roger, ron. we copy you. you might try and ad- just your vox, thumbwheel down a little bit. it might help us a bit, knock out some of the back- ground noise."
"okay, h-dot is high right now."
"oh, man. okay, i'm out here."
"- - and that particular material - that par - let me finish, bob! that particular rim material there continues around to the due north, and then there's a drastic change again where you see the - the inner rim completely terraced with this boulder fill."
i don't know. where are they?
that'll probably take a good 5 minutes to get up there.
okay; thank you.
"okay. first one _-illbe the circ pad, o_. the same page."
and that's a plus.
that's sherlock over that rim over there.
"hey! how did you ever get l-2 closed, al?"
"okay, it's omni delta now."
"okay, ken."
"i tell you, i really wish you guys could have been here with us. you worked as hard at it as we did, if not harder."
"okay .... at 15, i ..."
"mine, too; 375."
"mark. okay, the second one went in with no prob- lem, tony. 05 01 31_24 cc good show. 05 01 34 34 i_mp-eva man, what a place."
okay. what else do we have to ...
okay.
"you can't help yourself, can you?"
"roger. i copied all that, karl. tape8/3"
"you're loud and clear, ron. how are we?"
"okay. understand. stay for t-2, and go for the dps vent. let me get out of - okay, we can't hack that. i'm going to get out at 12. 2-20 _ [ day 5"
_o.
"after there, for the fillet. and after there, for the material around. okay. let's try the old h_vner."
okay; do i still have a positive closure rate?
"okay. and, houston; vance."
that's affirmative. presently about a mile ahead of the lm. and i'd like to talk about a tvc servo loop problem.
"okay. our so]utions are good enough, we'll go - go with your pgns, al."
good.
",)kay, let's turn it off."
... 03 14 12 52 _ i hacked your burn time as 20.6.
like this. two-legged hop.
"okay, we're getting ready to start the zero-phase observations on target 1. i'm now running - det was started at - t-start at 111:59:43 and i'm wa_ting to try again."
"johnny, you ain't gonna believe this, but the food is blown up like - like a balloon."
roger. we copy that.
roger.
okay.
is it really?
"yes. for some reason, the battery is burned out in the flashlight, but - let me see, it's about - i would say 400, i think. yes, let's see, its division marks on that gage are 3, 6, and 900. and it's above the 3."
"roger, pete."
"just as i was coming up on the landing site that time_ i saw this - little, very soft dome sitting up, and it's got this bright white ray crater right in the top of it. it's just like a - the crater itself looks like south ray, and the - except it's built up on top of this nice little dome. and i don't know if that's coincidental, or what, but it sure is an interesting thing. the crater is about a third the size of the dome itself."
that's neat.
get the what?
yes. cm_ okay.
"yes, let's get that. that's a good idea. ail the rocks we've been looking at, houston, in this area, seem to be the same. they seem to have a - the rock has got dirt built up on all sides of it, all directions."
"okay. while my compatriots are carrying out their respective tasks, i'm going to go off the air here for a - a few short minutes. and give you a call when i get back."
"okay. i copy that, jack."
"and, 15, it's your computer again."
"roger, understand. probably the same as we've been doing before. we dump down to l0 percent, but not below l0 percent."
"okay, at 136:47, write in ""verb 48"" and we go back to (11101) and zero and four ones. cma° okay. at 44, we - verb 22_ noun 78 [sic] - that changes to 72.24 degrees. and verb 58. okay, then we - we're going to stay at that attitude for 20 seconds. then change it hack to plus-x forward sim bay attitude again. and as soon as we get back, we'll change our dap back to two tenths of a degree per second."
"okay. jack, on 16, cabin repress, open, and cabin repress valve, closed. lmp, okay; cabin repress. circuit breaker first, right?"
"houston, do you read casper?"
"i think before activities get too far away, i will take a crap."
got about 20 degrees of pitch and about 30 degrees of roll.
could sure see a flash.
take pictures next rev.
go.
"amp-hours are 108 105, and batteries are 100 and 120. _ cc okay. copy 100 and 120."
"we're right at the - the edge of the rille, i bet you."
let me get your bags - i left my camera off when i -
"yeah, i was, too. and, actually, that's about the same score for the one that's out here by lassell."
"for information, joe, we're all configured back again now to our regular seating positions, if you're monitoring us."
"look at your inertial ball; it's showing right on the money, too."
...
"hey, guys, - 00 18 30 54 cml° - yes, not yet. 00 18 31 11 cmlp yes, it's on there."
okay.
...?
"copy, al. second question, do you want me to con- tinue giving the - you these real-time marks on air - air-to-ground, just before and after various camera passes? tape1bo/6"
roger.
*** we're going to put *** two bags on the rear there on our plsss?
"what's it look like? if it doesn't look worthwhile stopping, i'll move on up over there."
"bob, this is jim. bob, this is jim c-lling."
"15, houston. you can turn off the tv anytime you like."
okay.
"yes. okay. 06 03 14 28 i,qp-eva i'll hold it open."
ten seconds.
yes. i could call touchdown on the shadow. look at that. really here.
drop that baby.
"gordo, i'll give you a quick burn report. the burn was on time. burn time was 2 minutes and 23 seconds. delta-vgx was 3047.0. attitude at the end of the burn was 184, 005, 359. that's i84_ 005, and 359. there was no trim. the r_.sld- uals are minus 2, plus 0.7 - correction, minus 0.2, mlus 0.7, and plus 0.2. delta-v c was minus l:_.i. ._._ roger. we got those. 09 15 21 i_ lmp and, go,dy, _he unbalance is about 30 pounds, and oxidizer is 2.3 and fuel 2.9, and i blew fjll decrease the whole burn. _ roger, jack. _,_jp how' s the picture look, go,ay?"
it's in motion.
... good morning.
yes. ob 13 36 50 cdr holy smoley. man! i think they - they're ready to hold a 20-pound moose down with that.
look at that one.
roger. understand. we're number i on the runway.
"all right. we'll plan it that way. over. (tranq ) 04 09 16 142 cc roger, tranquility."
"16, we noticed the cabin pressure drop about a tenth and the 02 flow go up a little bit. are you doing something that might have caused that?"
you better believe.
"oh, man, is that heavy! holy smoley!"
those are called the loveletts.
"okay. and you want me to dump them both at the same time, right?"
kick that back.
okay.
he's - -
"eagle, columbia. my p22 is complete. i'm con- tinuing this maneuver to ags cal attitude."
"row about the other one? i can get the other one, too, if you want."
and the switch is off.
roger. we've got his heartbeat way up.
okay. thank you.
roger. eagle is undocked. (eag le )
"charlie, we'd like you - - 05 02 05 42 iaip-eva tony, there's a -"
"hey, is the zoom in too much, gordo? you - let me take it out a little bit."
"okay, ops set?"
roger.
"ail righty. and then, next line, ""attitude dead band, max; rate, low; and li_t cycle, on."" that's all on that page."
you can leave that - you can leave all your breakers in.
okay. check your cb configuration while we wait.
"f_ey,ken, why dcn't you just stop it and then start it again."
"you know, we're starting right in plane according to the ags. no out-of-plane velocity."
"houston, america. go ahead."
"okay. and overhead, auto and locked?"
okay. we cut off on a vi of 35614. tfc was plus 02; vg was .o. 05; delta-v c ... minus ... 4.5 ... h-dot ... and altitude is 167.4.
"okay, we copy."
"gordo, that was the first time i heard that and i got to say - i got to say that is beautiful."
"okay, verify ecs caution, h20 sep component lights; try in a minute. okay; there they come. suit gas diverter, pull/egress; verify?"
"apollo 11, houston. i have your base-line altitude update now, if buzz is ready to copy."
okay.
"still didn't understand, fred. i'm sorry."
okay. we're going to sign off here.
"roger. accepting. it's going in. 04 08 33 56 l_ and, houston, ed batteries check. 04 08 34 10 l_ four minutes. altitude is 2000 high."
"because i can't hold it shut and bring it in. charlie, you got my foot?"
"how do you read, jim? over."
"okay, back in bypass. 00 00 35 03 i24p okay. i'm ready to set a configuration here. i need the glycol reservoir bypass valve to open."
"yes, yes - -"
"roger, al. we copy that."
"okay, we - -"
"apollo 16, houston. 02 09 22 19 lm}_ go ahead, tony."
minus 86 - -
roger. request forward omni.
(humming) and it's pretty good fishing. ?h=_ 's what they had in the dead band. c).zp down this time -
"dumdum, tunk-e tunk-e tum. trying to learn to move faster. pretty good. hey, i feel great. how long we been out, houston?"
okay. coming down.
okay.
"and the other question is, does it look like we're going to have another midcourse, and which one and how much is it?"
"hello, apollo 11. houston. we recommend you accept the noun 49 display on the dsky now. over."
- - ... little coas ...
roger.
keep augering.
"see you gordy, and thanks for keeping an eye on us."
"okay, houston; we'll sep at 4:18."
"okay, we got the description; it's - can you guys see how really spectacular the view is?"
"okay. good. 06 04 46 56 lm_-e_a okay. we're coming up on that area now as we top a rise - a ridge that is bouldery, about i0 to 12 percent of area is covered with boulders greater than 50 centimeters. and it's cobbley covering about 60 percent. looks like we - apparently a secondary around here somewhere caused all this. but we don't see the crater."
absolutely incredible. absolutely incredible.
"auto, auto."
okay.
copy that.
yes.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"you'll have to rotate the helmet, too. shift it jus_ a little bit. no_ too much. shift it back, just a little bit more, a little more to the right - little more - little more. that's - good. back a little to the left. that's right on."
"oh, wait a minute. i got - i got - well, maybe it isn't a dikelet. maybe it's just a screen covering, a flow covering."
"yes, i heard it that time."
336.4. roger.
"okay, 13. we verify that we want you to close down - shut down fuel cell 1, close reacs valve."
are you on the ground?
"no, i've got to have some. i got to get some, or i can't take -"
yes.
and - - 00 o1 17 0b cmp ... o0 01 17 05 _ who has the tape?

you guys are on your toes down there.
okay. verify that the glycol was pulled?
we almost got it.
"very nice, ken. beautiful color."
roger.
"in fact, the azimuth setting seems to be getting tighter and tighter. i don't understand that, but that - you know - that's what it seems to be doing."
"okay. we'll be calling you for the ir, off, before you go to sleep. want to leave it on right up to the last minute, i guess. let me see if we can do this next one. okay. why don't you just go ahead and do this one? h2 fans for sleep - num- ber l, off, and 3 in auto."
because i notice - i feel - i feel a little warmer today than i did yesterday.
roger. stand by.
"okay. at ignition, if no ignition?"
"ken, this in plane may be mighty bad if the sun comes up and hits you in the eyes. i don't know which way you're pointed."
"roger; standby, and image motion, off, and laser altimeter, off. and retracting the - retracting the camera, now."
"okay, houston. we're getting ready to do the light-flash experiment, and we'd like to run the tape recorder so we can get the voice marks on it, if that won't interfere with any of your ..."
very well.
"yankee clipper, houston. over."
"hello, houston. endeavour's on the way home with a burn status report for you."
they're packing up to move on down to station 6 now.
"let me hold this end. let me hold it, and you put the bag on."
"no. i - i, you see i - i've stripped it, i think. i didn't think i could do it."
where?
"and, ron, we'd like you to stay nominal on the heating time due to the film limitation."
okay. there's my h20 full - flag.
"we've got garble now, jim; itm sorry."
"how you doing over there, stu? age 'confidentia,l day"
okay.
"okay, now she's low."
picked up right there.
"okay. got it. and, charlie, we'll need a frame count."
...
"okay, last drink. 06 18 59 47 lmp-i2_ okay, got that back as far as we possibly can. there, ..."
yeah.
"okay. looking back towards stone mountain, tony - - 06 05 23 2h cdr-eva charlie, let me park the i2q right here."
we're about a minute up.
i can tell.
"oh, that's right. oh, i knew that. i'm not thinking too well."
when are we supposed to cap the relief valves on our suits? 09 05 46 58 cml° ...
seven minutes. a thousand high. h-dot just about on. oxidizer's running just about 1 percent iow.
"yeah, i'm supposed to do that, ain't i?"
"we asked you what the comm was, and that fixed it."
it's do_m that way; come up - -
"aquarius, houston. over. 03 00 28 49 ia{p houston, aquarius."
"okay. the next coarse aline angles for entry refsmmat. okay. the next, cmc angles on entry refsmmat for (1) lm jett, (2) moon viewing, (3) entry. okay. i'll stand by until you read that back."
"okay, we're back to here - to position on mikes."
okay. would you - would you believe that's what i did on eratosthenes and also on copernicus?
"houston, how do you read 177"
"gee, i don't see it, do you?"
"copy. 07 03 45 09 lmp-i_m hey, we got a master alarm on the ags, but we trimmed the ags."
"roger, bob."

"okay. that was our network problem, not your problem on board."
yes. bring il down he_'e. one lm cue card. i get that.
"_._r_at'tshe - yes, let's see what the angles look like."
"p_te, looking out of the hatch window towards the - back at the moon, i think this view_s even getting more stunning, and - just brilliant whites and grays against a stark black background - looks like it's not even real."
try.
full of quick energy.
moonset.
"okay, karl. stand by 1."
okay.
okay.
"okay, al; that sounds good to us and we'll be watching."
we're doing that.
"hotspots on the moon, jack."
"closed. o0 o0 40 24 _ glycol reservoir in valve, closed."
"... slowly, that really ..."
i'll change it here. it's just as easy while we're in there.
"okay. there's not a whole lot of news on the wire tonight, matter of fact. president nixon received a firsthand report on private vietnam peace negotiations today from a key member of the u.s. negotiating team, general alexander haig, jr., henry kissinger's chief lieutenant. haig flew back from paris to report to the president, while technical experts from both sides held an unusual sunday meeting in the french capitol. presidential assistant kissinger will res_n_e his talks with north vietnam's le duc tho on monday after a 1-day recess. and former president harry truman continued to show some signs of improvement late today after he was earlier removed from the crit- ical list at research hospital up , up in kansas city. his cardiac situation has improved, and this improvement included a slower and stronger pulse and a stable blood pressure. the football scores are as follows in the national football league today: the bears defeated the eagles 21 to 12; the detroit lions and the buffalo bills played to a 21-21 standoff; dolphins extended their undefeated streak 23 to 13 over the new york giants; the patriots defeated the new orleans saints 17 to 10; green bay sewed up the central division of the nfc by defeating the vikings 23 to 7; the cardinals upset the rams today 24 to 14; denver defeated san diego 38-13; kansas city upset baltimore 24 to 10; the 49ers defeated the falcons 20 to nothing, 20 to 0; and pittsburg defeated houston 9 to 3, and they - they took the central division of the afc. so the playoff picture is becoming a little clearer. you've got - in the nfc, you've got washington, dallas, and green bay. and the fourth team will either be san francisco, los angeles, or atlanta. that will be decided next week. in the afc, pittsburg, mirmi, and oakland are in it. and the fourth team will be either the jets - and another team. they've got the giants listed here, but it can't be the giants because that's the wrong division. so we'll - we'll check that one out. cleveland; okay, cleveland. the fourth team is either going to be cleveland or the jets. and did you get a spurious master caution and warning?"
roger. we copy that.
that m-kes me feel like i'm coming over to do some sampling. think how it would have been if you were standing therebefore that boulder came by.
"and, al, if you read. let's come around to ao$. trying to get comm. we'll have a lot of work to do."
02:23:37.
"took you a while, didn't it?"
okay; 2.35.
"okay, tony. we're at 3.0 at 3.55. driving west, along a bench, trying to find a blocky crater."
"no, no, no. in here, ed."
"okay, for the lmp, the food eaten - well, let's see, i guess it's a tossup: eaten versus not eaten, so i'll give you what i ate. sausage patties, grits, pears, pineapple-grapefruit drink, coffee, and let me make a note that the package of peaches in that pack had been - was broken in the package. also, chicken - i had chicken soup, ham, bread, orange drink, and four bacon squares. for dinner, i sort of ate some leftovers and grape drink, corn chowder, chocolate pudding. and i've had - well, standby. the prd reading: 24080; and 7-1/2 hours of very good sleep last night. i took a seconal in order to get to sleep, and i've had i and i or - 2-1/2 containers of water since last report."
"okay, you want the receiver on - -"
"well, the pin's out. the rods. the whole saddle up here is still on. both pins are out. see what i mean? 05 00 23 09 t_p-eva i think we can maybe lift the front end up, can't we?"
okay. ?
"okay, go ahead. it was changed to 16."
"okay, and we're going to keep it nominal."
"yes, sir. *** not the time to rush. it's the time to do it nice and slow and right."
ready.
is it in the activation checklist or is it in the flight plan?
there's omni delta.
okay. holding at 3.
okay - -
"houston, do you read challenger?"
"15, this is houston. joe just came up from below to tell us that farouk and company are ecstatic about what you've told them so far and that all of the sim bay experiments are looking to be in excellent shape."
okay - skip.
"and then lights up, enable jets, and do a verb 49 to another target."
"roger, guys. the attitude which you're currently holding is a good attitude for your p52, if one of you wants to get started on that. we'll have some words for you on the sim bay problem in a few min- utes, and then we'll want to be talking about the sps burn coming up pretty shortly here. that is, we want to talk about it shortly; it won't be coming up for a while."
"okay. for general information, we're planning midcourse 2 tomorrow at about 35:30, and it should be about 10 feet per second."
- - stuff like that.
dsky's blank .... average g.
"oh, i mean the outer rim, the - the rim of it. 06 o0 b2 05 lmp-eva okay, i did that. it's still centered and gimbal is swinging."
ckay; do the rates look okay to you?
okay. you wanted me to change the modulate switch to pm? is that affirm?
"okay. we haven't removed it from its stowage spot. we just left it right in place, and just - he mated the tank at the end of the cable and hooked right into that."
"surface checklist, charlie."
uh-huh. in the same direction?
"well, you're - let me wander over that way. that's where i want to get, but i couldn't go there because of that -"
"yes. next time i'll carry it up the ladder to you. there you go, babe."
"these helmet - these helmet bags, the plate - the - the snap caved in over here and you can't get it snapped."
"- - ... about the - no, you never came over there and watched us do it from 9 miles."
"roger. we've got you down in the checklist, the step just prior to ""s-b_d aux tv to sci."" do you concur on that? c_ yes. we're still keeping tv and dac cables and what have you up to the pole."
"okay, it's level, but the sun reading is 0 - 064-1/2. is that okay, houston?"
"bob, i'm going to pan forward a little bit, and you can see the beginnings of the apennine front showing up on the far side of serenitatis."
"wait a minute. okay. i got it. hey, you're in good shape."
not at the camera.
hauling mail.
"bob, i'm going to have to give you a good battery brushing at the next site. i can't get - i get half of them, but i can't get the other half. it's too slopey."
okay; in work.
"boy, it's just over hill and dale, isn't it?"
okay. that's a good time to do it.
"the clock counts backwards. well, there you go. 04 02 02 38 imp let's go to pdi attitude then."
yes.
(laughter) that thing wouldn't even vibrate on a saturn v.
"yes. let's go down here - you know - a ways out in the ejecta, and see if we can get a couple more. here's a nice big one. it's too big for the bag. there's so much sparklies in it, jim. think we can get that in the bag? i'll try."
east massif has outcrops on it. i can see now on the north side. and they also tend to have linear upper terminations. and some of those line up as if there's roughly horizontal structure within the upper one-half of the east massif.
"okay. turn to 17 hours in the flight plan, page 18."
okay.
"here you go. now, what do you need of these? 04 20 39 08 _ i need anything you've got. there you go - -"
... 172 to 27.
okay; i didn't get it. let me plus x it.
two.
"oh, here."
"roger that, jack."
okay. he's working at it.
"okay. the only comment that we just made was that, in case you were thinking of stopping ptc, there's no need to stop it until 55 get when tv starts."
"okay. the top of the panel is dusted, tony."
roger. i'll buy that.
"very good, guys. we'll see you in a few days. thanks a lot."
i think i can see the rim of camelot. *** moment of my life.
"yes. it's saying 093 and heading 08, so coming right's going to help us some."
install the guard.
"okay. we could see you zoom in on the moon, and it's near the center of our screen, just a little to the left. very clear."
"ail i got to say, al, is good luck."
"roger, 16. copy you loud and clear."
"okay, that's one stroke backwards now. okay, ratchet handle and installation strut are restowed. capture latch release handle. o1 15 57 08 c_ okay, capture latch release handle is rotated 180 degrees and it's back in the recess. okay, let's see if it comes out. o1 15 57 20 (clanking noise) 0! 15 57 22 cmp ooops. there it comes. i couldn't see it awhile ago. let me look - the probe strut in the way. that's why you can't see it until now. where do we want to go with this thing down over here at the -"
about 45 seconds to los. see you coming home.
that 's affirm.
hear it rattling. it must be pretty close to attitude. yes.
- - plus 1.
"houston, 15."
"no, you - x and z, forget the y."
electrical looked?
"okay. you could'ye just said, move it."
"every - well, a lot of it's working, we've just got to try and see if we can't level this thing tonight. when you get off there, jack, i'll talk to you a bit about procedures for that. and in the meanwhile, it's my understanding - -"
okay.
roger.
let's see if i can't crack the corner and get that contact.
okay. is it free now?
"no_ we're just going to turn it off now. i'm sorry, charlie."
257. okay ....
"okay, 2000."
"okay, hank. we're closed out. the tunnel vent - the tunnel is being vented now. one question on that lm - that was a pretty big bird. you got enough rcs - i did not crossfeed. you got enough rcs?"
"yes, the leb was cloudy, cold, and snowy last night."
"dump a potable, closed."
02 plus 50 at hawaii.
"okay. t-start time, 166:42:12; t-stop time, 47:10."
"oh, it's just the way things pop off down here in one-sixth g. okay. won't be long and i'll get to my favorite task, pointing the antenna."
excuse me.
"yes. crenulations, you might say, in the slope that look something like those i saw from orbit - looking in the shadowed area - at the edge of the shadows. bob, we've seen craters as much as - 20 meters, maybe 30 meters in diameter without blocky rims."
ain't any that big. pag2e08 i'confident day
"hey, houston - is the dimple crater right behind the lm? is that - it's a big blocky impact crater. 05 14 37 19 l_,_ that ma.v be cool enough back in min cooling."
"roger, dave. we agree. - -"
...
okay.
"okay, al. mostly questions here about the con- tamination status and things in the sim bay. first of all, how about the - the - the door eder - the door edges? did they blow off smoothly and cleanly?"
"for this. and i didn't know whether that - what that'd do - they said to change noun 79 dead band to 2 degrees. i didn't know what number that was. 09 2b 21 23 cmp that's good. you did it right. 09 23 21 b7 cdr when's the press conference? it's a long ways from now, isn't it - 4 hours?"
- - we're standing by for rover powerdown and tv remote.
"okay; loud and clear. how me, jack?"
that's 12 and 13. 06 00 lb 56 cmp okay; 12 and 13.
tv camera is positioned. antenna is stowed.
"647 and 315, 61.4."

"yes, that's what i'm wondering m_self, you know."
that's right. we did ... over.
"sounds good, charlie."
yeah.
merriam would be down over the ridge.
"..., dave."
"tranquility base, houston. we've now collected all the ranging data that we can use, and you can go back to caution and warning enable. over."
i can't get it?
"endeavour, houston. we're going to hand you over no_g."
"roger. copy. i don't think we have anything else, dave. we noticed you did seem to have some trouble getting a suit integrity check the second time around, also. is that right?"
i got ahold of it.
let me ask you a question. is mine tight?
"no, it's great, john."
"stand by, ken."
"okay, let me get out - -"
"antares, kitty hawk, 05 22 33 35 (',dr go ahead? 13522 33 37 c_p hey, i was wondering if i could get, say, 20 se2- oncs; see if i could get the vhf !ocke'j u_? 05 22 33 12 i2_? say when you need it."
"you better believe it. and, of course, everybody sends their love. and over in e1 lago, they're, well - go ahead, gene."
"11, how do you read me? over. 02 06 51 55 c_ read you loud and clear, charlie. we just switched to high gain, and we stopped ptc at roll 263, pitch 90, yaw 0. how do you read?"
"okay, have at it. and remember we're looking for shaded samples and east-west cracks and all that kind of thing."
"okay, dave. that sounds good."
"okay, houston. let's hold off on the updates of those other photos, so we can get squared away for the eclipse photos."
correction received.
"good thought, al."
"go ahead, charlie."
"if you're looking at me, what i'm talking about is this depression - is this depression in here for the core - oh, maybe 15, 20 meters out in here. jack, what did you have in mind for the neutron flux?"
"roger. we're not rushing, just going at it system- atically. we apparently learned how to do it, though, somewhere along the line."
i think we can give you something. stand by a minute.
"okay. s-band transmitter/receiver, secondaey. ok 22 47 26 li_z? okay, it's secondary."
"yes - we'll get them to do that next time. but look at the rover tracks; i'm going to take some pictures of the rover tracks here. and our boots - our boot prints, both. look at the difference. that old rover is light."
okay.
"yes. maybe it's just not - _ybe i'm still getting too much flow. that purge valve is open, isn't it, in low?"
"at 215:17, we add ""map camera, on, switch off, parenthesis t-stop; laser altimeter, off; map camera, on, standby, t-stop plus 30 seconds. map camera image motion, off."""
"okay, i've got to switch to window number 3 for end of target. say again, the target number."
*** have you guys moving in 10 minutes. and we'd like to also deploy ep number 5 here.
"okay, there's our 30 seconds."
"all right. 05 21 50 02 cdr-lmp too loud. 05 21 50 03 lmp-ir yes. 05 21 50 04 cdr-ir okay. you're loud and clear. 05 21 50 06 _mp-ir houston, how do you read the lmp?"
"roger, dave. interesting."
"no, stand by."
shouldn't.
"we don't have any telemetry here. 04 22 57 41 _._-lm oh, yeah? 04 22 57 46 cdr-imm i believe you can take your visor down, charlie."
"roger. 09 05 40 45 imp okay. do you want us to wait until 30, or can we start maneuvering now?"
"apollo 16, houston. we've got a flight up - flight plan update we would like to get up to you, if we could get one of you to doff a suit right quick. it would be easier to copy."
"copy. 07 01 _5 36 cmp well, we finally got a little serendipity, hank."
"copy; 82 percent. 12 0i 42 07 cc apollo 15, houston. over."
all right.
"okay, ron. it's been a minute."
"have you got the update book omt, jim?"
huh?
...
"well, good evening, vance."
roger. it's 5.6.
"doing fine, bob. we've slowed down between about 5 to 8 - maybe 5 to 10 clicks most of the time. i'm going to head right up there, i think. get around this crater."
"okay, _ function, delta-v. that's a verify."
okay.
okay.
"endeavour, houston. reminder: about - slightly less than 4 minutes now to t-start for the pan camera."
"that what you got, joe, papa?"
we'll proceed. here's our residuals.
"good morning, hadley base; this is houston, and we're ready to talk over the eva."
"they called us from the control center a little while - well, before v'eleft the surface, and said now, on the docking - on the normal docking, the first attempt, they want us to thrust plus-m with you anyway."
"well, that was the reason ..."
"roger. we'll add that, and continue to keep the score."
"what am i doing wrong, john?"
"okay, that's an easy one. i'll delete that line that says ""map camera image motion, on, tal_back barber pole in 3 to 5 seconds, then gray."""
"yes, i can, but it will he - it'll be more towards the - the porta - the portable - i mean the lsm."
"roger, 195. and, it sounds green to me."
"hey, can't you pilfer more there? yes ...."
*** big bag.
how's everybody doing down there at mcc? time skip

"yes, i'll come up there. (laughter) i'm stuck. oh, i can - i can get it. can you do it?"
"coming? 06 21 38 26 i_-eva yes, right behind you."
"roger. we have it, and i'm sure that ed would like a good dusting job up front."
okay.
"we've already used a little more than i do in the simulator for some reason. o0 03 ih 59 cmp okay, houston. we've hit it twice and - sure looks like we're closing fast enough. i'm going to back ba_k out here and try it again. o0 03 15 24 ci_p well, there goes the record."
"ohhh, brother!"
okay. i take it from that they're coming up unsuited.

"well, we're right on the limit there .... firing it."
the first thing they put up was - -
huh?
"okay, joe. i'd suggest that we drive on down to that white crater and take the 500's from there. and i can do 500's while jim's taking a pan. how's that sound?"
"that's a good readback. cdr-_! okay, that's out of - okay, at 12:12, jack, we'll do the x, z, y. i'll do minus 4. then i'll do plus 1; and then i'll get the y. that's going to be aft_ for_ard_ and left. at _2:12, another minute. l_-lm okay."
is the skipper in the sack now?
okay. john's coming up.
can you turn around?

roger.
okay. time skip
great machine.

how could this goddamn -
burn time is 19 seconds ...
that's affirmative. let me get word on when we expect to go off lm power.
just kick them against each other and - -
*** wheel is full counterclockwise.
come further left. that's a pretty good sized one.
"roger, 11. we reconmend you turn the 02 fans on manually and ensure that the 02 heaters are in the automatic position."
"okay. what's going to happen is: when we do get in attitude, we can bring it back to auto and get it locked up; but we will need the narrow beam."
"how about this one over here, dave? did you check this one?"
"and, guys, a further word here. as you're probably already aware, the short is in what we've been call- ing the do_stream side of that driver solenoid, and it means orly that it's a little bit annoying to have. we can still turn bank a on and off as we want. we might modify a few procedures a little bit, but we haven't lost that bank."
"okay. 05 20 t0 32 i2_p ()kay. we have _m power breakers. 05 'p0 ]1 20 [_p (}kay. itouston, you're looking at it."

okay. we'll get that down to you in just a minute.
"hello, gordy. you with us?"
"roger. guidance says thank you to al. and if - a couple other things here, if one of you guys has a chance, we'd like a mag - magazine status read- out tonight, and we're seeing some noise on dave's biosensors. he might want to check them or push them down a little bit or something."
"columbia, houston. you've got a go."
"apollo 11, houston. could you give us a few com- ments on your crew comfort with the csm hoses moving the air around? over."
"roger. loud and clear, charlie. time skip 421 09 06 35 23 _ and it doesn't look like it took, pete."
"and, tony, the rover tracks are just - we're barely sink - they're barely sinking in!"
"ohhh, boy."
okay. now what's undocking time?
that's a super idea.
roger.
"houston, this is endeavour. be advised falcon's going hi bit rate, we'll give you another call."
"aha!! look at that piece! here, let me get it, john. back up. i'll go get it. there it is right there."

"no, jim, i - i don't know. i think it's a gray. ·.. gray in the albedo. at least, that would be my guess."

507.
that's right ...
yeah.
"super bowl, here they come. watch out now."
"houston, if i take a down-sun, i'll have to stand in front of this contraption. you want me to do that? in front of the camera at 3 feet?"
"okay. as you move off, pete, every once in a while, i can see some white; but, most of the time - hey, you kicked over a rock that had a white bottom - quite a bit different than the top. right behind you; you might - you might want to take a picture of that. it's quite a bit dif- ferent than those others."
that's affirm.
those optics ... are superb.
"okay, charlie 3 and bravo 3 are on. alfa 3, and bravo 3 are off. it should have been charlie 3 and dog b are on."
"okay, my pga is getting down to about usable pressure of 4.3 now. what's yours now?"

wait - you're caught onto here. may be caught on that shelf.
"wait a minute. let's - let me twist it this way to give you a little more room. okay. see that saddle. oh, you'll never get in there with the plss, jim."
"okay, hey, real fine. you know the guys at lunar surface don't even have any zpn, you know. they left it up here."
"when i went through that jettison business, i felt like i was throwing away half the cabin. oh 09 h3 59 cdr-lm mine is 22050, houston."
"hel-_o, houston. how you doing?"
"well, look at this one right here."
... good.
okay. shoot them on down.
"okay, that agrees with - -"
"why don't - why don't we do the tunnel and get that stuff in here. i don't think it's going to be in the way too much, once we get your suit out of the way. oh, do your biomed stuff, and we'll get all the transfer stuff together. then we'll have it all, and we won't have to do any more shuffling."
"good, jim."
okay. that's right. you're getting a radial sample. that's fine. i forgot you were doing that.

"okay. stand by 1, would you, please?"
"okay. we're on the top of 3-28, gordo."
"pick up your rig_ht foot. jack, you're just going to have to get up on that ladder somewhere so i don't - don't get the dust all over this thing."

okay.
yes.
yeah.
my!
what happened to the static? did we lose houston?
"i was just going to say, looking back across serenitatis into the sun now, there must be bessel that has ejecta pattern out there. when you look at the ejecta patterns into the sun, they all look black with respect to the mare. i think it must be a shadow effect or something that you get off of the - the raised ejecta that comes up across it."
"okay, gordy, we're dow//to 0.2 on the delta - i mean, correction 2.0 on the delta-p, and we're starting our leak check."
okay. thank you.
"roger, al. put on our sunday best for you."
"okay. i'm just going to stick these cards here in the compartment then, and - -"
"didn't make it, huh?"
right.
"yes. i think we better leave. you know you don't have to get them all, a1 ...."
that is the way it - -
"a reminder, 17. we'd like to have you leaving here in 30 minutes to make up some of the time we spent at station 6 and 7, a little extra. and we'd also remind you that we'd like a rake soil sample here, too. that may be the only way we try and pick up some stuff other than subfloor if that, indeed, has come down from the top of the sculptured hills."
*** the tv.
(laughter)
"okay; thank you, stu."

if you come - they can't guess what happened. the little thing i didn't - it came unlocked.
"i got big feet today, charlie. 06 01 41 18 ijmp-eva - - like that. uh-uh."

"no. i need a little finesse, though. it's one thing to reach over - here and do this on level ground. i don't know if i can do that without falling on the battery."
what?
"you know, i think you're right. and if you'll just wait until i finish the pan, that's exactly what i'm going to do."
"and, ken, i've got one more flight plan update for you."
"and looking at cone crater, where a1 was looking a short time ago, it doesn't appear there is going to be any trouble getting the met up cone crater."
- - 7-footer in color. okay. i'll go read the temp. you want another picture?
i got it; i got it; i got it.
"15 - apollo 15, houston. that callout at 243:30 --' is the 02 heaters for tank 3, only."
"how about this one, with the inclusion? maybe i can get this one."
okay - without the angle. that's right on.
"yes, that's what i've been doing. see if you can get a bigger -"
"ron, is there a cone associated with f crater?"
"remember where we put it, al?"
"okay. well, just want you to be advised we don't particularly want to start early; and, therefore, you're ahead of the time line right now. you can take a break afterwards maybe."

"oh, the repress 02?"

i didn't have any trouble nulling the velocity.
"roger. you mentioned something in earth orbit that kind of intrigued me. you mentioned seeing the rainbow, and we were trying to figure out how you saw a rainbow up there. and you were in orbit already at that time. do you remember that?"
okay ....
okay; on 11-1.
"and, 15, let's hold a couple of minutes while we check some data on the sim bay and then we'll go to the mocr one more time. and we'll be back with you in final status, i hope."
see how it works this trip.
"that's right. no sweat. john aaron's just saying that they may he hot. he's checking on it, so how about hold?ng a decision on that and let me come back to you?"
okay at 267:00 - 09 19 49 30 cml° go ahead.

"and, dave, if practicable, we'd prefer to have it turned off before or after the tv, because then we can watch it being turned off. otherwise, we can't see it during the tv. but you can certainly turn part of it off before and part after."
understand; they're both plus.
"right. underneath where you just touched, just dig deeper."

go up topside here and photo the other side of it.
"roger. go $head, houston."
"yeah, you're probably right. there was a comment from the apollo 15 crew that the front wheel didn't seem to bother them when they lost a fender up there, but the back wheels seemed to move. i don't understand it, but that's what they said. and that's all i've got if you want to go ahead and - get dressed."
"gordy, if the throttle test looked okay, i'll go engine arm, off."

"okay, 172:29:39.00."
okay.
"falcon, houston. we'd just like to complete down through step i or 2 of configure ags before los. and, endeavour, if you can give us an accept, we'll shoot you an up-link before los."
"roger, john. when y'all get through stowing and cleaning up there, whenever you're ready to pick up in the flight plan, give us a call. we got a little change to that sim bay configuration, and we won't bother you with it now until you're ready for it."
"well, if you could just stretch it around."
okay. drill's off.
okay. bus voltage ...

okay. you've got about 22 minutes left.
"i'm in an area now, houston. it looks like -"
"yes, those are the last two i put in there. they just - your bag is so full they won't stay. let me give them a reading here. hey, bob, can i move it on the rover and then give you a reading?"
"okay, 8000 feet; 27 feet a second."
"is this just for this pass, jim?"
okay. what do you mean?
okay.
how about if i leave the vhf a and b off?
ckay; we'll do that.
"oh, sure. go ahead. i'm just sitting here right now."
"you were going to ,.ake me do that in another 45 minutes anyway_"
"okay, dave. and we got a few updates here for the time after the tv pass, if you're ready to copy. some other stuff that we are moving up because of this."
"hey, jack. i also have some words for you and gene. got some advice from the home front. the thing to do with ron in the future is to hook up a baby ben and a metal dishpan. it works every time, if you want to wake him up."
okay. and - stand by.

no. we have los at 49:52 for ... minutes.
"aquarius, houston. you ready with your g&n dictionary? over."
okay. just be careful of the - let me get up there a little farther. careful of that hatch. getting to look like a regular garbage dump down there.

*** know how to do it.
"houston, we have an awful lot of noise coming up."
"okay. zero, zero - at zero, zero, we're back off."
i think - i think that's what it was.

master arm is on. i've got one good light - system a.
"oh, yes. we need to see if - we can get some of the subfloor. i'm not sure i understand what's happened here, yet. this should have brought up subfloor according to the theory, and it hasn't."
"okay, jim. i heard you say perpendicular to your flight path, which is affirmative, and i didn't get the rest of your statement."
(sound of train)
"okay. do they want it on or off? leave it off, huh?"

"okay. in the inner appearances of picard, for color variations, can you determine different units based on color and flow characteristics? 05 17 49 42 cml° yes, you can. in the area where you have the white thrown out on top, you essentially got a - as - as you go down the crater wall, you've got a white streak that goes all the way around it, and then you've got a dark layer underneath that. and then a white layer on below that."
"okay, ken, we are ready for pan camera power to off at this time."
okay. okay.
"aquarius, houston. ovar."

okay.
"nah, charlie."
"on your side. s-band, pm."
"yeah, that's because my mike's about 25 inches away. how's that?"
"about 1 minute, pete."
okay.
"i know you guys won't believe this, but after spending 3 days among the rocks, ever so often, when we're sitting around in here, we see a pebble go by. and that's the truth. i don't know what we're gonna do with them."
"we might even find some shatter cones. but don't tell anybody. 0dr-eva well, i'll say one thing for old van serg, it's blocky. whoo l"
okay; i'm around.
a-b?
roger. they said that sounds like some of the flight planning that's been going on down here.
that's right on. it's good. that's where it's going - -
"anyway, it's convenient to you."
"oh, no. well, the lmp dozed a couple of times but - i thought i saw one, bob, but i'm not sure. i squinted hard about that time. i may have just triggered something."
give houston a call and give it to them.
"okay, bearing is 358; range is 2.2."
yeah.
"yes, when we get to the rille, we will, joe. can't see the rille at all from here. still looking for - rhysling."
"if you'll recall, that's why we left it in the first place."
"let me just jot that down - 34.9, oxidizer."
"okay. that was some good stuff, ron. just don't hesitate to keep talking on that. we can sort it all out when we get down."
looks like it's going backwards. i don't see any coming up over the top. looks like a good fix.
"okay. you figure it will bc fully charged then, huh?"
"nos it's all - all your stuff's right there, gene."
okay.
"okay. it has some big clasts in it, john. 05 0h 08 13 cdr-eva it sure has."
"thank you, charlie and thank you for all the help."
roger that.
"look at that shatter cone right there, charlie. i'll be darned."
i put in a total of 3.5.
"yes, sir. if you can read it to us. we don't have any books out or anything."
"okay, houston. you have it."
"houston, this is antares. over."
"hey, bob, does it make any difference if your eyes are opened or closed?"
"go s_head, houston."
"stand by 1. that's affirmative. that's affirmative. we want to go ahead and do it now. 08 05 h5 58 cdr got four, open."
better be something right around here.
"okay, i copy that, jack."
"okay, gordy. the west rim of trident, which, by the way, is full of outcropping-looking boulders, is at l0 o'clock."

not a bad - -
"okay, disconnect 0ps hose. l_vp-lm oh boy."

"oops! oops, center engine."
okay. copy.
looks like it's a good thing we had that jack.
yeah. knocked my mode switch up .... and it's all lined up. 06 21 15 37 lmi_-lm it felt like it clicked. it felt like it locked to me.
"okay. here we go, houston, with the cold-fire check. 0kay, you want to go up? t_ cdr okay."
"hello, houston; endeavour."
yes.
"okay, fine. the basic specs there in - are - we're using window 4/dac - d-a-c/18/vhbw-bracket, m-i-r for mirror, pcm pic cable. (ti, 1/1000, infinity), 24 feet per second."
did you get a decent meal?
that's affirm.
"we'll hold the src open. 06 03 14 26 i._p-eva yes, that's right."
"okay, joe. since we're ahead of the time line, can i proceed on and kind of punch off early, or do you want me to punch off at exactly 1 hour?"
"jack, take a breather there. we got an antenna switch coming."
okay. the trim is set.
i'm going to intercom/ptt.
okay.

now i didn't quite have that feeling (laughter).
they are. 06 21 08 15 cdr-_4 disconnect 02 hoses; vhey're already gone. and connect ops 02 hose. okay. the ops 0r hose is on and locked.
turn around.
you got your eye on that one?
"okay, ken. we're gonna lock up the radar on you."

"go ahead, orion."
"take number 4, and change shu - shutter setting to 1/8th."
"okay, they're 36, 26 - -"
"okay. we're in luck, ] got one pad left."
"yes sir, i dusted that a little earlier. okay, it is standby, bob. radiator is up."
"joe, you couldn't be reading our mind more. we were talking about that, and there is a piece of it right outside nv window. i saw it after we got in here. either that or back of a part of a data book or something - i hate like the devil to tear one of those other fenders off. and the reason tape won't stick is that everything's got a fine coating of dust, and the only way i could finally get it to sti_ was to put tape on it - rip the tape off - or take the tape off - which took some of the dust off and then tape would tend to hold it. but it just won't hack it up here."
"... is off. get the - i'm going to leave them just the way they are until we get all the way through the eva, until i get back up here and then i want to take them off."
"you got it, vance?"
"apollo 11, this is houston. i am ready with your tli-plus-90-minute abort pad."
"did you get that, houston? i didn't put it up. thank you. read switch, off; power switches, off."
"houston, hadley base. we're all tucked in. we'll see you in the morning. 04 lb 58 06 cc falcon, houston. did you call?"

"okay, thank you. tape 1_6/_"
okay. photo the tv mirror.
"and, of course, we're going to bring back the docking probe. now, on stowage: the first three items, the tethers and the webbing can go in the temporary stowage bags in the com- mand module. the hasselblad in the isa, which is normal, and your gloves can go in the pga bag, and the probe up underneath the right-hand couch in vhe temporary stowage location."
that's about it for azimuth.
"no, it's aft; that's right. blocked."
"right now, they are anticipating that, by the time of the burn, that transducer will be biased about 15 pounds high."
"roger, dave. how far back from the lip of the rille do you think you're probably standing?"
"right here; cb(16) ecs: suit fan number 2, closed."
"beautiful, bob. we're going to get your picture as you set this time. right out number -"
go ahead.
"dick, check me and a1 bean ..."
"and you're thinking correctly, jim - -"
"no, i'm not warm i'm just - want to hand me that other scb there."
i don't know if ... 08 23 57 13 cml° you ignoring that flight plan?
"okay, we'll get a sicture of it."
yeah.

yes.
i'm coming your way. let's start sampling.
"yo, ho, ho, ho. out it came. go ahead, dave."
"13, houston. it won't do any good to try to power the propellant valves on a and c, so we want you to disable the auto on rcs charlie. and we have a procedure for getting power from the lm we'd like you to copy down."
okay.
where are you?
no.
charlie? 04 23 46 20 lmm-eva what?
okay. we think you need to service it with some jelly or something.
that's okay.
except it looks almost finer.
"and, ron, just for your information, regardless of what we do on that antenna, we won't have any flight plan changes until after 144 hours due to that antenna."
okay.
"roger. we're thinking of that too, and one problem is that the comm is connected securely to the hose, so we've got to get the comm.cable off somehow to get that - so we'll still have comm down here in the lm and you have the hose up there."
"oh, yes. yes. yes. if i wanted to get technical, something's blocking them. that's right."
"bmag, three, to 1/2."
thank you.
"well, so far."

"okay, water & glycol tanks pressure regulator is off."

got it?
"roger. go free, please."
"do you find that the monocular is any good to you, buzz?"
"beautiful! no pipa bias or drift compensation. boy, i hope it stays that way. what do you want, aot?"
good.
"oh, it - it just dropped down."
okay.
"sixteen feet per second. 500 feet, 15 feet per second. it looks good. the fuel is good at 10 percent."
"okay. whoops, that's me dusting. well, i guess i got about - 25, 20, 15 - i guess 13 percent oxygen, 3.8. okay, babe."
"roger. the only this is - if there is any question on cocking, the only thing you have to do there is just pull it down and get the hook ou_ of _he way. do you have any questions on any of that? 03 09 3_ 48 cmp ah, hank, we just ..."
okay. off and running.
"okay, will do."
"let's try it now. if you can speak up, thc back- ground noise has gone down a little bit."
not a bad idea.
okay.
i didn't get mine filed. and this is serious; would you - -
you know that we switched them?
"i never was aware of any temperature, ever; doing the rock boxes or anything. 07 21 22 23 _ now ..."
"okay, endeavour. we're recommending that you go back to free at launch minus i minute. 09 06 35 32 i_p okay; free at launch minus i minute."
"yes. i took it way up there, somewhere."
and mine are locked.
am i really on? cdr-kqa you're high. you're twisted. go away from me one twist.

"well, we got a little bit off jack. the - it starts high in the lmp's window and goes low in the cdr window. oh 10 5] 37 cmp so we've got a little b_t of a wobble on it. of course, the command nodule venting doesn't help, either."
okay.
"ron, you should not see a tape motion light at los here, be - or - flag, because we've got the dump done and rewound ahead of time. they're rewinding it right now."
"no, that's all right."
there we go. that's better. thing cost me 10 minutes!
roger. stand by. we're looking at that.

any good job offer would be better than that. l0 00 43 04 cml° what? running the program? why do you say that?
"okay. we'd like the steerable back again. try pitch of minus 25, and yaw of minus 72."
"and, bob, in case you're interested, there - all through the nightside pass here - there's a - quite a strong - well - stronger than i would have ever expected - horizon glow off to the north. i suspect that, i think gene said a while ago that it's around on his side also. 53 15 cc roger. guys, i've got the word you wanted to hear_ you are go for tli - you're go for the moon."
"bob, that line of clouds i called a fir-tree pat- tern that swings up towards hawaii - hawaii, if you will - has - also has a mushroom pattern on the top. it has the appearance as if two major air masses - one going from west to east and the other form east to west - have converged along that line, and the joint movement of air at the interface being south to north. and up in the area of hawaii, i think, it tends to mushroom so that the pattern then goes back to flow from west to east on the east side and from east to west on the west side."
okay.
"okay. we show that both booms are not fully retracted; however, we do show them past the point where it's safe for an sps burn. so we'd like for you now to take the deploy-retract switches on both of those to off."
roger.
1/25th .... is 1/25th. you're right.

"joe namath tried mightily to lead the jets to the play-offs, but the oakland raiders grounded the jets in the fourth quarter, 24 to 16. i think you have already heard that score. namath passed some more than 400 yards, but he was only able - new york only scored one touchdown. and the last item concerns the houston weather, which is been - there's been two kinds of weather since you all left us: that's cold and light rain and cold and heavy rain, and it's still doing it. fog and drizzly rain are here now, and we're only supposed to get up to the mid-40's and probably down to 32 tonight. over."

"i'm mounting them pretty firmly. hey, houston? as i was working around the handtool carrier a moment ago, the canvas bag came loose. it took me about 2 minutes to put it back together again; it came off the metal sides. and it looks like those clips that hold it on are going to be com- pletely inadequate, and i expect that we're going to have some trouble with it all day today. we ought to think about fixing it before next time."
"and, jack, confirm you have the scissors in the etb. roger. l_p-eva just a second. (laughter) yes, sir. thank you, again."

"okay. 05 15 14 23 i_mp okay, where's the swc bag? 05 15 ih 27 cdr it shot_ld be in the top of the mesa, ed. 05 15 lh 58 cdr also, in the src, we have - 05 15 15 03 i_p this baby won't fit."
"say again, jack. 05 22 33 25 cm_ you have a good bedside manner."
"okay, joe. the covers are open, x-ray is on, and alpha particle coming on now."
"well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. everything up in there looks just fine. (goss ne5 1) tape 36/4"
"hello, houston, this is eagle. how do you read? over."
stand by.
"i tell you, this is dirt, dirt."
roger. copy that.
"well, *** see if i can grab a clean uht to do that."
"yes, sir. that's from me, and i'm going to put foxtrot on the 16."
"if you didn't know better, you'd say that they were bedrock outcrop, but the're just laid in there, i'm sure_ from north ray."
"okay. not very long s:nce they had the switch off on you, anyway."
roger.
"i'm going to give karl about 6 seconds every time,"
"okay. 03 23 26 54 _ we're going to rcs checkout, ken. verb 76."
"okay, 16. let's try to bring the high gain up."
"okay. how much time, houston?"
"okay, that sounds great. let's press on. 05 23 53 49 la{p-eva there's one of those - there's one of those very fresh craters over at ll o'clock ... - -"
yes.
"hey, not bad for a navy pilot."
roger.
"roger. dave, you mean to say that these small bright craters seem to be clearly related to the ejecta blanket. is that correct?"
okay.
"and i won't bother you with those calls anymore, unless you especially want them."
"m,m, me."
"i think the big thing is, though, that each one of these little craters is much light - much more lightly colored. but we're still not - there's no crater in view that does - that has a blocky rim. there's fragmental rims based on, almost certainly, incident rock, but no blocky rims."
"i'm gonna have to drill away from that crater. tony, i'm about 4 or 5 meters away, is that okay? from that crater i described?"
"okay; we're heading, 087. right now, we're heading, 2 - oh, about 250. range, 1.5. boy, look at the fresh blocks atleaclof us."
i'm going to ... okays you want me to - you're not going to ship me a vector?
what time do we ...?
okay.
with the hasselblad? you got the hasselblad over there?
what the hell are they going to give you - a no-go?
doing the suit donnin_ and doffing is the equivalent of wearing out a set of ropes.
good.
... open - -
"okay. i_p-lm okay, going open."
"bob, i'm parked at 026; bearing is 226; distance, 6.6; range, 4.0; amp-hours, 85 and 80; battery is i - i think it's ll5; and motors are all off scale low."
"okay, you got noun 75s down there. 05 23 03 22 i24p ail1right."
trade places with you. i need to go over -
just like in the simulator.
"okay; we had another master alarm, and i just glanced up and it was the main a undervolt light that was on, just for a second."
they must consider that you are the judge of that.
"roger. now under the burn time cold,mu, the first one opposite the 2986, the burn time remains the same. do not change that one. the next one changes -"
purge. 10 04 33 35 r - - at 5500 feet.
yeah. all right. i will when i get here. looks llke it's hung up on something there.
tone and a vent flag.
"look at those clouds. cripe, it looks like we're , right on them."
"well - take one quick peek. lmp-_ i can't - from where i stand, all i can see is dust."
can i get it?
okay. you don't want to go ahead and get started with that?
"first we've heard about it, but we'll do it, i guess. 06 10 18 42 cdr-_ okay. tony, could we beg off on a prd read - -"
"oh my, i sure can. sure a lot of mountains down there. how about that l"
okay. what do you want?
"roger, karl. you have to stand by on that. he's finishing up over in the lm right now."
"boy, that's a beauty."
"intrepid, houston."
"yes, it did .... good ... all that stuff would or - - (whistling)"
"i had to have a urine before i started making the tow - the chow. i have - oh, you dumb - it feels like it put hot water in the orange juice, but it didn't."
okay. we copy that.
"thank you, jack."
"geno, you're 5 by."
"i don't see anything that would indicate that. reinhold is an eratosthenian age crater, as you may recall. it's crossed, very obviously even in this light, by the copernican rays, which is prime - the m_in way we determine the age, other than it doesn't have any r_ys itself. although, on the good photography we now have, we know it has secondary crater patterns around it."
"okay. the white is coarser. 05 08 32 46 i24p-im that's affirmative. it looks - it sort of - i'm not going to say ash flow, but it sure looked like it was coarse, white - let me get a better word. let me think about that one for a description."
turn the camera around there. i wish i could give you -
"okay; and if you're going up the massif, why don't we try and get the rake sample up there now. when you finish these rocks."
right down the rille. any - any sort of blankets around these craters? does it look like volcanic chain there coming out of the rille?
"and, mike, we think these large delta-r's, noun 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before tli since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. over."
five and a half. might as well go first class. might as well. we want to empty it before entry.
roger. apollo ll is ready to copy tli plus 90.
"yes, sir. how do you like mahler from space?"
"15, we don't have tm on you right now.' is the mass spec taken care of?"
and i'll get the rock box out.
"okay, and at 209:03, add - after ""pan camera power"" - add ""v/h override, high altitude."""
"well, that disappeared. get it this way."
i guess so. 04 o1 19 04 _ you want to apologize for our comments on hot mike during that hectic time period?
roger. get you then.
okay.
how's the timing ...
"antares, antares, this is houston calling al. do you read? over."
i'm surprised he didn't get his papers delivered before he came in.
"a few minutes after we started that, we were supposed to be able to open the forward hatch."
... rover ...
"no, we missed it."
- - is to place the suit diverter valve to the i'ullegress position.
affirmative.
"hey, that was a no-sweat. you know that?"
"i think the boulder population is starting te thin, charlie. 06 22 11 27 l_-eva i do too. they're getting smaller, and the cobbles are getting smaller. like we - could be just out of this ray. we don't see any of the - maybe one or two of the half-a-meter-size boulders now, tony."
okay.
"i want to go to po0, okay?"
"oh, i read you loud and clear. you sound beautiful."
i'm going to take it a little slower here in a minute.
okay.
"okay. i'm going to need you to help me get this treadle up to the front, jim."
roger.
"we expect that your water rate is going to drop off and at the time, delta will go up to 160 - 165 hours quite shortly. another thing we're interested in is what's your status on rest and medication."
i can't hold that bomb any longer.
"no, i don't either. 05 _3 00 17 cdr look at that ordeal; it's right on the money."
"okay. well, we'll breathe slowly and save as much as we can."
"i need some more cable there, charlie."
i guess sherlock's going to be right over the top over here. i saw it when we were on that other ridge.
okay. let's see. up there on the rise? be okay?
okay. we got it.
"okay, bob. we got it back. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
stand by.
disregard. (columbia)
you want to do a p20 first.
"okay, so we start with ""maneuver to contamina- tion field photography,"" and we cross out every- thing down to and including ""enable thrusters a3, c4, b3, and d4."""
"okay. the gimbal test option. 03 04 54 41 c¥_ okay, let's let her rip. up 2!. _own 2, zero ...."
...
"okay, on page 17. do the ags load at minus 4 minutes; it's cb(ii), inverter 2, close, and scratch ""select inverter 1."" rate scale changed to ""25 degrees a second."" ""balance couple,"" we'll turn ""off;"" and, incidentally, on the ags dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion we'd had before, charlie, on takeovers. you might discuss what it's going to cost us delta-v- wise, if we get a control problem, to just shut her off and it take 30 ninutes to regroup for a good manual burn."
"well, hello there."
"okay, 0.01."
"okay, hank. i'm ready to copy your erasable up- dates."
we copy that.
roger. go for 7.
"roger, eagle. we gave you a lm state vector. we have not changed the csm state vector, how- ever. over. 04 04 29 40 _ okay. that explains it. over. (eagle )"
yes.
just got the word that they look good for spinup.
"_,fi_atde you need, hank? ch, you want our - }jell, let me find it. i don't _ncw what page that's on fiow. 07 23 08 21 cip, you out them up there, how's the delta-p? 07 23 08 32 c}_' okay. 07 23 08 52 c:,{f here we go, hank. there was minus 0.!, plus 0.002_ elus 0.095. that was torqued at 190:21:00."
"csm/l_ final sep, two, on."
"_ynd,as soon as we get the sextant star check .here on over at 239, we'll go ahead and get vhe dumps out of the way."
"with three guys in here, it fogs the windows up all the time. 08 0i 12 21 cc okay, america. stand by, 5 minutes to challenger impact. 08 0i 12 26 cc _rk. c_ roger; 5 minutes to challenger impact, huh?"
okay. will do.
"b,mmer."
okay.
"dave, we need some help bumping our camera up, please."
"yes. that would be a good mark to give us a range and bearing on, since that's a pretty good straight point."
"the helmet and gloves are in the hatch bag, the great big bag that's underneath the les't-hand couch that you put the hatch in."
okay.
195:17 - i have as the first number on the top of'the page.
"- - and, dave, once you get him started, we can begin with the drill."
"no, i want temp, pressure, ... pressure, and helium tank temp."
okay. pro.
"i got - i think i've been fooled by that, too_ and that's why i estimated the ... time."
"roger. we copy. 03 09 11 07 cml° hank, you really can see both the mass spec and the gamma ray booms deployed."
"yes, you were, and that's one reason you had to copy it down, because we kept losing comm on you. _ lmp yes, as i recall, they seemed to come in batches when - when i was taking notes. is that what you people observe - or recorded, rather?"
- - bad information i gave to you. i guess we'd prefer it away from the rim.
"well, let me read it to you. where is it?"
okay. let's go get the host rock here.
"okay_ that's fine, ron. and, we'd like to get h2 tanks 2 and 3 fans back on. 08 02 57 26 c_ 2 and 3 are on."
"casper, houston. we need barber pole plus three on the camera."
"okay; cabin repress, closed."
"roger, dave. standing by."
"well, that's certainly a possibility. we didn't notice it - looked upright at the time. but it - sure that was the right time?"
"go ahead, columbia."
"in looking at the tv, it appears we'll be leaving the tv off for this, so if you would take the - keep that circuit breaker out and go to s-band mode, pm."
"okay, would you like to hear the contents of this telegram that went out of here today to the u.s.s. ticonderoga?"
"and, aquarius; houston. i've got some circuit breakers you can open to power down displays. in addition, i have a p30 maneuver pad. over."
"actually, on j-3, i took four marks on a crater that was to the west of j-3 and then i finally saw j-3 and started marking on it."
1586.57
"now, how do you read, vance?"
"oh, crap. that's not fair. we're getting here. went and called up a verb - or noun 20, and now i've got to get rid of the son of a bitch. 03 17 50 31 cml_ thought i'd do a verb 37 00. it's going to kill that verb 79 wide dead band i've got going·"
- - ...
"okay, dave. and if that doesn't work right off, we'll ask you to abandon that temporarily and go ahead and deploy the lr cubed."
roger.
"okay, our little helmet bag is beginning to drip, so i guess it probably would be better to trans- fer that into the urine container, right?"
i need your foot on that thing. see if - -
... this book here.
a and b lights are off.
"yes, i'll do that, joe, for sure."
._.
mark.
"roger. you've got it. 09 22 04 b3 cc endeavour, it's your computer. 09 22 04 s7 _ roger."
"yeah, let's look at that one. hold off here ..."
hold it - just a little - just a bit.
"houston, how do you read 177"
"kind of a security blanket effect, huh?"
"okay, trg is out."
"look at the size of those things' _ cdr-eva boy, aren't they big mamoos (laughter)."
i suppose they did.
roger; h2 tank 3 fans going to auto.
okay.
okay. verify the following. check your helmet and visor.
"okay_ i can see lansberg now. and i'm afraid i can't shed any light, pardon the expression, on the old question we've had about the age of lansberg relative to the mare."
next aos 82 32. over.
"okay, 16. go pan cai._era, pot,_jtiorff. 08 09 24 lh ?}p okay. p's2_cyi'.fep_pao_fer's coming ,iff."
"mdc guard, al."
"i'll count down to zero and, say, plus ii then ycu shut it off, then; okay? 03 04 49 57 cn_ don't have to worry about this."
okay. i thought you were going to press on to the north.
the ... short (laughter) scb. okay.
"huh? 07 00 43 42 _mp-eva what am i hung up on, john?"
turn off. potable - -
i lowered this a little bit - is that okay?
it's really good. peaches is one of the best things we have.
"apollo 15, houston through aria number 2. over."
...
"that a boy. okay, let me get a picture. i think the next order of business is that neat one there. 06 01 37 10 ia{p-eva okay, well, there, too - just to the west of you, dave, is some of that - what we've been calling __-_... green material - clearly visible._ see what i mean?"
... think they must be ...
"aquarius, houston. over."
one.
you don't start until you get ...
"and, gene, our only words of wisdom are try to relax the - the eyes a little bit or if you have the blindfold on exceptionally tight, you might work on that. but the - just - i guess sort of relax and see if we can see the other - the other phenomena."
"133, hey."
"roger. 01 1i 14 50 cml° okay, houston, we'll get to the attitude in about another 4 minutes or so. then we'll whip in the p30 and go right into p40. we're doing a waste water dump, urine dump, and - man, the sky is just full of little bitty particles."
"okay, stand by for shutdown; 80, 50 - 07 17 28 57 l_p-lm shutdowi_i"
"and for terminator, but you want to handle the re - retract of the antenna? no, not yet. soon as the - at 48:15, go to pan camera to operate. yes, and then we start retracting hf number 2. oh heck, i cut my finger on the dark slide. boy, that son of a buck. yes. that's right. yes, we'll time it through to start with hf nu_er 2. be 8:15, 47:15_ 47 twice. and, let's see, where does this thing start? 52, i guess. no, 57. 09 15 03 11 c>_ okay, 48:15, stand by. 11, i2, 13, 14 -"
here's the extra ... how about that?
i'd loop around halfway to the south.
okay.
"okay. that's another good one. when you're tired, i'll do that and you can do this. see, this way, i can - you can get a bigger throw. okay. let me know when and i'll do that."
"did you? and then it - when we pitched over, i could see the descent stage like you said."
"there is another one of our blue-gray breccias, i think, over there; recrystallized breccias with scme *** crushed anorthosite in it. i think right in here i'm going to take the pan at about - - cc' and, jack, what's your frame count?"
15. the high gain won't be available to us at the angle 153.
roger.
"jack, do you want me to put this in your bag and start - i'm sorry."
i will. i'll take it right out the front looking right at the thing.
"okay, bob."
okay. stick it in the etb and we'll screw with it later. 05 11 59 lb lmp good idea.
remember?
"well, we will give you some time to think about (tranq) that. 04 ()_ 39 ho cc tranquility base, tiouston. we thought about it; we will support it. you're c_o at that time. over."
that's what i wanted.
okay.
is the rim of spook -
no. no.
"okay. 35915, 10818, 35995."
"roger. 00 00 l_ l0 lmp houston, can you confirm - main bus tie a/c, off?"
"anything over there, jim?"
yes.
okay. we'd like to start with the vhf test when you're ready.
okay.
yeah.
roger. it will be bearing of 100 and range of 4.6.
stand by. that wasn't on my shift.
copy that. what - which one's on top? *** tell?
"casper, houston."
"ail they got is those drinks, charlie. those orange drinks. oh 03 39 57 i_ wait a minute. open the top, john. oh 03 40 01 cdr i don't want to get too close to the hatch."
"we're going to probably stick with the flight plan pretty much. we are going to - i::'- check the lights in the northwest corner of the u.s. (goss net 1) tape 116/2 and southwest corner of canada. if we can see up that high into the northern hemisphere. other than that, we'll be on the flight plan."
"oh, i see."
what he just did.
go ahead.
...
and the sunl
"now, what else did he say about this?"
"11, houston. on your auto rcs select switches, we show quad bravo disabled but quad charlie only partially disabled. charlie 3, i believe, is the only one you have selected off. is that correct?"
"panel 275: cb main b, bat bus b, closed."
yes.
"okay, helmets and gloves, on; cabin repress, closed."
you get there before we do or do we get there be- fore you do?
... confide
okay. 06 00 28 43 iaip-eva let me get a bag; i'll sample the bottom.
okay. rover power is off and our bearing is - -
they do; they look just like granite. here's a beauty over - here's a beauty.
"yes. i've been meaning to tell you about that, yes."
"well, the lm looks nice on the outside. iconfidential 5"
okay; 276.
does that look like the best bet to you? what we're looking for is a primary impact - - 06 01 02 28 i_mp-eva that seems to be about it.
"okay. that gives us approximately 25 minutes at stop g, here. 05 14 15 11 cd5 twenty-five minutes until what?"
"yes, i've got to get the launch checklist. and we're going to go over initial switch configura- tion. and get all those ..."
"it is close - closing, isn't it? 00 03 08 _4 cmp yeah, he is."
how about getting the recorder going there?
"hey, ken. the g&n won't do the gimbal drive right either?"
"ok_, i'll take a pan from here."
oh (laughter).
roger.
"that's a good place for it to be. you have about 30 more seconds, don't you? cml° about 15 more."
we'll be back on occasionally as we get to the mesa. back with you now?
okay. you've got it.
negative. 15. 1 5.
"no, i'll catch one here pretty quick."
"okay, thank you, geno."
"apollo 16, houston. go ahead."
"right. i - the only two i see possible here are bessel e and sulpic - sulpicius gallus, and i guess they might not go that deep even so."
i must have picked his up or something.
"roger. proceed with the logics check, and we're trying to get a go/no go on the jett right now."
"yes, it's in."
"okay, we're in attitude and we're going to give you the steerable."
we have to finish after you.
stand by a second. _
"okay, you're on the tv, jim."
go ahead.
"oh, okay. and that's about 131, huh?"
"yes. they go down in the leb underneath the computer, and the heavier things you have down there increases the l over d. we don't have any srcs, so i was just wondering what heavy things - we could probably put some cameras, television csxaeras, things like that that nor- mally pretty heavy down there in - that, in our src. no, we can't, put the in our src, but we could put them in that container down there which would help decrease our l over d. any- thing else you can think of would be greatly appreciated because we don't even have a throwaway station, so we're down a little bit in l over d. 01j15 34 33 cc okay. let me pass that question along, and get somebody working on it."
"falcon, houston. trim in plane only."
that agrees more or less with the way we read it.
jett.
... - -
"okay, did you get the verb 80 in?"
open.
okay.
"roger, jim; copy."
"ron, noun 26 doesn't require a sign."
it's off. warning tone is on.
"bob, how long have we been driving?"
that's affirmative. both of you.
"110:20 - - 04 13 33 55 l_ so that's 20 minutes plus - just a minute. it's going to be 35 in a minute. so, that would be 25 and 20. 45. put 45 in there. no, no, no, no. i goofed it. put 15 in there. we want it count- ing up. i goofed. thatts it. now i'll tell you when. not - no, no. the time has got to get to 35 something, so it's got to get to $5:37. so i'll watch it. okay?"
you do?
okay.
"hey, stu."
"did you see it, charlie?"
"the note is, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag whiskey whiskey. balance of magazine was used for preflight cal. i'll say again, do not exceed 40 frames on earthshine mag whiskey whiskey."
hold the glove. 04 23 31 51 _ *** you're not in engage position.
"okay, go ahead."
"yes, bob. here's 17. say, for a while here, why don't you guys go ahead and manage the omnis. i think we can get things done a little better; and when it becomes inconvenient for us to switch, we'll let you know."
and any sort of outcrop you see in the south massif.
"and, aquarius, houston. at your convenience, we'd like another volts and amps readout."
cheek. okay.
okay. you're looking good.
"i've got a tone and it's water tone. okay, i'm going to go al%er that hatch. can you slip to the right as far as you can? got it. lmp-lm_ got to hold it until the pressure decreases. all sorts of junk going out there. cdr-_ okay, now. okay. it's pa_ially open."

"no, i don't think it is either. we got a ridge up here in front of us, we'll - -"
you need to be over here.
okay.
okay.
"okay. i killed the jet monitor, and i - i am ready to copy."
"roger. roger. the terminator is going to go right across it on the next pass, right across the eastern edge of eratosthenes."
okay. i'm ready with the camera.
roger. we kind of suspected that.
"no, no. i'm on frame 150. i guess i got enough to cover it."
"okay, casper. i have a - a - a block data pad for you and some flight plan changes."
did it go barber pole when you put it - put it on?
"and, al, any sensation other than just a flash?"
okay. we'll tell him.
"you were - - 03 14 02 05 c_ well, we're going to be just about the same atti- tude. let me see - this is 292. we're about 8 min- utes to the b_rn - something like that .... you want to do ..."
"well, you see, we've overshot that. yaw can go out to 7-1/2 degrees, can't it? yes. huh?"
both of us were dumbheads.
"yes, give me a hasselblad mag ..."
we're quite a ways - we're pretty close to the rim.
"trans control power, on, up; verify."
okay.
please don't sneeze.
"now, verb 49."
"ioming back offl;6.7. 08 23 49 14 _dp okay. watch for a roll. 0_ 23 k9 15 _ ,)kay."

"mark. flash at, seems like it was in both eyes, at about the 7 o'clock position, one-quarter of the way out the periphery, intensity 5."
yeah.
"okay. ia{p-eva okay, mag kilo goes on the 500; is that correct?"
"okay. well. here's a couple that are torn off, you could use. *** one and -"
stay.
"okay, the dsky and ems look good. still in the tight limits."
that the way we lifted off?
"no, not out across the rille."
okay.
sounds good. and tell dave once again that you don't want any dust on your experiments. _.
let me - let me - let me do one - -
okay. frame 61.
"that's affirmative, we completed the _52. we'll give you the data from it in just a second. we passed our sextant star check at e_try attitude, and right now we're maneuvering to our first horizon cheek pitch attitud_ of :98 degrees."
"roger. shield off, now."
"we agree, dave."
got to be.
"hey, i'll be right with you."
"yes. these others all look - you're right, jack, they look like what we've been sampling. and they're all pretty well mantled except the ones you got up there. there's one more piece i see on the side of that crater that may not be. 06 20 17 _ lmp-eva bag 5_5 will be soil from under that anorthosite boulder. bob, the only thing that bothers me about that boulder being subfloor - i mean at sculptured hills - is that it's glass-coated."
"okay, 17 --"
"okay, fine. see you in the morning. thank you."
"where are they, charlie?"
"columbia, houston. r_ger. we copy. and, eagle, looks like the best antenna would be forward for the lm. and, break. eagle, we missed your loading of the tpi tig and p32. could you con- firm you've done that?"
i'm getting them now.
okay.
yes. it's about i meter long and one rake-width wide.
"yes. 06 21 33 3c cc okay, dave. - - 06 21 33 31 i/vip-eva ... you want ...? i should have put this on the lens."
"and is shows we even know how to calculate the burn attitude, cisp yes _ thas _s good .... 07 09 56 36 c},_p okay. we're cmc, rate 2_ here°"
white ring. that's right.
and - about ll minutes and 15 seconds.
"i'm not sure h°w many evas you can get out of a suit like this. 5-222 '_r_,____ l day8"
"we've been going in the right direction all along, then. oh 04 50 32 lmp okay."
okay. that sounds like the title of a book.
"oh, may have thrown it over. may be behind you."
"roger. at the present time, we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book. we are thinking about some and kicking them around, but they're very minor changes. over."
"ail righty. t-start is 121:32:18; t-stop, 122:32:08."
"no .... l0 05 16 b1 cdr 0hh, what did i do with it?"
"hello, endeavour. this is houston in the blind. if you read, go reacq and narrow at angles of pitch, plus 25; and yaw, 185. that's pitch, plus 25; and yaw, 185. over. 05 lb 48 45 cmp hello, houston; this is endeavour. go ahead. 05 lb 48 48 cc okay, al, this is houston. you're loud and clear now. i would like to suggest going to the presleep configuration before you bed down for the night there on the comm. 05 lb 49 03 cmp yes. roger. will do, gordo."

coming up at aos in a moment - at 6 minutes.
"okay, lmp was _ lmp was _ 83 to 70."
"columbia, houston. about 3 minutes to los, and i have your consumables update."
good.
"not anymore he isn't. i took the tv. bob, you still read?"
"okay; 4900, closing at 5."
"go ahead, bob."
roger. understand. 06 05 36 30 cc ...
you know they took the fcsm out.
"okay; let me take another look at the landing site, and then i'll get it. okay?"
"houston, 17. how do you read?"
"why don't we get this big piece of dike now? imp-eva see if you can get - whoa! don't hit it again. there, you've still got some - still got some contact there. d cdr-eva *** some good contact. man, that'll do it."
"roger. roger. and on magazine charlie-char!ie, i show you still have 3 minutes remaining. 04 19 27 04 l_ okay. we'll leave it on there, then."
"16, this is houston. we're showing about 2 min- utes to los, now, if you'll give us a range and range rate, and, ken, perhaps you could repeat it for us."
it's not going in. something hard in there.
"okay, ron, we're within a minute of los. your 02 flow still looks good, and the rest of the stuff that you can get on the vhf is going to be just fine. you're right on schedule now."
roger.
"go ahead, endeavour."
... go for landing.
"aquarius, tlouston."
- - ... eyeballs or whatever they are.
roger.
"}_rk. it's barber pole and running. '.,,__ilie'm here, i'll get vhe gai,£daray shield_ off, and the l_'s_n altimeter, 0i. 07 21 32 09 c_ okay, image motion is set, and ready to copy some - s0._!e flore ."

okay.
"rot control power, two, normal, ac."
"yes, i'm - i'm looking for you. you weren't in the left window; are you in the right window?"
"and, connect plss water hose, verify lock, pls$ diverter valve min, and plss pump. okay?"
"tell you what, i'm getting accustomed to things. f cdr-eva that gate's a little sluggish, too, jack."
"okay, let me get the switches off here - so we don't have anybody drive off with it while we're gone."
yeah. go ahead.
"apollo 16, houston through hawaii. over. 00 02 44 48 _ roger, gordy. you're 5 by, and it's the most spectacular view i've ever seen."
roger. we going back to the alsep area.
... i know what you mean - -
"15, this is houston. could you give us a descrip- tion of any actions you took when you had that electrical glitch?"
"affirm. roger, karl; thank you."
how about that - how about this deal llke we - wonder if that'd put warm air in like we did with our suits? getting around the secondary coolant loops. _ day 8 page 409
"not significantly. i could get down to about (tranq) the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as i would pound it in about as hard as i could do it, and the second one took two hands on the han_ner, and i was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - i think the total depth might haye been about 8 oz 9 inches. but even there, it didn't - for some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. in other words, i'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. it didn't really to me. over."
"rate scale, 25? (t_q)"
"roger. we need a _ status check from both of you, and we're 5 minutes from closeout. all we need is a few grab samples."
go ahead.
that's correct.
"okay, gordo. the coas align is good, and the dap is reset."
"roger. 88 and 8.5. when you're ready, we've got a small flight plan update for you."
"you want me to put some fines in with this, dave?"
"yes, i know that. 06 21 5_ 44 cdr-eva it's been - that has always - that battery's always did that, and you rat - here let -"
twenty-four ... is this here ....
"standby, please."
"oh, okay."
"huh? yeah, that's beautiful. i -"
"- - 31, 32. leave it there; that's good enough."
"how come we pulled them out, then, in this burn?"
"i'll get the tv on. i've already got the battery changed. l_-eva there's the earth right in the middle of the antenna. okay; verify mode 3. i am in mode 3. lcru blankets are open 100 percent. battery covers i'm closing, the battery *** get my antenna. wait a minute. let me set this down."
go ahead.
"go ahead, bob."
"ken, our pitch has got off a little bit. we need about 120 degrees in pitch also."
"tony, read out the eb - etb stuff."
...
"you're going to have to wait, then."
"when we get ready to dock, and the cabin's up to 5 pounds."
and i guess we don't know why that high gain hung up while you were asleep. we're going to just continue trying normal procedures.
... that good old cabin interior.
"what did it - did our reading change much, bob?"
"and one way to locate it, also, is that it should be right on the rim of surveyor crater, and you ought to see surveyor off directly to the north- east."
"i don't know. houston, bow's the cabin - -"
okay.
"got to get this core tube, buddy."
okay. we've got an antenna switch coming here.
"and on level ground, i can skip. i don't like that loping thing."
"hey, houston. you know this attitude - this at- titude has the sun right into window 5. it's probably going to be on the lens of the camera. i'll - i'll try to shade it the best i can, but i don't have an awful lot of hope for these pictures."
"yes_ i still got about 5 on the cabin, i think. _ ... is the tunnel pressure up? c_ i got the hatch out_ yes, it's pressurized. _ okay. just pull it open then."
i can call joe when we up - unload that.
... seconds to go. probably ... and ... 10 seconds.
do we have hawaii all the way through the burn?
yes. 04 23 4h 07 lmp you see what i'm hung up on?
step 11 complete.
"okay, right -"
but i'm not going to throw my yo-yo away. ' nasa _ msc
cdr's ops ... 5800.
"houston, 16. are y'all satisfied with the nitrogen pressures on the sps?"
"okay. on the p27s; 71, 11:45:00; 21, 01501, 00001, 71465, 41437, 76654, 45425, 77003, 52553, 72602, 54007, 75455, 55217, 76267, 55324, 00402, and 05560."
...
"can you stand by l, please, gordo?"
go ahead and turn around - -
"and another thing we're going to photo is the scoop trenches, f:8, 5 feet, at 2."
"okay, no problem. was the - when you went to put the lspe antenna in the heat-flow socket, you didn't have - weren't able to do it at first, was it because of there was a lot of dust in there? lmp-i_4 no, i think it was the same old problem of that piece of - of al_m_num foil or whatever it is going down in the socket and jammtng briefly."
go ahead.
let me get a grip on him now.
wilco.
okay. thank you.
and we would like to do that before we start the uv photography.
okay. i'll be pressurizing.
okay. i didn't read the whole procedure. jim just mentioned he wanted to disable plus-x.
stand by.
"hw_,."
okay.
okay. reset. and then the targot is 134 azimuth and 39 elevation.
"hey, tony? 05 20 g0 29 cc go ahead, john. 05 20 00 b4 cdr-lm did you hear what we said about the uv camera? over. 05 20 00 b9 cc i got about the uv camera, and we got a procedure already that - we'd probably ask you to move it out of the - or back to the north at the end of eva-2. do you think - you don't think it will be in the sun before that, do you? 05 20 o0 55 i_ip-lm it's in the sun right now. the lens ... in the sun."

"oh, okay. sounds good. c_ it's in the volkswagen pocket. okay. 09 ih _o 05 c}p i don't think we ever changed it though. okay_ the arrow's there, which indicates vha_ '_edi_n'l do it. okay, lioh canister change, 19 into a, take 17 and put it into a - a-4. that's correc5. 09 __ __ 17 cmp a3 24, we want the pan camera."
"houston, eagle. ed battery a is 37.0 and battery b is 36.9. over."
"i'm gonna do that next, and then i'll get this stuff. i'll do it."
okay. what do you want done to the sep?
"okay. set norrmon flag, verb 25 noun 07 enter, 101 enter, 10 enter, 01 enter. rendezvous radar mode to lgc."
"okay. yes, that mushroom pattern we've been talking about, on either edge - either end of the cap - and the mushroom points north - is a major cyclone cir- culation system. and also taking - moving, in one case - or trending, in one case, to the northwest and the other to the northeast, there are linear cloud patterns. gives it a very symmetrical and a striking appearance. i hope it shows on those pictures."
"probably down below him. below us, rather. hey, ken, they want you to rendezvous at 100 hours, whenever that is."
stand by. i'll ask. we'll get it for you momentarily.
roger.
we need a grotlnding wire for this thing ... any wa[r. we used to have ...
don't let me forget to bring a dustbrush back when i come. i know it's in my checklist.
"i'm afraid they're moved a little bit. i/_p-eva oh, i can't - that's it. i got a few pictures looking up the boulder track and then off to the right - to the left a little bit - and one off to the right. and i think - i'm not sure how well ·they overlap; that's just an awful hard shot."
"... the old purge valve, valve 208. it came from the taurus-littrow landing area of the moon. okay. got the purge valve. boy. okay, just looking at some ... (laughter) okay. it's low, is it?"
"well, it's obvious i was t,lking about the - the landing day."
roger.
it worked. it worked.

"well, let's - i'm turned around, why i took the shade off my side first."
"yes, that's right. okay."
we don't have your time. you screwed that up.
"roger. we haven't quite got that before the 50 000 000 tv audience, yet."
"okay, houston. i skipped a step on the lunar bat off/reset. i'11 go back. 04 l0 29 58 cml° okay, houston, i forgot to release the docking latches. okay. i'll go up and release docking latches i and 7."

"oh, did it ever!"
"to the west of - yes, east of triplet. excuse me."
i'm transmitting on b and receiving on a.
i think it was just the second one on the fan.
"yeah, i agree."
"apollo 15, this is houston. how do you read? l0 05 17 39 cml° hello, houston; this is 15. loud and clear, and i got your first message, karl. i'm sorry."
roger.
"in, babe. oh 18 55 17 cdr okay. thank you. hang on to your water hose, here. no, your right hand, that a boy. okay?"
i'll get behind my - to the hatch.
"and, 15, it's your computer again."
the horizon is about one quarter of the way up. beautiful.
"oh, good show. okay, in the g&c checklist, per- form steps i through 4. after the rates are damped in step 5 under the ""auto rcs select,"" use b/d roll and d3, d4, c3, c4 jets. and you might just sort of write this in at the side - not cross anything out because lateron you'll go back to the normal procedure."
"yeah, sure did. i'm sorry, i just read you the gainstep line. yes, i'll leave the mass spec out."
"okay. suit gas diverter, pull-egress; verify? 04 l0 37 27 lmp-i_ verified."

that's affirm.

"okay, 158."
negative. coming unstowed.
here we go.
"taking three up this time, jim? _--_"
roger. is your ranging on?
how can there be orange soil on the moon?
...
"yes, and then north of that is - yes, okay. but in the case of marginis - there's a brand new crater just in the northeast quarter of it - i mean r_orthwest quarter."
okay. need another bag. let's dump it in a garbage bag.
"no, that's mine."
"you have to go anywhere else, now?"
we had s-band acquisition and s-band high gain.
it's going in.
"yes, sir; exactly. now the next line should read ""sps injection valves, two, open."""
we're about halfway across the pacific.
"the covering on the - on the service module, if it hadn't been covered, boy, that would have been burned and scarred and scorched and everything else."
"roger, jack."
roger.
"roger, jack. we're standing by."
"you even sound better. battery covers are smful dirty, but i will not dust them as long as you're happy."
watch your - you got a hole in front of you.
"boy, i can't see my camera setting, it's so full of dust."
"let's see. if you're going to do that, hand me the checklist - -"
okay. we're coming down.
you have 10 percent waste water now. you can terminate the dump.
"hello, houston; 12. read you loud and clear. how me? time skip"
*** some water?
copy that. beautiful. remember the charge goes off at 0.6.
yes.
go ahead.
"i don't mind pitch, but i sure don't like roll."
"roger, jack. understand you dropped a couple of the antenna reels."
i got bags.
"yes. well, let me pick a random number and see if it will count from there. i just tried to tell you the correct times - -"
mark cdr.
roger. we copy.
that's affirm_ i don't know if you guys can see it out the one window or not -
"henry, can i assume that the mission timer is in sufficient sync and that we don't need to do any updates there and that the refsmmat is good as is?"
roger. those automatic devices fail us every now and then.
"america, houston. we're observing cmc in free instead of going through the p20. we wonder if you accidentally hit a switch."
"okay, we're ready for dps press."
"oh, there's a place to stow it. we just don't have the big rock bag out."
"ken, i've got some words on the sim bay status, if you want to listen."
"roger. delete the mass spec and ion source, off, and configure for urine dump."
"yes. just beautiful for us, ought to be a go."
"hey, gordie. in honor of one of your comm handovers last night, and in the tradition of apollo 8, i've got paraphrase of a familiar poem for you."

...
"i'll tell you one thing, ...... i can't believe it."
"no. what's the radiator outlet temperature? 25 - no, they're not on."
"sorry about that, dave. when you complete this maneuver, they're in your flight plan, fitch, minus 22; yaw, 227."
that's what i've got. i'm watching for them to come up on the - on the horizon and see earthrise.
beautiful - don't want to go hungry.
"yes. and i got a little frag. don't drop it. there. and i got some green, and i got a frag out of the breccia."
okay; now.
"you know the - you can't see into camelot, jack; that rim is - is camelot out in front of us."
the descent handle - the descent handle is out in the sun. 06 19 _9 48 cc ()kay. i guess we'll probably have to slide that back into the shade again. 06 19 _9 57 cdr-lm yeah.
i don't know - i don't know if you should close them.
"apollo 11, houston. we swapped antennas on you again. i say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. we're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the mocr. over."
"yes. yes, come back."
"okay, jack. that's really fighting it pretty hard. we'd like you to put the uht in the socket, and rock it very firmly. don't pick it up, but rock it very firmly from side to side in all four directions - move the uht about 6 inches in each direction while you're doing it."
... okay.
"oh, well."
"okay. sorry i couldn't get it all the way in, · because that sure isn't very far. bravo 9."
okay. we've got a picture now.
"okay. 06 o0 34 23 i_p-eva okay, that one bottmed out now."
yes.
"joe, how do you read me in the lm?"
...
"yes, that's affirm, bob. i think what i'll do, i'll wear it as a bump hat, you know, and then - and then use the lightweight headset with the - you know, with the earplugs underneath that. i'll put the lightweight headset around my neck, and then have the mike sticking up in front of me, and with the earplugs on. i - i tested that configuration; it's comfortable. no problem. it'll work. and i will not plug in the c_mn carrier at all."
"okay, ... 04 01 20 05 i24p houston, aquarius. how do you read?"
"good readback, ken."
"i got to get some regular pictures on this set. okay. here's the - if that one won't come off, this one will. got it? 06 19 _0 38 lmp-eva and - yes. 561. that's a sample of the gray, looks like recrystallized breccia that the dikes are continuous with."
mark at 174:57:52.
"ken, you _::on'vreally need to copy much, i think. if'you've got the camera handy there wlnere you can look at il _ i can give it to you in a few words."
"houston, apollo 11. go. 01 1i 17 53 cc roger, mike. would you please copy down your verb 16 noun 20 icdu angles now, then execute a verb 49 and load that - those angles, the noun 20 (goss ne_ 1) tape 23/5 that you see on the dsky into the verb - into the noun 22 slot; and pro on that, and that will start our 20-minute rate period. over."
"that's affirmative. and immediately following that, we want to go to the csm experiment/eva checklist, gum nebula photo sequence b, page x/2-8. 05 21 47 0b cml° okay. and then we do - get ready for the gum nebula sequence b on page x/2-8."
...
"i couldn't even read the pan - the panels. hell, i said everything's on, a1 - - 00 02 10 50 _ you know one of my first - -"
lot it.
"stand by, ken. 04 04 08 24 i24p-lm houston, orion."
(laughter) i believe you.
yes.
- - and east of serenitatis.
"read you loud and clear, ed. i'm ready for that update now."
"okay, i was just doing some isometrics. i was tired running in place again then."
"fifty-cent piece, yeah."
"okay, hold it there. okay."
"huh? both of them, you mean?"
"and, jack, i presume when i told you, you turned off the receiver, didn't you? not just the dsea? lmfp-eva that's affirm. i turned off both switches."
"okay, john. we got - both of us got bags on our backs, so why don't we just take these litvle bags."
yes. yes. about half a second out - - ok 13 19 54 lmp - - let's do that. give me the dps card again. deca gimbal ac.
"i don't know if that tape is going to hold. okay, on and on. okay, it's taped down more or less."
okay. give me one gnomon and my shovel. 05 13 09 20 _p here's your shovel.
go ahead.
"copy it down. tap_' 30/1 i'ag,'it%',"
at 151?
"about - now about 20 seconds, maybe 30."
say again? roger; we copy.
"13, houston."
"okay, that's plus 2.68, plus 109.19, plus 5.03."
yeah.
"hello, robert. you gave us an extra half hour."
okay.
"okay, jim. we'd like you to get some pictures, but we want you to conserve rcs. don't make unnecessary maneuvers."
*_* we're through with that card. 0h 11 50 42 lmp okay.
1/250th at 7 feet. i don't know why it's 7 feet. six frames a second.
"yes, that'd probably be best - because i think that's probably - let's see, range .7 - that's still not rhysling. shouldn't be."
yes.
trip it off what?
that one just didn't want to work any more.
"okay, *** stowed."
yes.
it's okay.
thank you.
"jack, houston. we show you down here 121 thou- sand miles 520 out. so i guess we all agree."
loud and clear.
"roger. we - we don't see anything out there any- more in the way of particles leaving the space- craft. we'd suggest, maybe you zoom the moon in a little bit again so we can see the shape of it better."
"oh, i'll get you that, joe."
"okay, i thought there was a p52 or something i was supposed to get as soon as it got dark. i'll - i can sneak that in there, too. i hate to see us miss very much of the things that we almost did."
"roger. on that 20 flc'wtransducer town here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pi_et_y well with what you read out onboard, and the eecomm's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than waat we would expect. we're still working on the prcolem, and we'll let you have a fore complete diagnosis on it in a little while."
minus 6 minutes.
"17, are you receiving houston now?"
*** is already prepared. and drink and position mikes.
"i'm sorry. i didn't - i don't think it needs copying, but we'd like all three of you - when you go into the doffing phase here, we'd like all three of you to pull off the impedance pneumograms. those are the two respiration sensors back on your kidneys there. pull them off, and let any - let any trapped air get out, and then reseal them and give us a couple of minutes of read-out down here to see if that improves the situation."
that came off.

"you're loud and clear now, and let's go to panel 5. we want fuel cell pump ac 1, off; ac 2, off; and that's the fuel cell 1 pump, ac 1, off; fuel cell 2 pumps, ac 2, 0ff; fuel cell b pumps, ac 2, 0ff; g/n power, off, and both the main bus ties off. over."
"there is a general streaking - radial streaking - within that arcuate dark area that radiates radially from the crater, and if i had to project, the dark area would, - north - whose northeast terminus is the arc in the crater, i'd project it off to southeast about crater diameter and a half, maybe. now there's - i'm getting - essentially directly overhead, and again the dark spots within the crater wall are still apparent, and the stre-_iug or the radial elongation of these spots is clear. now, on the lower wall - that's below the first bench - i can see four of these dark areas, and on the next wall above that, above the first bench, there are two - two obvious ones and a couple that are somewhat more subtle."
sounds better than what i had. tape86b/2 cnp it's really not bad. cocoa and orange juice along with it. even have four toasted bread cubes.
okay.
"while you're thinking, i'll put it on mv floor pan, i guess. okay. what do i have to do here?"
"well, yes."
stand by.

passed over target 1.
"okay. aridbefore you go ahead with this, let's establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that. and then as we go through the procedure we want you to wait when you get power on main b so we cart take a look at main b without any loads on it before we start charging the batteries."
"roger. hey, jack, i got some answers to your question from last night on where little america is with respect to - on antarctica."
roger.
yes.
"okay, we - next is the console."
huh?
"fred, it looks good, but they haven't had a chance to evaluate everything. they'll probably be finished with looking at strip charts in about 15 minutes, and after that we'll try to get back with you."
okay.
"that's all right. we got a flag on the rover, and i'm reading 136 on battery number 2."
... - -
"no, ii'you've got something in the right-hand column for all of t_ose, we don't want to have to do it. and now one more thing i owe you is how to ul_transfer lm power to the csm, and i'll get that [_oryou in a jiffy."

okay.
okay. i'm going to take a - a closeup stereo on that contact.
"yes, let's - can you swing a little bit to the right?"
"that makes two of us. white just said; ""that makes three of us.fi i_mp what are you trying to tell me?"
... that thing somewhere.
"roger. no rush on that, charlie. just whenever you work it in."
"yes, same here. okay. now, let me put the covers down on it."
"endeavour, this is houston requesting po0 and accept, and we'll give you a state vector and some drift terms."
"any time you want them, i can start them."
"gdc seems pretty good, let's recheck it here. okay, gdc is realigned."
"you've really got us puzzled with this _ndervol_ now, because the pan camera runs off from main a, 03 09 ll 44 cml° yeah, we'd noticed the same thing. it - you kno_ it may not be rational, but it just seemed like that was the - i touched one switch and got a main undervolt so i took i_ back off again. d_m _ to even let you think about it before i ... any~ mom e. 03 09 11 52 i24p possible that it doesn't have any connection."

so what's new?
understand.
"that's right, jim. it would be good to see what you are doing down in the leb or the far corner of the spacecraft where the optics are. might be interesting to describe what you will do in the next few minutes in the way of sighting."

okay. we're coming up on 3 minutes. i'll give you a mark.
yes. __ day 4 page 141
roger. thank you.
"roger, cdr. it's almost a tossup, but we would like to have the other man out on - with an absolutely good headset, although we don't think it's a real problem one way or another."
"bob, you got the high gain?"
"you can turn your plss 02 off any time. let me know when. can you reach it? if you can't, i'll get it for you."

"no, i'm not. you know, i - and there's - i even threw out where that time is to sit down and take an hour and get reaay for tei. and i'm ready to tell them to delay it a rev, if they don't give us one. i just can't seem to do a tei in a - hurry with a whole lot of things dangling. 08 00 02 31 i_p yeah, you can come over here and cut this cord, john."
yes.
"i haven't detected any, dave."
"i concur. what i'm going to do is get roll to zero and i'm trying to bring yaw into zero and as soon as i get those two pretty well matched up, then i'm going to take the pitch and try to pitch it down."
"okay. i think i said north and as i look at the map -the orange distribution goes generally about a - a crater diameter to the north, but it essenti- ally starts - well, if you'd cut a - on a 60-degree angle - from dog sierra at 63 - cut a 60-degree angle there and then - and then make that go around - out about a crater diameter."
"it's connected and it's locked. okay, dave, to l - low."
roger. we'll do our best.
"okay. third questicm. did the talkback change state after approximately 3 minutes, or was it a half barber pole all the time during the retraction? 06 09 26 31 c_ well i can't answer that one, specifically, since i didn't sit there mad watch the barber pole all the time."
"look at those other fenders, talk about warping."
okay.
"i saw one thing that was - that was new about the zodiacal-light world. you don't realize that that stuff is actually reasonably bright until - you get yourself well dark-adopted then you sit up there long enough to recognize it. but almost - almost immediately after - oh, i'd say within - certainly within 5 minutes and maybe a little sooner after los, there was enough zodiacal light or solar corona - whichever is the proper technical name - that you could see a distinct horizon. and it just got more distinct right up until sunrise. i never did see any prominences or anything like that. i kind of thought that maybe we would, but i guess those are too small a scale. but, just prior to sunrise, you see a lot of long streaks and that's - well, i say just prior - that's like just a few seconds before sunrise. all of a sudden, you get these very prominent rays coming out and then the sun's right there. you don't want to be looking at that."
"okay. 111:57:30.09; plus 0070.5, plus all zeros, minus four zeros 5."
okay. we'll leave that in your care.
"fred, you'll have to say again. can't read you there. there's too much background noise. maybe we need a new antenna."
okay. would you believe that we have a correc- tion now to the last camera i gave you? correct that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.

okay. they said the chamber data is what got them looking at the possibility of doing this.
"okay. power, on."
and overhead - forward dump valve to open.
i hope so.
"okay, and when you're over at the s-band, we have a couple of more pictures of that one."
"no, it's not there; it's under my seat. excuse me. 06 01 46 ]5 cdr-eva okay."
"okay, let's - jim. hold on a minute there. let's - i'm not sure the telescoping rods are disconnected. let's pick it up and move it back and turn it around. okay?"

"okay, and i copy - okay, torque to 279 will be the heading - 279."

"ken, are we pretty close to being at the undocking attitude? 03 22 22 02 cml° undocking attitude is 0, 104, 0."
i don't see it. okay. tightened it up to some extent ... this screwdriver. why don't we try them out. ·08 02 19 42 lmp tool e fit in this socket over here? it's too big?
"yes, i don't either, tony. we'd get the dust from the front fender, then, probably."
huh-uh.
that's affirmative.

"okay, 4 2. thank you."

okay. auto transfer_ open.

okay. we'll tell him. you wanted to be reminded about helmets and gloves as you take your shots of ingenuity on this time. what the hell does that mean?
"°.. guess i ought to pull :.%yradar breakers, now that it's stowed. cm2 okay, houston, can you see my logic ye__. or you w_nt to wait until the high gain? this is america."
roger.
what ...?
"ron, we're analyzing the data on the antenna that - we're 1 second out of the tolerance that stan had established for determining it to end."
"15, does it look like you're going to clear the mountain range ahead?"
"we're auto. at 8:58, plus-x _hrust and zero - 56, 57, 58."
"oh, why did i do that? i_p-eva hey, bob, you think that glass sample would be better off in the src?"
"we'd like to have you turn the optics power off until you need them again, and we would like to have you check the rcs ring 1 and 2 temps for us. over."
"okay; that's those biggies that we see on the left, huh?"
"troops, while you're in a listen mood up there, we're going to be coming at you with a n_mber of items here, not too many, but the first will be some surface block data. then we're going to read up to you a leva cleaning procedure which is fairly simple, a real short geology debrief, a one-line change in the lunar surface checklist. and then, we've been doing some thinking down here about how to fix the fender. and it's going to involve, we think, although we'll work on it while you guys are getting some rest, it's going to involve using utility clamps, from inside your lm there, instead of tape, to fasten some sort of stiff material onto the rover in place of the missing fender. and we'll go with either with one of your - your cue cards, or possibly with part of insulation that, was the flame blanket protecting the rover during the landing. or perhaps part of the packing material that was between the rover wheel and is probably lying on the ground underneath the lm there."
"you gonna put that back to auto before we get out, charlie?"
yes. i'm in good shape. i see it. *** it.
"okay. oh, that doggoned thing's not going to - that tape is full of dust now. okay. wait a minute, jack."
okay.
what?
"say again, charlie. you're very garbled."
okay. go ahead.
unbelievable.
"stand by. you're about - between 35 and 40 minutes. and part of the problem is that we're a little short on oxygen on gene's plss. it looks like it's a 6 minute and 4 - 6 hours and 45 minute eva from that point of view, which means that we have to - we'd have to leave station i too early, which is another - which is the reason to curtail station 1 apart from just behind which is what the hooker was."
visor is down.
"we're about - my time, 3 seconds."

"hello, houston; apollo 12."
"well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here."
"ken, is it convenient for somebody to start a verb 49 to the thermal attitude?"
i think i'm going to - move downslope a little bit.

"al, verify feedwater's on."

"before you go out though, let me turn around so i can watch you."
"i didn't read you at all, jack. didn't read you."
go ahead.
"the terrain gets a lot more locally hummocky with some - with some well-rounded rims but very - very large-aspect-ratio craters, which you got to get around in here - in the 4- or 5-meter size."
"huh? well, that's as good a place as any right n o1_."
are you going to do it?
"just a second, let me find it here. it's presently off, right?"
... minimum. (tranq)
"yes, i'll help him."
"that's affirm. matter of fact, jack has a list- ing of your pads there, fred-o, so you can re- view them after this is over."
... you look great - -
"okay. can you give me some of these photo pads so i can get them going, because this time after jettison is going to be pretty crowded, too?"
"stuart, when you're through with your maneuver, let me know, please, and i'll go ahead with my check."

"- - about 5 or 6 minutes. 05 07 40 47 _mp yeah, i tell you. all those hours we spent looking over these things so you can recognize them without the map have sure been a big help. you can just look out there and generally know about where you are. except there's places here on the back side where i still have to get my map out in order to sort out what i'm looking at. it does look an awful lot alike in places, yet you look down in it and i think the only reason that everything here looks alike is it's just like everything back here has been dusted with something."
where are you?
go to ar. 05 22 l0 35 cdr-dm go to ar.
that is locked in the lock lock.
"and, dave and jim, while you're doing the dusting there, did you get a check on the lrv mirrors for us? if so, i must not have copied."
0kmy.
then close.
"don, we have another 4 minutes before we take our last sequence of photos here, and you don't want to take a water dump until we get through with that, do you?"

"just go back and sample. we'd like big boulder samples, and look for that - well, i guess, we're just boulder sampling now."
"jack, houston. the c0_ gob real noisy there, and i didn't copy that_ stand by a moment."
"okay, joe. one thing i've noticed, that a couple of circuits there now - the pulse ... - at least the number of them, is markedly de- creased, and ... rather bad and, apparently, that added venting we had out of the service module was some overboard relief valve, maybe letting go, because it appears to have stopped now."
okay. have a nice night.
"houston, the integration should all be done."
"roger. copied. plus 04200. it's 21 69. it's in, babe. okay - -"

"okay. roger. you can use that as background for the p52, i guess. president nixon in effect declared u.s. responsibility for offensive ground- combat operations in vietnam at sm end. with the draft still in limbo, selective service went ahead today with the lottery to determine the order in which next year's 19-year-olds will face military service. secretary of state william p. rogers plans to go to the united nat - nations to push for a more energetic international relief effort for east pakistan today. the senate armed services commlttee completed action on a 21 billion dollar military buying bill that meets most nixon admin- istration weapons requests. president nixon and his f,m_ly will fly to manchester, new hampshire, and then to a private island in maine this weekend, when visits to new hampshire also are planned by four democratic presidential hopefuls and republican challenger rep - paul n. mcclosky, jr. predicted weather for recovery day is 2000 feet scattered, l0 miles vis, and waves approaching 6 feet. wind is north by northeast, 18 knots. i have a long list of baseball scores here, which i think i'll just glance over. in the american league, new york beat cleveland 7 to 3. i've had a local request for the dodgers, who lost to the astros 2 to 0. the american classic golf tournament starts today at the firestone country club in akron, ohio. and the win- ner will get $30 000 dollars. sounds to me like the pay's pretty good, and i expect the hours are short. the u.s. pan american team went on a fantastic gold _ medal spree yesterday, winning 17 - rather 16 of the 17 medals at stake. the only one the americans escaped getting was a gold medal in weight lifting. and the total in the games, which are being held in colombia, is 78 for the united states, 36 of them gold, and 51 for cuba, 12 of them are gold. and i'll end with a story comparable only to that incredible contest between the apollo 15 all stars and the north american rockets. last night in the texas league, 21-year-old right-hander tom walker, pitching for dallas-fort worth team, pitched a 15-inning, no-run, no-hit game against albuquerque. he retired the last 21 men in a row. only four albuquerque players got on base, and all of them were on walks. walker got the first 18 batters out before he walked the first one. he threw 153 pitches in the game, and the no-hitter is an all- time record in the texas league and may very well be an alltime record in major league baseball. walker's manager told him that if he did not win the game by the end of 15th inning, he was going to have to pull him out. walker said his arm felt a little tired, but he felt okay, understandably. like doing three evas i expect. and that's all the news for - for this morning. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"

okay.
"roger, pete. the way things are looking right now, you're going to be starting pdi about - about 5 miles north of track; and, during the descent, you are going to be steering south."
"01d al, he's a gentleman ..."
"okay. we copy that. and on the boulders you are looking at now that you think might be thrown in, you might talk about the - the fillet size away and towards the crater and see if that corresponds with the secondary."
is that right? ...
good show.

"okay; i'm halfway, and i'll go back first. why don't you stay there, jim?"
that's affirm. bringing her back down.
"okay, mighty fine."
and we're still 150 miles away or something.
"*** ...? hey, you got your corem?"
yes.
"okay, yes, that'll be good."
"*** to do it. we'll do a p76 after you finish your verb and - and a verb 83 and get a radar lock, if that'll be all right."
"that's correct, jim. and the next change is - it's a deletion at 218:02, and that is delete the ""pcm cable"" line, there. and down a couple of inches, at 218:08, an addition: ""map camera and laser experiment covers to open, and extend map camera."" read back."
"al, we haven't seen any change at all. why don't you go and take and put your glove in front of the lens, but not over it, to see whether we can get any change at all."
did you give me a mark when you started or a mark when you passed the antenna?
"well, karl, does your telemetry tell you it's on or off now?"
"we're now getting a view of - on the horizon, and there's crisium. way up north there, chariie."

"okay; and, 17, when you get moving - when you get moving we want to get, and i quote, a maximum variety of hand samples with a minimum amount of documentation, in a minimum amount of time at station 7. it's just an attempt to see what kind of variety we can get along the face of the front. over."
and -
"well, it's nice to be outside where you can stretch a little bit."
bag's full. all right.
"okay. what did i have there, as a note? oh, that's - yes - -"

"and i checked out the little whistle, and it works like a charm."
"okay. no. uh-uh, sir."
"okay. okay, i've got my grip here, dave. we'll turn it -"
"okay. well that was indeed a sm_ll crater, so i guess the question was right. 05 0b 57 59 cc let me change the mode here and ask you three or four simple _lqep questions again, to verify for various people, exactly what happened. just to make sure that they're clear on it. when - jack, when you were laying out the geophone leads, you mentioned and asked me if it was all right if the geophone leads crossed one another, if there was emi problems. and so that made people wonder whether or not it was possible the geophone positions were reversed; i.e., geophone i was laid out in geophone 2s' direction, et cetera."
"okay, i have the treadle, stems, and i'm - heading back."
no. yeah. here you go.
"okay, burn status: delta-tig was zero, burn time was 2 plus 30. pad angles: delta v gx after trim was 0.1, vgy 0.9, vgz 0.1. delta-v c minu_ 17.9, fuel 10.6, ox 10.4, unbalance minu_ 50."
copy 1.9. thank you.
"okay, fine. next line down, that ""ecs for sleep"" - we'll go cabin gas return to open again, deke."
every time i try to - i can't take that doggone roll out. i got to wait until they get around to the bellyband.
i got the reticle ...
"roger. we're continuing to drift. okay, get your ttcas to roll."
"roger, ken. i'll wait until you get through with your integrity check. give me a call when you're through, please."
"well, i tell you gene, i think the next genera- tion ought to accept this as a challenge."
"16, housten. can you - could you give us auto on the high gain?"
we're getting them in.
okay.

"gosh, the dirtiest checklist in the world (laughter)."
"apollo 13, houston. your preliminary orbit down here is 102.5 times 100.3, and everything is looking good."
"yes, we'll get some. get it?"
okay. go ahead.
"well, we're about on in roll, and pitch, we've got - oh, a couple of degrees to go."
"_ouston, roger that."
"the blocks about a meter or so and the crater is probably about 15 meters, like it might have exca- vated or been a secondary, huh?"
"and, houston; america. i am ready to copy."
"ah - what kind of camera is it? what kind of camera you got? yes, sir. sure do."
"gordy, you got any words on the sim bay prior to going into ptc?"
"must have been too cold, huh?"
"man, we got the world's two biggest trash cans you've ever seen."
very good. glad to hear it.
... tv picture is ...
"okay, i'll turn my flow off here a little bit to keep the cabin from going up so far."
okay.
"okay, t_der ""ivt to csm,"" delete step 2, and prior to ""lm to cm transfer list,"" add ""perform final deactivation per contingency checklist, page 3-12 to 3-15."" over. 07 09 50 55 lm2° okay, on ""ivt to csm,"" delete step 2. perform final deactivation per 3-12 to 15 in contingency checklist."
"good readback, ron. but i didn't catch your readback on the roll. 182 is the roll, 182. did you read that?"
"tony, that panel that shredded - the ones we were telling you about are - have some more pronounced wrinkle ridges in them than any of the other panels."
roger. that was 31 on the end. 03 05 38 50 cml° okay. 03 06 03 -- begin lunar rev 2
be right with you.
"snaps, snaps, snaps; the whole world is held together with snaps!"
"okay, i'm with you. just to make sure we have p47 running."
"is it under the seat? i think it's under the seat, and i think it's the bag for the next eva. keep it there."
i would be interested in what our eva is gonna look like for tomorrow. maybe i was off coremwhen you told charlie or something.
huh?
"ok_ r, i'll get the flag."
and ed fendell is hard on my back to remind you that it's better to be too far s_ay than too close.
yes.
okay. this'll finish you off.
"okay, bob. i'm setting looking right at the sur- face with the optics in this attitude. give me a good roll angle to go to."
"okay, ed; if you think we can't get there for the p24s."
"houston, 15."
"houston, endeavour. go ahead."
"at 273:15 - excuse me; i may have - i read it to you wrong, ken. we want to go to the cyg x-1 point per the flight plan."
i'll get it. you'll get your hands dirty.
"unstow 70-millimeter film bag, top left of right- hand side stowage. unstow 16-millimeter bag; remove 1 mag; stow bag top right of left-hand side stowage compartment. install 16-millimeter magazine cdx, f:ll, 250, 7, six frames per second. put up snap straps, we've done' right?"
"and, dave, - -"
got it. *** should be in aux now.
we'll give it a go.
"yes, they - they were really in their element last night. about 30 seconds to t-start time. i'll let you call it yourself, though."
is it in there?
"okay, tony, number 2 has reached the end again. i'm going to reverse it for the iast time."
i just ... how about turning your ...?
i believe it.
that's affirm.
go right ahead.
okay. the burn is on time and - au - auto shutdown.
"okay, delete the logic sequence check at minus 2 hours there."
"1, 2."
i'll count you down from 10.
it looks like it's a shadow. coming around to - back that way - -
"and, apollo 16, we've got all we need for the night. why don't you press on through there and thsn, your presleep, just record the read-outs. doa't bother sending them down, and we won't bother you anymore. just hit the sack. see you in the morning. 07 13 35 hl cmp roger. as the sun sinks slowly in the west, we bid a fond farewell to all mcc."
"okay, bob. we're 083, 4.4, and 3.8; and i've been running about 20 to 25 amps, i think, on both."
- - we might as well get the rake at the old double core.
roger.
roger; copy.
"roger. well, when it was retracted, you wouldn't be able to see it; that's what i'm asking. is it possible for you to take a look now and see if it slowly comes into view?"
terrible. okay; turn.
"yes, you sure do."
"stand by a minute, ron. let me clarify that. roger, it's west of the landing site, and i believe it's the bigger of the two."
"you want to hand me that book, and i'll take a look in it. t confid l 00 00 55 15 c_ yes. and also see if i've - all the things that i've done, ..., because i haven't checked them off a couple of places. 00 00 55 29 cm_ hey, fred, what do you want first, tv camera?"
"roger. 100, 00, 0006."
"very good, al. that came through loud and clear."
handle in.
either one. over.
dam_ good idea.
okay.
okay. have you got a weight that we can have?
"stand by, jack."
"yes; as a matter of fact, they were."
"boy, i mean to tell you."
"and, dave and jim- -"
... mine.
"oh! that last step down again. okay? bob, before - well, let me get this for you."
"that's affirmative. 07 21 36 55 c_'_p and leave the alpha-particle cover open and all that. okay. i'll just delete all those guys, and le-_ me read you what i have'. tbg.t's the ""laser altimeter - starting at 191:50 we'll go ""laser altimeter, off; _i&pping c/lmera/laser altinreter when it's in, the ""mapping camera/laser altimeter cover"" is to ""close,"" the happinc camera"" then comes ""off_"" and we go through a little ditty of ""33 seconds, standby; ihc, off."" while we're doing this, we can do a verb h9 to the attitude 322, 115, 305; aos high gain ansi!es will be pitch, minus 35; yaj, 235. i need to be in ._ttitude by 192:10. starting about 19!:55_ you want to start transfer of :24 equipment."
"go ahead, over."
i think that might be camelot.
"houston, just one other %uestion. i was looking around here at my film, and i got mag victor victor, which is vhbw for the nikon. and looking through the flight plan, it doesn't look like we're going to be able to use that anytime. i just wonder if we might be able to use it for some of these terminator photos?"
"dave, are you moving again?"
"that's just what i'm doing, taking a pan of thav thing. we got it."
"where you going to plug that other end in, lineman?"
okay.
standby.
what was that?
"sounds good. 03 o1 40 51 cml° houston, apollo 11. radio check."
"we're going to auto now, houston, to try to damp the rates. we're at the attitude."
"okay, we copy that."
two. 01 06 34 32 ia_p and one.
okay. just use john's.
it's very friable.

"okay. and, gene, when you leave the camera, a reminder to face it away from the sun and tilt it down."
huh? 08 10 00 07 imp ...
"yeah. lighter albedo - much lighter albedo. and if i had my druthers, it's somewhere between the gray and the white out on the plains."
okay.
"oh, just me (laughter)."
"hello, apollo ll. houston. prior to you start- ing your p52, we'd like to give you a new csm state vector. over."
"okay. and if you'll flip the page now - page 352 - the new time there is 243:40. where it says, ""maneuver to meed attitude,"" we want to change that again to 071, 051, 039, and the high gain angles are minus 34, 218. 08 21 36 18 _p okay. at the - this whole page has slipped an hour, and it's at 243:_0; 071, 051, 039, to minus 34 and a 218."
okay.
"... now, power up your fdi."
we don't think you'll get it this group but that pad is now about a 4-minute pad. but it's getting so close i'd like to watch it. cml_ okay.
that's about right.
that's what you need to do.
you can ask me.
"it's open now, pete."
"copy, al. and i'll be right back."
"hey, i think you ought to know where we are by now, bob."
"tranquility, houston. request recycle. apollo 11 air-to-grou_d voice transcription (goss net 1) tape 79/t"
got all sorts of little goodies to do. okay; turn right so i can get the r_mmer.

no.
okay. i thought we were moving along pretty good.
go ahead. 11 here.
okay. those scoop imprints look different than i imagined. 05 14 07'06 cdr okay.
"photo the scoop _renches at 5 feet, f:8, in stereo. watch it - watch it now; you're going to get dust on us."
"okay, jack. let me see if i have it. what we do is point the lm at the earth as we did for the midcourse coas, and we do a body-axis aline on the ags. then you give us an ags ball atti- tude to fly to .... t_e lm, and then we ... point the ... at the moon. then you would update the - give us some cdus to coarse aline .... fine aline ... on star_ or the moon or the earth. stand by. okay. we had another master alarm, jack. i don't see any lights down there, except the battery light's still there. you want - - ... display ecs. okay. and the number 2 battery still has a light on it. i suspect it may be the same problem that we had before ......"
"okay. lift away, you've got a rock box."
guess who else is.
mark it.
roger.
"okay, fine. thank you."
"and, ken, i guess you can go on to ptc at your convenience."
"okay. that does it for the cue card. 08 05 51 08 c_p all right. give me the flight pman now, if you will, please."
"master arm, off."
okay.
"and one other item we need, i guess, is a read- out on battery c and pyro batteries a and b voltage. this will be the last chance we'll get to look at them. 10 10 48 29 _ okay; stand by. battery c is 36 and 1/2. the pyro bats are both 36 and 1/2."
yes.
"17, houston. do you read me through the - through the lm?"
don't - don't smear them.
roger.
yes.
"endeavour, we're ready when we get the high gain going here. and i guess we'll have that ready about 5 minutes."
"okay, fredo, i'm - i'm back at the _._t, having left the lpm; took my time."
"... to park at this heading? 06 22 4k 09 cdr-eva i don't - no, i guess not. _at i'd like to do is park where it's flat, and -"
"okay, you have to - i had to pound it yesterday to get it closed."
okay.
"- - while i'm doing a p52. 0ops! excuse me, dave ...."
you've got to tape those.
"yes, they want the one we took out on the lunar surface."
"aquarius, it's a little too early to tell exactly how the ptc is going. we'd like to get a few more points, so keep reading them off, and we're still looking for that supercrit to go anytime."
"okay, that's that one? lock. there's your lock on that blue one. locked? okay. you closed? okay, that's locked. that's locked. locked. okay. having trouble getting them on there, jack, with the - shouldn't be too much pressure there. let me - let me push it on you."
okay.
"okay. slew rate, hi. okay, we're -"
you ready for this? ready for this?

... he say ... standby mode that i leave it? ...
"(laughter) roger. hey, inco says he's going to take care of the tape recorder, but you might ought to verify."
okay. you want the tape recorder on at minus 6 minutes.
"yes, okay. well, (laughter) a1 made the point that it's all changed anyway, because normally i bring on hank - the second bank in 3 seconds, and he doesn't have to worry about it. he's concentrating on the start transients and everything. so it's a complete change at any rate, and i think it might be a tad better to go to the 5 seconds with a1 on the circuit breaker."
"okay, dave."
i think that's that damned empty box that's been floating around for 3 days.
_ere you are - otis. 04 20 12 01 _cp e)on't step cn there.
"clear, and we're omni alfa. if you don't answer this transmission, we'll try the high gain again."
golly.
"roger. 02 20 02 28 cml° okay. at the top of the card, i've added a note that says, ""no verb 48 changes after entering 509.t_ the first step on the card is ""emi°509 is called."" i have deleted, ""load the dap."" under the ""bore- sight sextant star check,"" i have deleted verb 41 noun 91. i have replaced that with a note that says ""no verb 41 and use manual, monitor 1691."" i have changed the ""bus tie, on"" time from 54 min- utes to 4c minutes, and that changes ""minus 6"" to ""minus 20."" i have deleted the tape recorder line at minus 6 minutes. i've changed the time 55 to be 41, minus 5 to be minus 19, and that's all the changes i have on the front side of the burn card. on the back side, next to the ""proceed after the gimbal test option"": if the - if we get a glitch, it's ""rhc to stop rates, verb 23 noun 20 enter enter, verb 40 enter, and then verb 62 enter, man- ually maneuver to attitude."" after ""rate, high,"" and before 59 minuves, terminate emp 509. at minus 6 minutes, ""tape recorder goes to high bit rate, record, forward, and command reset."" at 00:xx, at engine cut-off, it's ""be prepared for scs takeover."" at ""tvc servo power, 1 and 2, off,"" we've added a note, ""prior to trimming noun 85, check noun 20 against the imu."" and that's all the comments i have on the burn card. 02 20 04 5b cc that's a good readback, ken, and just to reiterate, that ""terminate _o 509"" is associated with termi- nating the gimbal test or ending up on that."
it was in the left position.
"okay, yes i will - so you can take the pictures - - 06 21 53 50 6_r-_a yes. 06 21 53 51 i_-_a - - while i'm - -"
- - we need the sep on - -
okay. fine.
"yes, sir. it looked perfect. and we also went through the little co._m_uications main carrier subcarrier lockup check, and the - and the corem system worked perfectly, so there's no problems at all to report."
it looks like it was a lot thicker than - than a ray.
right.
"man, i tell you. you know, we're really up on top of this thing. whoo!"
"okay, aquarius, we're recommending you go to auto. let the thrusters fire and settle down and proceed with the test."
very good. well done. have you gotten the panorama?
"i think that - if we were on hot mike when we're talking to each other, i want to apologize right now. it's probably pretty interesting. probably not, if the comm was as bad as you said it was."
okay.
left - and right.
i'll look at the maps.
"negative on the centigrade, dave. however, when we turned the camera off at the end of eva 3, the temperature was up around 122 degrees."
"that's a real good view of the lm hatch handle there, 11. 0ver."
want to put the light back up? (tranq)
okay. ready for mapping camera and pan camera operations.
"it's on the met, bruce. it never made it en the celrffer a. 0k 21 58 59 cz i thir_ ed put it on. 04 21 59 02 i2,ff negative."
it's the only one around here.
how's the what?
"okay, houston; aquarius. how do you read us now?"
"where did you say that was located, jack? 02 08 18 0b cc that's in your systems checklist, page 1-5."
"ags status, off."
we didn't find it here ...
"ron, you have zero spares on rr. no - no film available for yourself on rr."
"okay, we've got about l0 - 20 seconds to entry interface."
"orion, this is houston. we want you to get the rendezvous radar and the tracking light off as soon as it's feasible. to conserve power."
"did you snap it, charlie? i - i got bare hands here. i can do that. okay. okay. can you - snap's all the way in the back. oh, you did vent it."
i don't know.
yes sir. okay. good bye.
"okay. let's get the descent engine sample, jim."
can you get it?
roger. i show you locking up.
"and in line with our 20-plus-hour clock sync, we had to go to day 10, meal b to catch up."
"okay, stand by 1, al."
roger. going to o_wi delta.
roger. we're zooming in on the earth now.
"okay. okay, hatch opening."
you might also check with fido whether we ... perigee ...
"okay, ron. and for jack, the surgeon says he's getting occasional erratic trace from jack's biomed. he would be happy if jack wants to take it clear off. l_ gordy, i don't know how to tell you this, but i haven't had my biomed on for about 6 hours."
okay. rcs logic is ... - -
"okay, power's coming on on."
"are you doing okay, charlie? 06 02 28 42 l_-eva yes, i'm doing fine."
"okay. this is in your checklist, 3-7, right-hand side of the page, following ""empty etb,"" where it shows ""1 - hcex mag b,"" delete that line. 05 10 26 04 lmp-l_ okay."
... got in the way here.
mark it.
i'll get it.
"the easiest way to do it would be to just go ahead and do it on vox, and we'll get everything recorded down here."
i got it right here - -
"okay, i didn't do anything. i just jiggled my mode switch here. okay, we got 2 and 3 on the eps, plus one under jack's seat. lcru blankets are opened 100 percent; battery covers are closed; dustbrush. i've got; tge, i've got; mags and polarization filter is taken care of; and i'm ready to traverse to the sep."
minus 77; minus 76 -
okay.
"tony, you got to be kidding."
"ron, this is houston. we're not going to be able to give you a handle on the delta-h until we have a chance to take all the data and reduce it and work it around a little."
"well, i think you can see rlmost everything from here."
"that's a good demonstration of how the crew has the interface with 'she computer, talking to the programs and all that we have in the computer. 01 10 3! 09 cmp well, that's right, charlie. sometimes it tells us things and sometimes we tell it things and mostly it talks to us."
"tohkearye. ori ngoott, ""gbaumtm,a weraya,lsodepwlaonyt"" toaftaedrd, ""p""amnasscais_preac to standby"" at 149:38. and i'll get the ""pa2_ camera, off"" until you tell me or when you tell _e. i'll take the ""mass spec discriminator to high."""
"and i don't know if jack passed it on to you, but jack and i just finished logging about 6 hours sleep, each. paso 144_2 03 1!050 5& (jo roger, fred. copy that. is it a ]ittie chilly up there?"
"without the met, because there's nobody ko - if anything falls off, we've lost all those goodies. 05 14 54 28 l_ i think s'!l just take a couple of rock bags - - 05 14 54 49 c_ okay, that's it. 05 14 54 50 imp - - fredo, my tongs and camera, and go."
"okay. it's some more like human interest stuff rather than pure news. one thing the - in the liberty bowl football game georgia tech beat iowa state. well, i guess it's not quite over yet - this is a fourth quarter score, georgia teeh 31, iowa state 24. and, there is a story about the moonship that's streaking smoothly homeward. there's nothing in it that you don't know about, though, except maybe one little part of the article describing a quote from william e. fastie of johns hopkins university, member of the orbital science team3 who said that a rather startling discovery is the moon is simply not degassing. it has nothing left in terms of any- thing that you think - that can create an atmos- phere. much to his surprise, even the amount of hydrogen, an element that should have been the most abundant outgassing candidate, turned out to be about i percent of its predicted value. he speculated that the absenco f a planetary magnetic field on the moon works to the purge surface of any atmospheric accumulation. the atoms of gases that have vented to the surface, he theorized, pick up an electrical charge then - and are then swept away by the solar wind, which is a stream of electrified atoms pushing far out into the solar system of the sun. former president truman is stabilized is the word they are using now. his heart condition is unchanged. his kidneys are failing him, and he's termed to be still in a very serious condition but resting comfortably. a declining birth rate and a desire for fewer children in the years ahead have caused the census bureau to reduce sharply its estimates of future popula- tion growth in the united states. by the year 2000, for example, the estimate is now 20 million fewer people than had been forecast on the basis of previous statistics. reduction could have major implications for american society in many areas. and it reflects changes in birth and child planning, which now suggest that the u.s. may eventually reach zero population growth. the last one is pretty interesting, and more so if you can see the picture that goes with the story, about james l. g. fitzpatrick who for 40 years has been interested in copying natural flight. and he has now designed a batlike flying machine that may be ready for a test run next summer. fitzpatrick said that the first - that first, every small part of the ungainly structure must be tested carefully. otherwise you end up either in a disaster or a grave, and we try to avoid that sort of thing. after three decades of trying, fitzpatrick, who's 66, believes his latest device comes closest to the real thing, although it still needs a small motor to flap the wings. asked whether his device, as yet unnamed, works on the flight principle of a bird, he said, ""i don't know anyone who knows what principle a bird works on, but i guess this f is more like a bat of a pterodactyl."" fitzpatrick's ornithopter or flapping wing airplane is equipped with cockpit controls that include a throttle that regulates the 1-horsepower engine and up-and-down flight. other equipment includes rudder pedals to regulate a power steering system, a parking brake, a pseudopaddagieum, i don't know what that one - that word is, it's a new one on me, to trans- fer power from the engine to the wings, and a two-way radio. it has a maximum 40-foot wingspan and weighs 320 pounds. it is 6 feet long and it looks like a cage of scaffolding covered in parts by canvas. he said he's far enough along on build- ing his device that he will be able to test the way the wings move in the staten island community college gym by the first of the year. however, there will be no free flying. the gymnasium test will involve tying weights to the wing tips and flapping the wings. he said that his bird is rather slow in maturing; and it's been a long gestation period which involved 9000 hours of experimentation, $40,000 in his money, and the dissection of 300 birds of various species. ""i've been interested in flight since 1930,"" he said. ""basically, i was curious as to why various things flew, and i've been painfully finding out ever since."" and he winds up with a real quote here. he said, ""never has so much been done with so little success."" that's the news. no, wait - wait a minute. one final closing story. in atlanta, georgia, a 5-year-old boy crawled up on santa's lap in a department store and asked him what santa would need if he had two boots and one sock. dick wright, a georgia state university graduate student in the off season, said he thought quickly and replied, ""another sock,"" and the child punched him in the stomach."
56. yes. okay. 00 02 43 25 aria apollo 12 ...
dick?
"oh, it's afternoon down there."
following us?
"mark lmp. it was a streak; right eye; moving from the top down toward the bottom, intensity 4."
yes. we're almost to the crater.
eoger. we'd like to stay away from the ptc for about 15 more minutes. 08 10 08 00 cml° okay; we'll do that.

all right.
"reg a is closed. gene, ::an you get .mywater?"
"okay; we're coming out across either an elongate crater, or two that are kind of joined up - running east-west, kind of a doublet, and we're going _ across the bridge between them. 05 03 42 25 i2_p-eva and it must be, maybe 30 meters across on each one of them with no debris and they're smooth on the bottom."
"as i look around the area, the contrast, in general, is *** comes about completely by virtue of the shadow *** down sun ... very light-colored gray, light gray color, a halo around my own sha- dow, around the shadow of my helmet. then, as i look off across *** the contrast becomes strongest in that the surromlding color is still fairly light. as you look down into the sun *** a larger amount of *** shadowed area is looking toward us. the general color of the *** surrounding *** the contrast is not as great. surveying all the dusty area that we've kicked up *** considerably darker in texture. now, i've kicked up one, _ld i ima- gine that this is *** surveyor. the same is true when i survey across on - along the area that we're walking, in general *** to the fact that there are footprints there. general terrain where i've been kicking up a lot of this surface material is generally of a darker contrast *.**color_ 04 ih 31 29 !2_p the panorama i'll be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus ***"

"houston, tranquility. could you give me the (tranq) fixed portion of the ascent pad so i can load it in for a p577 over."
we'd be better off putting them in where the - where the lcgs are.
that's fine.
got that ...
okay. let - let me my scoop.
"well, you old fink. '_ tape 111/3"
roger. have to change windows.
"good idea, why not do it?"
"well, just briefly, gordy, i feel that i have done something that's very significant here in my life. i hope that - and will do eyerything i can to see that it is not the most significant thing i ever do. but, i feel that the fact that i had the opportunity to do in a large part to the tangible and intangible effects that my mother and father had on my life and to them i send my thanks and i hope that i continue to live up to their expectations."
yes.
"okay. okay - oh, no hurry!"
"okay; and, ron, we'd like h2 tanks 2 and 3 fans to on."

"wait a minute, charlie. we gonna stay, houston?"
"america, houston."
"no, we - we lost you on the comm there, dick. at minus 2 minutes and we verified we scratched the delta-v thrust a or b, to normal, and substituted cb sps pilot valve main b, closed. that's the last we heard from you."
yes....
roger. i'll put a mark here and mark it on my map so you can look at it preflight - postflight.

"okay, is that -"
"no, you just don't reach that either."
"houston, this is ed. how do you read? oh 17 09 07 cc ed, this is houston. over."
say again what it is.
"okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the center s-ii engine vibrated at a some- what higher amplitude than we've seen on previous flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into the s-ii burn. as a result of these vibrations, the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust- okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off. early evaluation of data indicates that no damage occurred to the engine, and the cause of the in- creased vibration amplitude is still under inves- tigation. over."
okay.
looks funny like that.
roger; we copied down here. thank you. i
you got an upper?
my personal guess is that it - fillet didn't come off that rock.
he's probably spilling coffee in span.
"that's a very good question, and i - i'm not sure we're qualified to - to say. we'll have to get back and talk to everybody. i - i don't - i don't think it - i didn't notice it being in there as far as taste was concerned. and i don't think anybody else did."
okay. (laughter) thank you.

"and so it's sort of your option as to how much time you spend here and how much you go on to station 7 and spend. if you feel that it's worthwhile, we could spend essentially all that hour and 20 minutes at this station. but if we did that, we'd like to get a fair variety of blocks, if they're available."
"houston, you are now wit - witnessing one of the longest 10-minute periods in history."
"okay. have you got it? 06 22 b5 b5 lmp-eva yes, i got it. hey, bob. i got my rock. it's halfway between the sep and the lm. wait, wait. let me put it in the big bag - in the big bag."
"okay. and, jim, i saw the landing site as we passed over it. we're not going to have any trouble recognizing it from the rays. the rays stand out beautifully."
"okay, suit's on 17"
"yes, do that, will you? sorry you missed that other one."
ail righty.
"that's true, and it certainly was good. inciden- tally i did look for the - the particle cloud that was around me at sunrise, and it looked like it had diminished somewhat from the sunrise - or from the sunset terminator. but it may have been - it may have been the angle of the sun- light also."

"and, then, you turn it back on at the re - where it says ""reset stop watch and start."" the time zero there - point. prior to that, turn it on. i'll remind you of it."
"okay. i guess, based on our drifts, i'm not sure that's any better, but i guess that's no worse, so i'll just go to that one, then."
huh?
"it was the profile of the water quantity as you were filling both plss's, and it was the fill - during jack's fill that looked suspicious like just maybe 3 pounds less than there should have been flow when you were filling jack's."
"(laughter) yes, right. that was the biggest problem the first 2 or 3 days here - what do you do with your head when you go to sleep. i'm used to sleeping with a pillow. and i'm used to sleeping on my side. and it's amazing the psychological ef- fect that you can get from - for me it's hard to go to sleep just laying on my back. so you can - turn on your side and you go right to sleep (laughter). what's your side and what's your back - i don't know, but anyhow, it works."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
"*** you, dr. fletcher. we appreciate your comments, and we certainly appreciate those of the president. and whether it be civilian or military, i think jack and i would *** like to *** salute to america. 06'23 09 54 lmp-eva dr. fletcher, if i ***, i'd like to remind every- body, i'm sure, of something they're aware, but this valley, this valley of history, has seen mankind complete its first evolutionary steps into the universe, *** the planet earth and going for- ward into the universe. *** think no more signifi- cant contribution has apollo made to history. it's not often that you can foretell history, but i think we can in this ease. *** think everybody ought to feel very proud of that fact. *** very much."
"houston, we've already done that, and we still don't receive anything."
"good readback. and we'd like to get the ga_a ray, shield on."
okay. it's back to about zero on the ball.
"... in yours. okay? it's in gene's sample collection bag. and a scoop sample. you got a bag handy, gene? okay, bag 455, bob. it's from the west side of the rock. it's under a slight overhang of the rock - in a shadow, anyway. okay, that's from about i centimeter down - deep, i to 2 centimeters. and the next one is down to about 5 - 5 or 6. and it's got some chips in it."

"not unless that's what this diffuse and central feature turns out to be. but the dark - oh, let me rephrase that, the higher concentration of material that makes it look more solid - if that's a large particle and the diffuse material is the finer particles, then i would say that perhaps there was a separation of small oarticles from larger ones in tube number 2 just about the time i reversed it, just starting to show up; s_nd number 1 perhaps the same. and number 3, i would say, if that's the proper interpretation, that there was no appreciable separation of any kind. and i'm not sure that number 1 ever exhibited the - some of the symptoms that number 2 did. i can't tell you right now which of these tubes splurted these blobs of particles under the window unit."

"roger. in answer to your question on the dse, we'll handle the dse from down here when we start the eye-flash experiment. we do have a - a request of you before you start the experiment, though. we don't have the necessary oxygen purity in the lm yet that we think that we're going to need for the surface evas several days from now. and - consequently, we want you to start to vent the lm once again. we're going to drain it out and fill it with oxygen again later on today. so, if you would please, turn the tunnel vent valve to the vent position before we start the eye flash."

"jim, just a bit of information, if for any reason you had to slip tig , our people here feel it wouldn't do much harm if you slipped it up to 30 minutes. the procedure, of course as you know, is not to pro on the flashing 99 and we thought you might like to be aware that t. time isn't all that critical, lg"
"orion, houston. how do you copy us?"
"roger, buzz. stand by."
"oka_ 15, we're back with you. we just had a sit_ changeover."
"roger. we show the logic arm, and you're go for pklq0arm. 00 04 !6 38 cdp houston, we're ready for lm ejection."
"oh, that orange soil was something."
"bag number 2, dave."
we got our tracking light on.
"oh, and, bob, i got another pair of pictures. and that would be up to 134."
"houston, you got a circuit breaker or two we could check on that one?"
okay - -
"radar needles are off. 05 22 33 01 lmjp say, you got a 50 18 to take you back."
(laughter)
"i'll tell you, why don't you put - under your restraining cable; just stow it under your re- straining cable there. and that will keep, then, until we're ready for them. 03 19 45 _8 cmp can i have my juice? 03 19 45 53 lmi° ... there's an orazige in yours."
"you're all 85-foot dishes, right? ears, i mean."
let's give it a go.
"looks like - it looks more like a valley, you know, that runs east-west. 05 23 29 35 iaip-eva yes, sure does."
"okay, i was on min."
loud and clear.
"19k, houston. we're go coming up on 8."
"okay, and the injector valve temos are lookin_ as follows: 5c, 4.5; sd, 4.6; 6a, 4.1; 6b, 4.4; 6c, 4.9; 6d, 4.4. which means no heatup."
"okay, al. and i have a csm consumables update and a number of other things, when you're ready to listen to them '."
"we've got 58 total, john."
"apollo 13, houston."
roger.
"it appeared to us that we attempte{ to load the erasable prior to entering on the _erb 49 which verb 49 was still running, and it clobbered the cdu's. over."
look at my camera lens and see how dirty it is.
okay. the only thing i don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. what rate should it have taken off at under that theory?
roger. we believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south. over.
houston. this is 15.
i can't -
it's pretty cloudy down there tonight. about the only land i can see again is a portion of australia and korea and looks like a part of china. just about clouds covering everything else.
"dkay, houston. we're doing our maneuver, and we'll tell you as soon as we have a visual."
okay.
that's really bright.
"go ahead, hadley. this is houston."
"apollo 15, houston. 02 06 12 34 cml° houston, 15. go ahead, joe."
i'll split it with you.
the big eye. okay. there's a neat rock. right there. doesn't look like a breccia.
90:40:50 is what i'm looking for.
"roger. we'll worry about those when we start driving in pluton. 04 l0 54 38 i_p-iz_ can you see the edge of the rille up - dave, can you see the edge of the rille? 04 l0 54 45 cdr-seva no."
- - and verify the mtvc.
"well, the thing is, do we want to do the whole station 8 activity - the comprehensive sample?"
looks like someone walked across it.
okay.
"okay. torso tiedown and adjusted. i'm going to pull it down a little bit more today - this stiff suit's not _ui_e tight enough. 05 !0 56 35 lmp okay, 02 connectors, three."
"okay. okay, is she in there? yes - it's in the flight plan. okay."
"houston, this is america. i guess that's for me, isn't it?"
stand by.
you're in auto track.
"roger, minus 2 - minus 02800. standing by for the enter."
okay.
you see a ray coming out of menelaus going through - through bessel? is that one of tycho's rays?
"houston, aquarius."
"okay. ll o1 47 53 r-1 tico, this is recovery. did you receive the apollo 16 report? all three chutes are fine. they are looking good as they're coming down. over."
"houston, apollo 13. give me a call when you're ready for e-memory dump."
ail right. i can't hardly tell the difference between one-sixth g - -
okay.
"okay, joe. i've got a - another subangular frag- ment here. rough surface texture. and, knock a little dust off of it, and it looks like a very fine-grained, gray - rather solid frag. i don't see any significant pits or any significant-size crystals in there. it might just be because the surface covering; but just a smooth, fairly hard rock."
got it.
pulse.
"think we're going to have to do some dusting before we go in, and it's going to take us a little long. i'll get those, jim. i'll get them."
"apollo 11, houston. we're getting the tv at goldstone. we're not quite configured here at houston for the transmission. we'll be up in a couple of minutes. over."
why don't you get the ...?
and that should take care of all little squares in that msfn update box at 28 - at 95:25.
okay.
okay.
"columbia, columbia, houston. over."
"okay, 21. yes. yes, let's coarse - let's vorque this and then i'll do another one. cmld (hu_mning). yes. yes. yes. 09 15 38 3d cmp yes, that brought it in there nice and close. we'll just tweak her up just for the heck of iv. yes. 09 i5 39 30 cmp well, ptttth! how's our time doing? cm_ well, that was close enough, really, but - that's within the limits, but i'd like to get her down to at least 0.01."
ckay.
okay.
give up?
"okay. plus 002.74, plus 109.36, plus 004.57."
there goes the old tv. trouble getting it to fit today.
"mark. duke - a fuzzy flash in the upper left eye, simultaneously with a bright dot in the right eye."
"oh, boy."
"okay. it's looking through the aot in position 4, right rear. and we're looking back toward the - over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module."
somebody got into the shitlocker. 03 13 10 _2 cdr (laughter)
"roger. roger, al. 04 06 lb 00 cmp okay, houston. the burn got off c_ time. burn time, 4 seconds; vgx, minus 0000.9; and i trimmed that to 0 at - roll of 0, pitch of 107, and yaw of 358. v was plus all zero's, v was plus all gx gy zero's, v was minus 0000.5 · delta-v was gz c minus 11.2; fuel was 29.25; oxidizer, 29.15; and unbalance meter was decreased 50. and i've got me in a 65.2 by 54.8. apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay. 07 04 28 36 _ how many g's you got, babe? 07 04 28 b7 cmp ... about three-quarters - -"

"yes, you're right."
"i will do my best, sir. l0 ll _2 53 cc apollo 15, houston. over."
"yes, i think this is the one we culled. isn't it, jim?"
"i've got to put your - those samples in the src, in your bag; and we'll save this one, i guess."
"okay, i guess we could give you two. the - our trusty cmp has his off and stowed for entry."
"boy, i tell you -"
okay; thank you.
"like just small valleys that are trending upslope, joe. and - we go down low enough so that we can't see the lm anymore. won't see him until we get on top of the next rise. they're very gentle valleys. and they're about - would you say - 60, 70 meters across ?"
we're on our way back home.
"boy, that sure was drilling in hard stuff because it took a lot to get it off."
"come on, baby, hang in there."
isn't that neat?
"i'm sure he did, dave, but we're wondering if you ever heard him call you on vhf - it sounds like we're going to have to do a vhf comm check. 04 09 59 51 cdr-i_4 no, we tried that coremcheck 3 minutes prior to pdi and we didn't get - we got no response, and houston verified that the endeavour could hear us, but we did not hear him."
that's right_ w:ithhis feet up into the tunnel.
roger. are you in wide bes:n now?
your comm check should come in about 25 minutes.
we maneuvering?
he didn't say.
"okay. roger. configuration now: h2 heaters 1 and 2, auto; 02 heaters ! and 2, off; 3, we're auto. that's as we had it. h2 fans i and 2, off; and 3, off."
okay. we don't really have a feeling for that even though we've probably got a watch here; we're not - we're not able to watch it.
"if you had a - if you'd had a liquid man_le and the crater sticking up through it, you might have the mare not only on the floor of the crater, but the mare would be on the exterior walls of the crater. you'd see a high-water mark along the exterior, wouldn't you?"
is that all?
"well, dadg_,mm_tx that latch is -"
"okay, dave, while you're working there we're thinking that we'd prefer just a very quick sam- pling - of - of the large rock, if at all. and perhaps just a quick photographic documentation of that large rock and then some rake sample."
about 2 o'clock.
huh?
"okay, traverse to i_4: 12 minutes, 085/1.4_ that's - man, that says 086/1.4 to the lm, and my checklist 085/1.4. we must have landed where they wanted us to."
"okay, 385."
"well, i had me worried, too. i knew - i knew the one with the good rocks, i hadn't lost, because i stuck that in the seat pan. but i thought i'd put one on you, and now i remember i started to put it on you, and your harness looked loose, so i stuck it on the hand tool carrier where it's got a lock. so we're okay."
grumman just hired you. 04 16 05 38 tap yes.
"yeah, i - i agree with you. they want you to be active."
okay. go ahead.
"it's measuring right now, jack, we'll get it later. cdr-ev_ ail right."

"yes, sir. f"
how many did we have? ...
"you know, i been getting light flashes with my eyes open. 00 02 03 23 _p (laughter)"
what we should have done was allowed ourselves more time to ...
nothing. (laughter )
... solid ...
mark.
did you really?
"okay, aquarius. we're going to dispense with this control mode. we'd like you to fly the machine back to the original attitude that you had, and we'll go pgns attitude hold, and then we've got to get that ball off the line to save some power. and then, in order to keep even heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll - of yaw."
"ed, i have some ags cal numbers for you."
"yes. well, either that or - yes, that's right, see."
copy.
yeah. sure do.
"roger. pitch 165, yaw 68. over."
okay. i'll be ready to do it whenever you -
"okay, look. we're going to probably have some trouble with the comm here, hank. are you sure you want to stay in down voice backup or - just exactly what? we're ready to go into the ... on the lunar checklist - the lunar surface checklist, and john's got his suit on. and we're gonna put the plss's on."
*** you're covered. okay. *** getting to our favorite part here. (laughter) okay. purge valves are installed on both. pga diverter valve; put it vertical.
okay; baker 7 and 8.
"okay. on my mark. descent prop isol valve; 3, 2, 1-"
"okay, l_ar sounder is in standby."
"hey, wait a minute. how about this?"
"those things seem backwards to me, the plsss."
"yes, speed's dropped down to 7 clicks."
"okay. that should be plenty. and, i got the maga- zine xx loaded in the hycon, and i am ready to go to work on that as soon as we get in the darkness. well, maybe that won't work, because i guess you got a p52 and things coming for me."
"oh, that's right. you don't have any maneuvers. 03 23 40 22 cml° no, i - i laid it on them. i said, ""those switches, as long as i'm by myself, are going to stay in deploy/r_ract all the time."""
"okay. jack, how do you read?"
"yes, are you going to leave us? oh, okay; i got it. okay? okay, i'll get ... take care of this. many you guys got a lot of dirt up there."
go ahead. cdr-i_ bob.
but we can do that inside.
and all those lights on.
"roger, jack. we understand. and i think we copied most of what you said there, and we're working on it."
clunk! back to safe.
roger. 03 22 26 30 imp - - and get you the down-link. over - the e-memory dump. over.
"okay. 05 ]7 27 5] cc aquarius, houston."

"apollo 13, houston."
stand by for throttle up; thrust-to-weight is okay.
"well, it's definitely different from the next rock, or the one we just picked up. 06 01 37 41 ia{p-eva yes. you mean - -"
"yes. wait; let go a minute. 05 1308 50 cdr i'm with you, houston."
there we go.
okay. 07 02 43 _2 lmp-eva here's the rock. i'll get the camera for you. and i guess i'll go on back and take the brush. okay?
"wait, wait. want me to bang that tv first?"
"go _o f/ll. get a little closer, geno, if you think you're minimum."
okay.
"oh, i understand. charlie stole it."
40 at 3.
(laughter) okay; what time is it?
"roger. 86 hours, ""manually pressurize the sps ."""
"and, dave, give us a call as you come up toward spur - -"
"roger, jim. good morning. tei-71, sps/g&n. the weight is not applicable. p trim: noun 48 is plus 0.64, plus 0.98; 217:49:18.04; plus 2838.6, minus 0581.0, minus 0027.7; 178, 129, 351; the rest is na. four jet ullage for 12 seconds. and that 's all."
go on and get rid of it. 04 22 54 54 ijvfp that's a good idea; you can move it out of the way.
"and now we're - there's - there's another ray we're coming in out of south ray, which definitely out of south ray, you can see it trending right on in to south ray."
... goes unstable ...
how about another bacon? and we'll eat this canadian bacon and leave one of these kind.
"okay, jack. pressure in tank 1 is approaching 100 psi. what's going to be the symptoms of this fuel cell starting to drop off?"
"balance couple, on."
okay.
no. we have to do that.

i don't know what this thing is. it's really weird.
"although, i'll tell you, we never got to see half of what we passed over, i'm sure. there's just so much up there."
"geno, everything is in good shape down here. the booster's in good shape; you're looking good; and · their aos time is 52:20 as i'gave you."
okay.
okay.
roger; copy.
"charlie, are you ready to copy the flight plan change s?"
i don't know; we'll tell them.
"okay. i'm going to turn off b-3 and also my roll jets, and then i'm going to undo the docking latches."
"roger, jack. and the thrust is go on all five of them. they're running good."
okay.
okay.
"okay. now, he loaded - he loaded his p30 and you're looking at - -"
huh?
roger.
"okay, let me plug this thing in, pete."
"okay, well, we'll keep those bags under your feet, anyway."
"eagle, houston. we don't care what - all we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison."
okay. main b only.
"okay, my comm is set. there they go."
understand. that's satisfactory and recommended that you leave it in the stowage spot. that should help the situation.
take a picture and let's see.
yes.
see all your flags?
"yes, it - subtle though - subdued."
- - was thrown out of the craters.
okay; we're configured.
"i'll be goddamned if i know what's wrong with it. stupid son of a bitch. all right, we're in sun- light. our cs - cdh time is 144:00:1 - -"
yes.
... 08 20 09 15 i_p is it up all the way? yes - you - you have to push pretty hard to get it on there.
"yes, we're just wondering if maybe the - maybe it was an air bubble or something in there - in the - small g-riel d of that midcourse 7 burn might have changed something. just like to take a look at it. cml° okay. we'll take a look at her."
cabin looks great - -
"i'm sorry, i lost you that time. say it again."
"what's that, charlie?"
and the drive to station 4 will be nominal and we'll get a rover sample at about 094/5.1 but it will be the track as indicated on the map and the cuff checklist.
"okay, plss mode, both, to 0. audio circuit breaker open and connect to i_mcomm."
yes. wait a minute - -
"say, would you giraffes give us some comment on your boot penetration as you move across there, what you're doing now, and what you had back there at sharp crater? 05 ]-310 30 lmp oh, it's much firmer here. we don't sink in anywheres near as much. now, i'm crossing some of my own tracks."
"... first thing we've been concerned about - i guess we'll start off with this is, according to our data, you lost about 25 pounds of water during the post-eva yesterday, and, we - it - it appears that it leaked out during that problem you had with the broken bacteria filter. what we're wondering is if you've looked around carefully in the cabin, and noticed any sign of that 25 f_ pounds of water. we suggest looking back behind the ascent engine cover, because it possibly would have run back there and not have been obvious to you. over. 05 18 05 08 cdr-i_ okay. there was some on the floor in the ... deck, and we just never took the time to take a look in the back, but we will."
"columbia, houston ...."
okay.
"in fact, i couldn't get down in there."
popped right out. looks good.
*** we gather an etb is coming up with two cameras in it.
okay. go ahead.

"okay, you wa,qt to read some '.c:ps? 06 02 35 56 i24p-eva yeah. we've got 55 - 50."
"go ahead, karl."
why?
roger. we will. stamd by.
"jim, we're not sure that the cameras are running properly. we want you to check the two seb cir- cuit breakers on panel 5, in, and confirm for us that you got the right talkback when you turned them on."
"shucks, we've just got to do this."
"t62 this is hetlston. iow i3 you read? 07 10 59 39 c._,_ loud and clear, jim."
"push the pallet while i trip the latch, will you? because i got to trip the latch. there's so much dust in that core."
"16, i guess we don't need the - the heaters. we're looking at all the data now. t' 00 08 40 43 cdr okay, we didn't say ""heater""; we said ""meter. ''"
so i can get on with the penetrometer.
"well, that's dirty. okay. i'm changed. and i don't know what the mag count is, but let me get the d6ea. if this thing is true to form, i'm going to have to get in there - i got to - ... tripped. well, now what's - hey, we got some rocks in that big bag. okay. we're done with the sep. dsea is coming out. i hope there's something on it. 06 21 55 h5 cdr-eva oh - jiminy christmas - i can't even pick up that big bag to close the gate."
"ed, i read you loud and clear. 05 10 40 !_ lmp okay_ fredo. and i have an 0 - plss 02 quantity of 87 percent."
...
"yes, sir, this is the one we climbed up. would you believe that?"
what are the surface guys doing now - are they cleaning up after the eva?
"okay. lm3 i'll try to get some exercise, and then i'll be back at you with some more information. maybe we can see the philippines by then."
okay; that sounds good.
"okay, bob, you're looking at it - coming out to the south, but i don't expect it'll stay that way unless i put some dirt over the cable. how does that grab you?"
columbia is coming up on a verb 45 enter to reset (columbia) the surface flag.
"roger, houston. read you loud and clear. we're watching the moonset."
"rational, i think, decision, that's because we couldn't get the sps to burn or rcs to burn."
roger. mighty fine.
"endeavour, this is houston. we'll be requesting 0mni delta when you lose the up-link."
cut-off at 52. did you read the dsky?
"... g&c checklist, i guess that -where's that in the g&c checklist? let's see what we're doing here."
"super. now, okay."

"apollo 16, this is houston through aria. over."
"houston, i was talking with dave. say again."
"here we go, 66.3 by 54.7."
"okay, now that we got another look at you, gordy, it looks like houston might be right on the fringes of either being clear or clearer. the entire gulf is pretty nice. florida looks pretty clear, and mexico looks pretty clear. there's a big air mass of clouds that looks like it picks up somewhere around the coast at houston, heads on up north, and then covers most of the midwest and the east - from about the middle of mississippi, alabama, and georgia on north. it's clear enough now to even see the coral reefs down off of florida. apollo 17 air-t0-ground voice transcription"
okay.
"okay, here -"
"oh, i'm sure it will."
trim. trim.
mark cmp.
"go ahead, houston."
okay. we'll be standing by for it.
"okay_ ron. you probably ought to think about - if it's getting kind of dark there for seeing or any- thing, you might consider getting in the p52, although you're a couple more minutes - still a couple minutes left on it. if you can see back at anything within reiner gamma - -"
it's the whole thing.
copy that.
"now, wait a minute."
"okay, jim. a few pictures and you can walk back and, dave, we want you to start on the rover, please."
"hello, houston. what happened to houston, al?"
"okay, we've got a good picture on the monitor up here. you got the tv switch in the right spot, jim?"
"okay. turn the tape recorder off. tape recorder's off. ....,mmmm uaz m m eva-3 final preparation to post-eva-3"
"just a moment. 01 06 23 13 cml° yeah, i'm not asking for one_ i'm just asking if that's in there."

"i want to mark something on my chart, and then i'll talk to you for just a minute."
... let me see that locked?
"well, i tell you, i - i'm - i'm really confused, because i am thoroughly convinced that what john's been saying about everything goes up to the tunnel is true. and in sim bay attitude with only the minus-x jets firing, that makes sense. and it's true i'll wake up in the morning, and the - the tool e is always hanging that way, the jett bag's up there, all my trash is going up there. it's a - it's a self-cleaning cockpit. 07 22 28 41 i_p yeah."

roger. copy.
we're showing a 10th of a pound right now.
"ali right, sir."
"okay. that's fine - that's great - that's what we needed to know. okay. the next question we'll - we'll get when we get the rocks back, but i think - well, maybe the best way to do this is to describe a theory that's coming up as a result of the rocks you've - that you saw there. it looks as if - or - a possibility is that an older theory that was discarded a few years ago may be the right one, that the cayley is an outer fluidized ejecta from imbrium. fra mauro would be an inner ring, and then imbrium sculpture would be outside of that, and then the cayley would be sort of slosh that filled up all the valleys farther on out. but some of the questions that the geologists are - are pressing here is something that might help them define that. and a lot of it is that they're just - can't wait for the rocks to get back. but anyway, at station 11, you described some rocks you thought to be tuff. looking back at station 5 and 6, after seeing these at 11, do you think you might have seen the same kind of rock there? what we're thinking about is where you described the - the square crystals and the needlelike crystals in clasts. and also, in the same question, were these crystals by themselves or were these - i mean, were the cras - clasts single crystals or were the crystals in clasts?"
"okay, joe. can you give me any stars that i might try here?"
it's down and locked.
"okay. i'm about to finish up on my coffee here. if it's something i don't need to write down, i'll just listen to what you have to say as you - as you read it off."

"yes; okay. connect the ops 02 hose to pga, blue to blue."
i think you're all right.
"why'd they tell us to pro, then? that wasn't the right thing to do, was it?"
"yes. this is one on the - about 50 meters right on the rim crest of henry, almost due - the wast rim - due west rim. now locke is just ahead of us. it also has boulders in its walls but has relatively few on the rim. characteristic of both henry, locke, - -"

"but everything appeared to function properly, huh, the alsep and you - you're pretty happy with it?"
and do you have a 231 update?
"roger, gene. 04 14 45 49 cdr-_4 the visibility prior to pitchover was such that i could see nansen. i could see the scarp. i could see lara. i could not see camelot until after pitchover. however, once i had pitchover, if i could have froze it right there like we do in the simulator occasionally, i could have picked out everything there was to see. even at 6000 feet, the small triangle with frosty and rudolph and punk were visible to me. i had - i had poppy from orbit, as a matter of fact, so it was - easily - easy to see. barjea was a very sharp round crater just as depicted on the lna. the thing i really didn't get a good look at, because i didn't pay too much attention to it, was from trident on to the south."
that's a good one.
"fredo, you're breaking up completely .... state- merit."

okay. i'm sorry. i should have told you first. i really wasn't anticipating you having to copy all that. i'm kind of rambling and being verbose. but i can see that i'm not going to get everything i see written down and probably ought to go ahead and get it jotted down some way.

how'd you do it?
slew. okay?
"well, like he says - it seems to me what he means is that - is that the thtng's just going to deplete the helium in there."
"roger. sounds like you had essentially no veloc- ity, except vertical. 05 lo 05 06 lmp-i_ that - and, deke, the landing didn't seem that hard, but we must have stroked the gear. the - the bell is about 10 inches off - less than that - about 4 or 5 inches off the ground. but the mesa was sitting right on the ground. we had to pick it way up, and the alsep was less than eye level, really. 05 l0 05 2h cc well, it could be our simulation isn't all that good, either. 05 l0 05 33 i_mp-i_ that's true."
"and, aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the pgns dap hold your attitude for you, it will."
in work.
"okay, joe. if you're ready to copy, here we go: 280, 017, 055, 039, 105, 110, 090, 090."
i don't smell it and i got a real good sniffer.
you want to do that now?
"and the buddy slss bag will just barely hold one cartridge plus the other debris we have. so i think we're going to have to use a jettison bag to put in the other cartridge, the two li0h canis- ters, and helmet bag with the water, and i think the helmet bag will hold the water okay. it seems to be fairly waterproof. and i just did the urine stowage as we had it."
roger. what about - -
{}kay.
"let's see, we're about 37:06 and there's -"
"go ahead, houston."
"okay; and, gene, we'd like to torque to 287, 287."
okay. we copy that. what do you nctice?
"roger. copied. and the torquing angles are minus 00.019, a plus 00.021, and a minus 00.061° over."
"okay, next, and the last is on page 3-15, charlie. let me know when you're there."
okay; good.
"okay. operate, still barber pole."
camera on?
"roger. we copied that you said they were open, john."
okay. give me a clue about a minute ahead of'th_lt.
- - would be a good station 2.
"you don't think that burn was enough, do you?"
"looky here. well, why don't you get your - well -"
"go ahead, houston."
there goes the 02 flow high - i'd say the water's _ day 4 _ page 97
yes. 05 14 06 23 i_mp it's going to be a tough shot.
okay. we got that.
"well, i'll push you if you don't mind."
"roger, al. 05 15 02 68 _p okay. here's one of a rock. take two of the rocks. now, i am taking a picture of pete's footprint in the soil. you can take a look at the interaction of that. take another one."
"aquarius, houston. go."
you know what i need?
"you know how to hurt a guy, don't you?"
yeah.
"are we doing what we're supposed to he doing, leader?"
okay.
okay.
everything looks good.
there it is. okay. let me try to get them. put them in here.
225 - -
yes.
coming up on b.
"... might, i been looking for residuals. see how well it burns when we ..."
"okay, that second one was deleting a cover closed, but i'm sure that's the one you got. mapping cahera/laser altimeter cover - closed. and that laser altimeter, we'll just leave her run through the sleep period. 08 22 4} 03 l_p okay."
"go ahead, houston."
"of the ground, no doubt."
"16, houston. about 30 seconds to los. we should get - should have you through aria at 2:22, a couple of minutes later than shown in the flight plan. over. 00 01 54 33 _ roger; understand. aria i (rev 2)"
okay. that's in work.
"bob, it's hard to give you much *** into the sun the way we are."
"plus zero .... if we load it that way? 03 11 58 54 csfp yes, it should. let's try it."
"whatever that was, okay."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
"okay. good show. 05 23 21 47 i_p-eva happy day. 0kay; lrv prep. hdec to rcu - left seat to rcu. pan, i got. hrdc rcu to left seat."
"you know, we've got one hell of an inclination to the sun; will you look at that - inclination angle of those shadows?"
open or closed?
roger. i got some torquing angles for you.
"okay, average g is on."
okay.
could you tell me which side of the sim bay?
i'm going up there.
"ckay. the cover is off of the laser, and it's completely clean. o_ 21 03 59 cc _oger. o_ 21 04 06 cdr _nd it iid not move during the cover removal."
"(laughter) you aintt gonna take credit for it, huh? ... i'd have .swore i heard you say pitch up."
no. we've missed it.
okay.
we are.
"that's right. as a matter of fact, so many of them, it's just hard to - hard to remember it all. but we sure appreciate all you all did for us in getting us ready for this thing. and i'll tell you, i think jim and i both felt quite comfortable when we got there, about looking around and - and seeing things. i just wish we had had more time, because, believe me, there is an awful lot to be seen and done up there."
"okay, now we need a little bit of quantity in the accum - not the accum, but we need the fuel valve on for about 5 percent on down to 45 percent. that's about what it was in the ..., too."
columbia. roger. (columbia)
"we missed her, fred. let's get it on the next minute. 04 09 05 17 _ okay."
okay. we are going to skip the e-mod dump for right now and get the uplink in.
say again. you're breaking up.
okay.
"okay, ken_ we've had sunrise, and the sun is behind us. i guess that's the best cue. 0_ 01 50 15 cmp ... star. i bet that's you."
"yes, that was the real moonglow."
"okay, houston. do you read odyssey?"
"man, will it ever."
"yes, that's a good idea, joe. best idea you've had all morning. i don't know what's wrong with this camera. i checked all the film again and ran it through with my finger a few times and made sure that the film was right on the - the preparations were right on the red mark. so -"
"not very little, though. i_4p-eva okay, bob. boy, i wish i could see a little bit better."
thank you. i'm checking some of this s_uff off. yes.
...
"okay. 000.44, 104.63, 359.69."
"odyssey, houston. we'd like you to, on your comm configuration, go to primary power amp off, low bit rate, and downvoice backup. over."
i'll take that and get this - going to use the camera. ll ll 51 26 i24p have a 9-hour rest period.
okay. that's got to be done right now. go ahead.
okay. it must have been 7.
"it's better than nothing, you know?"
roger.
roger. out.
huh?
okay.
"yes, that's right. we won't be able to call you on that. when it's down to 8 percent. tape76_/10"
"... doing? man, looks like ... dark as ever."
okay.
"okay. you described this big hole with a black blob, and the question is: is the big hole a crater, or does it look more like a volcanic vent? 06 02 11 26 cm? well, it looks to me like a - like a crater, like all the rest of the craters around here, except it occurs in the side of a - a crater wall. but - i've been looking for similar features, and there's quite a few of these big - real large craters that have similar size craters in their walls too. so i wouldn't say that's anomalous."
- -was it 30 seconds?
"okay. understand. stay for t-2, and go for the dps vent. let me get out of - okay, we can't hack that. i'm going to get out at 12."
"roger; copy. plus 77.6, plus 3.8, plus 3.1, tpf is 29."
112:02:4 - 40.92.
"okay, houston. challenger ... checkout is complete ... and we're looking at america, the beautiful."
you'd better believe it.
"yeah, i think you're right."
"okay, go ahead."
you know why i vacuum ...
"okay (yawning). you can start taking shots now, if you want. 05 22 52 42 lmip pardon?"
"*** diverter is in min; i'm going to pump, on."
okay. copy that.
"america, houston. we're about 3 minutes until los and everything is looking great. no changes since our go for doi. we'll expect to see you at 93:34:24."
and vertical on our diverter valve.
"okay. i think i got d-caldera awhile back with a 250 lens, too."
okay. change to time and - 1/60th.
negative. just curious.
"i've timed it myself, i only got up to 100. bet- ter check his gear."
... take that. (eagle ) 05 0_ 54 59 lmp how about that? (eagle )
src-2 is in my hand. the big bag is not required.
"i'll make it, i think. it's run off somewhere."
that's good.
o'kay. at your convenience we have an item to give you which will have to be copied. it's information on how to photograph comet bennett at time 32 hours get. over.
"okay, now. get the water ... down. l0 03 14 20 cml° i got to move the camera over - let's see if i can - -"
okay. i don't have it yet. 06 21 _5 08 cc okay. 06 21 45 10 l_lp-eva that's a21 a - okay.
*** 102 is the temperature.
now - well - i'm not -
the green light's on.
we'd like you to cycle the manual back to auto and see if that starts it back down. over.
okay. get the rcu ...
go.
"okay, i'm coming up on the edge of the kant plateau now and, from down here, that looks like a real steep rise. that's very impressive. but +here's nothing that's particularly significant abo',_:the topography or the texture, it just rises up."
"okay. we start on 2-1, right?"
"and you're with me. al, stick this over on your shelf. here. yes, i'll - i'll finish ... in a minute if you'll keep it - trapped."
"trouble is, there's too much backing up ... determine ..."
okay. okay. o0 04 31 59 ]_{p i'm happy with alinement here.
thank you. 04 17 41 07 _lv okay -
"hey, houston; orion. how do we look for aps tpi?"
"- - b. l, 2, 3."
may have to take these slopes just the most comfortable way we can.
you think that's van serg? right over there.
"apollo 13, houston. over."
"okay, skipper; 14 degrees. thank you."
can you get out all right?
"yes, but put your gnomon right over here, and we can get that for glass and that for subfloor."
"okay, here's the etb. how about handling that with care; there's a piece of fragile in there. i'll get it to you."
"that's good news, bob. we'll do that. and, gee, the sleeping up here is really good up here; and, _f y'all ever see another little problem like that, why, we'd be only to happy to roll over and take care of it. i think, as a matter of fact, we'a even sleep better if we knew that you wouldn't mind waking us."
roger. stand by.
we were afraid of that.
"and, al, if you read, we'd like to have your dse configured. 05 09 19 -- begin lunar rev 27"
"yes. let's see, houston, the walking hinges are unlocked again. is that right?"
we just crossed duke island and maskelyne w.
"okay. okay, about - at time 156:50 on the right - well, on the right-hand half of the page, there's a line which states ""visual target 16, south, 180 plus l:ll, gassendi, f:ls."" request you cross out that line."
"columbia, houston. that is correct."
one second.
yes ....
...
okay. you've got it.
"and, ken, your biomed data looks good now and i guess that's about all i got for you at aos. did you see anything on this last back side that is worthy of comment?"
go ahead.
got a - b is on.
"boy, that feels good."
go ahead.
"okay. l'i] do ths_t. 07 21 h3 24 cmp _at worked out real good with the rendezvous. ok_:,_, so now the pages i need to fix the times on are going to be - starting at page 323. 07 21 43 3h cc that's affirmative, and 2lb:g0 becomes - -"
yes. i got them - for you.
"yes, and you also - -"
okay.
"okay. wait a minute. that one is vertical. okay, that one is vertical - -"
no.
okay. i'll take my book.
"roger. 10 00 36 38 cml° okay. so out of that, i come up with a ""yes"" answer, and i'm going - looking at block 12."
okay. do they correlate with sizes?
"you know, that sps comes on a lot - -"
"okay, we're going to give you the high gain angle numbers and the verb 49 mane-_ver numbers _omorrow morning. they'll probably change on latest updates, so we won't give anything for the - you can just put three blanks for the roll, pitch, and yaw there with that verb 49 maneuver. okay, if you go down the page - -"

"do it right this time if it hurts. 162, ... son of bitch, beat you y_ going to get a ..."
yeah.
"._ud, jack, the computer's yours."
hl0 to plus all zeros.
- - crater.
we copy; 564 from the bottom of the boulder.
"i'll tell you, the old landing site stands out now. you couldn't miss that for anything. and it wasn't that obvious at the lower sun. unfortunately, i'm a little too far south to be able to give you a good answer on those terraces, but i'll give a hack at it."
the next one might be the last one (laughter).
"it looks like it went in here, i can't tell."
that right?
"okay. bob, this is a fairly uniform-looking rock. it does have some - widely spaced fractures across it. it's - clearly crystalline and has crystal- line inclusions in it."
"roger. understand. and if you'll give us auto on the high gain and accept, we'll send you up a state vector."
...
okay.
"no, we're not supposed to bring it back ...."
affirmative. c_ - - is just a little bit inside of it.
okay.
egress and egress.
"okay, circuit breakers eps group 5, two, close. that's the main a and main b, right?"
"no, i'm not looking into the sun."
okay.
coming up at you.
"roger, ken. the only thing scheduled is _hat p52 asout an hour from now."
"and, fredo, as we come up on lansberg here, it's - the terminator's running right across it. and it is a big one. it really has some - a stees rim - or rather a high rim, a very noticeably high rim for here - from - from here. and it's right - the terminator goes right through it. oh 08 22 22 cdr go ahead, houston."
"roger, mike. you can go ahead and arm your logic anytime you want to, and we'll give you a go so that you can get your pyro arm at your convenience."
"roger, dave - -"
"stop. follow the checklist, just as planned."
56 set it at. 04 13 19 21 _ 56.
"okay. 250, 000 - well, all zeros there. amp-hours 090, 092, 80, 85; and forward motor temps are lower limit - in the rear, lower limit."
"actually - okay, getting the other dac out."
roger. understand. we're looking at the wastebasket.
fine.
touch_.
okay.
"i don't know if that thing will last or not. no, i guess it was just black glass but it was the way the sun was reflecting off of it. isn't that too bad? anyway, that's a sample - and it's going in - bag 4 - 413. 'rape96/28"
"sounds like a good plan if you can work that out, jim."
"well, i'll have two of them back on at 3.5, pete."
(humming) have a sugar-cookie cube for a little energy. *** r-12's ...
stand by.
"okay, what do we have left here?"
"that's - okay, aquarius. we recommend omitting the dap set, gimbal/throttle test - just make sure the gim - deca power and deca gimbal cir- cuit breakers are closed. 02 13 01 33 i_mp okay, we're going to proceed now with the dap set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? or did you say delete it?"
it's closer to the ground than we are.
"hey, i'm getting this ... - -"
okay. we copy that.
okay.
"houston, 16."
"roger. we copy 720. thank you, fred - - 02 06 51 49 _ flashed to 7 - okay, and it just flickered down to 710. it's kind of flickering between 710 and 720."
"do you get the feeling that we're the only ones out here, jack? looking around - 073, 10.3, 6.6."
"okay. we'd like hf antenna 2 to off, please."
"let's %_y reacq, ron. you're in a skin reflecsion zone vhere, is probgoly zhe problem."
"i'm just wasting my time. i can't get it. i don't know how you can get in there and do it. i'll tell you what. i'm going off comm. charlie, watch the store and i'll get it. it makes me mad. 10 08 34 51 cml° ..."
no. thats all right. *** accurate later on. --
okay. i'll start on that.
roger.
"okay. on 275, circuit breakers main a, bat bus a, closed; main b, bat bus b, closed."
and that's due to trunnion trip.
"ignition, houston."
do it.
i've got to ...
"okay. whatever that means, charlie."
"go. okay, pull slowly. slowly so i can cap it all right. let me get a cap."
okay. apollo 11 air-to-ground voice transcription (goss net 1) tape 83/1
"(laughter) manischewitz. okay. let me see what i can do for you while i'm here. okay. lcru battery under seat, dustbrush to lcru. okay. i'll go get that; then i'll get to work."
"well, joe. i took a look when we were up there, and i couldn't see it."
"okay, jim. we got it. the earth went by at a minus 8 degrees. on a basis of the data - -"
okay. onfiden'-
did you get anything out of that little crater?
"okay. rcs alfa is 81 percent, rcs bravo 75 percent. coming up on ll5 hours get, descent oxygen is 31.8 pounds or 59 percent; descent amp hours 858, and ascent amp hours 574. over."
okay.
need some help?
i'm - i've already started it.
apparently this is not a very good 0m_i attitude for you. we're ready to start our ptc check.
that clast is soft.
"okay, jack, my only other concern now is the co2 rise in the spacecraft. i guess you're keeping a handle on ttat? , / ,,, w_ that"",; aff'i_ued, jim. w,, haw' you ti}* to 10.6 now, and we're willing .,og,oa litt]e l_igh,,_r on that. we have another cartridge ami we have a procedure for making the command module cartridges up. we'll pass that on later."
"and, for your information on planning, we're not going to reschedule any extra mapping camera or pan camera passes today to make up for what we missed yesterday. we're just going to go with the flight plan."
that's exactly what it was. 03 13 21 36 cml° are you going to help me ...?
"okay. that's all we got for you, and we have the e-mod dump okay."
putting them in the bag that goes into the src -
"gene, just before we get the lunar sound - say again - before we get the recording going again_ just remer_er you'll have to go m3lnual then wide in a normal acquisition at aos. and the ar_gies on the dial are correct."
but it's necessary.
"yes, go ahead. and be advised that your stars should be good as published."
"okay. preload the - it's pushing on by, so i'll going to - ... preloaded. c_ip okay."
"a_itares, houston. corem check; over."
"what was that, buzz, you're chasing now?"
looks like it's still open.
okay.
"okay, that's a good readback. lima is 113:14:24.91; maytro [?], 119:34:30.00_ and november is 114:57:19.09. and your t-2 at pdi - t-2 will be at pdi plus 24:33."
everything looked great (laughter) except we had all the lights on - -
two of them. 07 04 23 13 _ ...
"(clanking) no, i really guess not. okay, we'll just take one. okay, lm data file, huh? what should - what should be in it, jim? huh? yes. i know this is in it; i saw it the other day."
"casper, houston. how do you read now?"
that looks to me like that's fixed. you still show some residuals?
"well, we're just two little - two little sets of twinkletoes here. there's a lot that goes to getting this rover running out here that we don't have much to do with. and i guess there might be someone else that has something to do with it too, and i've been reading his signs, maybe not from him directly, but his in spirit, as we run up and down that ladder. and that's godspeed, the crew of apollo 17. and if he's listening, i'd like to thank him, too. pin i is pulled."
okay. roger.
cooling?
*** geno.
"well, they want another one."
will you get in -
"it might have been a window in the plains here, of some kind. but - it's strange to see it there with so much subfloor all around it that we saw."
roger. sorry to - -
"yes, we're at the same sun angle, and there's no doubt about it from tac_uet on up to mel something or other, there's a group of small rilles in there, and those rilles have got ejected material_ around and up and over the rilles. and not - not impact- type ejecta. it's got to be a volcanic ejecta of some kind up and around there. it's a dark broom - a darker brown, than the tan of serenitatis."
"go auvomatic update. 07 03 50 46 ia_p - - go ahead and automatic update· '}703 51 22 lmp okay, first one. going to be. .57. take that one. okay, second one. okay_ take that one. }7 i_ 51 56 cc' endeavor-, houston· the computer's yours. c7 03 51 57 chp roger. 07 c3 52 08 cc okay, f_lcon; houston. i have a msfn tpi for you and some words. d7 03 52 15 i_mp go ahead; i'm ready to copy the tpi, ed. _7-_'%3 52 22 cc i%'s an off-nominal tpi and angle. delta-_x, 66.3; delta-vy, plus 7·8; delta-vz, minus 31.2; total, 73.7. tpf delta-v will be 26.0. you're going to be pointed almost along the line of sight for tp!. you can omit the roll maneuver for tpi, your choice. and you will undoubtedly break lock."
"okay. yes, that's right. those are those - has- selblad things, since they're in there."
"okay, right side okay?"
"do you read down there, houston?"
"and, dave, that descent water was turned off on your plss recharge exercise."
roger. beautiful.
"well, i wouldn't be surprised but what a big im- pact crater wouldn't - wouldn't change your magnev- ic field some. 07 00 _3 23 lmp-eva tony, my impression right now could be proved totally wrong on the sample read - analysis, but -"
"hey, here's a big deep one here ... - -"
it's a little rocky out here.
"roger, houston; 13 here. reading you loud and clear."
mark.
you get in your corner again. oh 18 59 15 i_mp okay.
standing by for ullage.
"all right, we just took that back. it should be bravo and delta for spinup; alfa and bravo only for damping. copy bravo and delta for spinup; alfa and bravo for damping."
very good.
...
okay. i'll give you a mark - -
i'm already scared that jack will have it closed before i get up there.
"i will say one thing, though; no question in my mind but that they're there. last trip i took, i guess i just wasn't looking for them or paying any attention to them. maybe they were there and i ignored them because of other things. but they're there."
nobody knows. l0 00 48 33 cml° i can't tell.
"i hope the moon isn't in the way. oh 12 h7 30 cdr well, let me get that heater off again. the moon's not in the way. there's nothing but stars out there, buddy."
"roger, dave. was that from you?"
right .... to an early ending.
"okay, gordo, on the top of 1-15, we're ready to go ahead and transfer the power. we'll give you a call."
we're right on schedule .... to 3000.
locked. f
"go ahead, mike. over."
yes?
"yes, he's dumping waste water. it's about 15. yes. yes, straight up to relief, jack."
"good show, ron. amidyou want to bre_ here or {_o you want to take the lm sta_e vector verb 717 c?,? if you are through with the computer, i migh% stare the maneuver to attitude here."
yes.
"roger. we copy, and you're in sync with us."
i can see vhe lm in earthshine now.
charlie (laughter).
okay.
okay; have him give us a call when he gets ready.
"okay, vance. fred just tells me that he put it there, and we're checking that again about the pyro battery selector in the main position."
"okay. and on the next program, the ""manual range input,"" step 7 would be the same thing."
okay.
...
and one other point is that we'd like to remind you that this is going to be in blowdown and both regs b closed but we've got plenty at the 10 percent.
"okay, bob. here come the raps. knock three times. okay."
"- - for looking at the comet bennett, if you need it. _ 02 07 53 12 cmp okay. stand by. '_._, 02 07 55 19 lmp okay, houston - - _ _ 02 07 55 20 cdr i believe we've had a problem here."

"no. okay, coming soon though."
"okay. 05 00 13 55 i_p-eva sorry i blocked your picture there, tony."
"pressure regs to a and b, cabin, please."
"boy, this is - it's really rolling hills, joe. just like 14. up and down we go. oh, and this must be earthlight, huh? could that be? boy, look at that; we're going to have to do some fancy maneuvering here."
yes.
"yes, because we got a sextamt star check, as a matter of fact, so we do want the power on."
"roger. this is for your pad located at 196 plus 50. and it is t-start, 196:56:19. _"
"you know, i can't stay up any longer ... stayed up. i haven't slept but 2 hours every day since we've been up here."

"i guess my impression might be that some - at some places, we had some of each and - but most of it was from south ray. and around the lm, i'm - we saw - once we got going toward north ray, those - that material around the lm, by gosh, the breccia - and i collected several of thee at that last station- in hand specimens - some of them were like the material we got out of south ray, clear of south ray blanket, and - but several of them were from north ray. at least, that was my impression."
okay. lunar sounder operate is in standby. recorder is going on. radar is going on. recorder is gone off. off to center; not to heaters. and the mode is going to vhf.
"oh shoot! i see some - i see some striations in it, too. they may be my imagination."
no sweat.
"okay. ken, it's the back side of the lm. 07 09 14 53 cml° roger. i'm with you and i'll turn the dac on, and i'll a - fix the el ... station_keeping now."
"11, houston. we have you - your subspacecraft point is just off the western coast of south america directly south of about mexico city. over."
"()kay. ,jack, ]-a is reading, lower scale, o; 1-b is reading. 3.)t5. okay. you only want fuel cc]is 1 and 3. ()kay. ]gnore that, 1-b readinl_. ]-c is reading 3.4. now, 1-d is reading 2.1t. 2-d [s reading 0.25."
okay. do you have a real quick procedure how to (tranq) do that?
okay.
"copy that. l_p-eva okay. i'm going to leave it open, but don't let me - let me get -"
"okay, joe. i'm at the nav initilization site here."
"oh, that's ..."
"is halo crater a shallow crater, houston?"
i'm ready.
"now, the flood lights are on, right? no, i kind of don't think we need them though, do you?"
"you know, i want to take a picture upslope, dave, but i can't. i can't get the camera pointed up that way."
okay.
you ready to retract?
"and, jack, how's the visibility back at the center geophone ..."
okay.
could you tell?
"hey, ken, i've got a couple other words about that if you'd like to listen."
i can't budge it. i just cannot budge it.
"okay, dave, will you put these back in b-2 for me, please?"
"right. okay. next for the command module pic- tures, it may be a little hard to see the service module from the command module, but if you can see it, it will be through window 5, people down here think. recommend for that the cm 70- millimeter. these photos have priority 2. so this is 70-millimeter el, with - which has the 80-millimeter attached, and this is all in b-3. take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the 250-millimeter lens. and the 250-millimeter lens can be found in u-4. use cex film from a-13. ring sight from a-7, and these pictures will be f:8 at a 250th. and i think probably by now you probably all have - already have these cameras configured, and this may be redun- dant information, but here it is anyway. over."
"roger, dave. be advised that the alsep is picking up the rumble of the rover rolling across the plains."
"yeah, ken, i've - we've got that. i'd looked at _ it there a couple of days ago. a little blurb there i'd written in. it said the mark data was real consistent, and i think it was something like 33 kilometers, but i'm - let - let me check that out for you."
got her?
everything looks very good over here.
yeah. that's why - that's why the - the rake wouldn't go down.
"okay. and i got a 405 here, hank. light go away if i wait another minute?"
beautiful!
"okay. 01 22 5_ 12 lmp houston, 17."
"go ahead, endeavour."
this isn't the world's greatest place to - deploy an alsep. i'll tell you that.
"well, he's got squelch over _here, too - -"
"you know what i bet you did last night, joe? you let some of those marshall guys come up here and fix it, didn't you?"
"okay, yeah."
okay. i picked it up a little bit. how do you read now?
... i'm taking a pan.
7-n was the last one i put in.
that's in alignment only.
"i have; i thought you did, too."

okay.
okay. go ahead. we got a lot of scratch paper.
"huh? oh, that's good .... so_mds all right."
"okay, that's fine. yeah, _harlie. after your 500 millimeter - - 06 22 56 28 l_-eva tony, do you still want me to get - -"

you're right. let's do that.
okay. that ought to be in the site. 07 01 18 19 immp-eva right. now down a little bit. that ought to be it.
how about plus?

roger. 08 03 23 23 c_2a boom clear.
that sounds great. we hope we can provide them with as much education as we can entertainment.
"okay, we copy."
"roger. the - the _-anges that you have are a iittl bit in error. i'd like to give you the correct ones, so that when you compare your ranging, it'll look more better to you. 07 05 39 46 cmld you mean the nominal ranges in the rendezvous profile?"
"i'm gonna leave the nitrogen in the - in the hatch. ,, we're gonna pu_p that when we get back. i talked to the guys about that."
"okay, now. here's the picture to show where the top rock came out. charlie, i got it!"
okay. good show. you fellows are really getting smooth.
"america, houston. we may have not been looking at the xight displays at the right time, but we didn't see an 02 purge. did you do 02 fuel cell purge?"
"man, there's the lunar surface."
"okay, ken, i'll - we'll talk about the platform problem first, and i'm gonna back up and talk about the original data that we passed up because there are some small corrections to that. and then i'll - i'll try to break it down into about four shovelfuls here for you, because it's a fairly big mouthful if we try to do it all at once. 02 02 3h 50 cm2d okay. you have some stuff that i probably should copy, huh?"
"two, off."
"what happened, dick, is beyond n_ff comprehension."
that camera's still warm.
roger. as per the checklist.
"yes. roger, ron. we're copying everything you're saying, and we've got all kinds of support here; we - in fact, we've got one backup unit here watching what you're doing, so we'll keep you posted on what we think. cml° oh, okay. is the backup cmp operating it?"
"and, america, the cabin is at 3 psi."
okay. i'd give - give it few clicks. you're through 200 feet - -
pitch 1 is off. servos 1 and 2 are off.
you ought to get over here.
"and the hard part is over, once you acquire them at that low elevation. in fact, the elevation is as difficult as - any sort of sun problem. that wculd be here, as we go - go towards the zero- phase; i guess it's probably still about 08:h0 and i'd guess about 40 minutes to go. it's still hanging in there right now. no - no problem at all. particularly b, it's - it hasn't the - the bright surface on the center across the crater - tkat makes it that much easier. let's see, i can see the zero-phase. and i guess the camera was pointing at it as we get up here closer. and i es_ see zero-phase now, approaching target a, so tkis should be a - a good test. been no problem to acquire up to now. 04 16 04 39 cml_ there's zero-phase just about on a, and the camera took the picture. okay, we went through zero- pkase on a with - with no problem - hanging on to tile landmark itself."
"that's probably - he didn't ever call the - i'll ask fao here, but i don't think he ever called the actual - coordinates on it. i'll ask fao. that's probably close enough. they'll probably all be in the picture anyway, wouldn't it?"
"and, houston, is magazine ii a good one to use for a - some opportunity interior photos?"
"roger, dave. there's a lot of information right there."
okay. enter. ail zips.
move the lec out to you.
look what's underneath it.
"okay, houston. we got a good sep."
"and i'll give you general pointing, and you can try your - your big dish."
okay.
"well, i feel lots better. like i told you, geno - i think that you were the jinx on gemini 9 for all the delays. over."

"yeah. okay; you're - we still showed you with 2 feet a second. you still got it, man. o4 o5 14 3o cmp okay."
okay. dust cover is co-¢ering it.

okay; exactly 13 seconds.

"there was no doubt in your mind of lift-off, i was a little surprised at the level of the vibration prior to lift-off though. i'd been led to believe it was probably worse. maybe they're strapping us in tighter nowadays."
"no, sir."
"okay, john and charlie. we'd like you to press on with the - the eva work. if we mess with that s-band any more, we'll do after the eva. i've got a note here. i don't know whether it's right or not, but it says that you won't be able to hear the yaw motor."
okay. p47.
it's on your plss.
"okay, good. f"
i feel the same way. i think you had the worst of it.
does that help?
"tony, that's - that is a double muley - that rock."
right. get rid of all my tools.
another y?
"okay, press on through them all now."
"loud and clear, ken."
"yes. what did i say? 230 on that? yes, bearing is 230/2.2, and i'm parked on a heading of 320, which gives you a better view."
"yes, i just lost the sample. it's in my pocket, i guess. let me get some tongs."
"houston, aquarius."
"okay. you've got po0 and accept, and direct, off.."
"yes, sir."
"boy, don't drop any of those connectors on the - -"
"okay, jack. yo_ can get _o_r 02 on."
"well, we can't land there."
feels good in the back?
"just stuck my head out the window. i've got to find it. there it is, right here."
"if you don't have it off, we could stop amd get off and get it, if you want to? bu% this is a short distance. you might want to carry this one."
"you want these mesa heaters on hi, houston?"
"i'm reading you, fred. i've got a lot oi'ba{_i{- ground noise. looks like it might come and go with attitude. 03 13 03 5h lmp yes. i think that's probably - just looking through the command module at you now."
"loud and clear. 04 18 59 23 _ the horizon that you see in this view is the north flank leading up to cone crater. it's proba - it's over a mile away - a mile and a half away. i'll give a quick zoom in on it. and then i can't gc any closer to the sun right now. i'm at my limit. age tconfidentiat, ll 04 18 59 39 cdb okay, we're - -"

"jim, you're loud and clear, and we're ready down here if you are."
"no, i'd rather straddle or go through those little ones."
"okay, good."
"roger, ken. before you do this, would you check y_w real carefully. we're showing about a de- gree difference between the iss att and the icdus."
"no, i'm - i feel good. *** know how good i look."
"i got it so tight now, the rover - okay, now."
"i'll give it a try. wait for me there, just a second ..."
"should be up, forward. little far out. they _oli us we'd be a little far out in front. that's okay. here plot it on there. put that mark on there. that's good data for those fellows. o'r'ok 54 35 i_p okay."
"11.9, okay. 06 o0 29 57 cml° ... point zero, plus 1.7, plus 7.1."
yeah. i think you're right.

and leave the brackets for the lioh canister.
"which one are you looking at, al?"
"bob, *** gene, and i'm on the surface and as i take man's last steps from the surface, back hc_e, for some time to come, but we believe not too long in- to the future. *** just list *** believe *** will record that america's challenge of today *** forged man's destiny *** tomorrow. *** as we leave the moon at taurus-littrow, we leave as we came and, god willing, as we shall return, *** peace and hope *** all mankind. godspeed the crew of apollo 17."
"okay. i got the lmp's camera. nothing in here but couple of old bags. we used about all the bags we had, jack. not many here. bob, i have the dust brush tethered."
go ahead.
"go ahead, tli plus 5."

- .-you said it all.
... point - -
okay. stand - -
"okay. side hatch dump valve, close."
okay.
"roger. if you concur, we would be inclined to re- commend that you go to ags for the maneuver because you'll have to be there later on anyway."
"..... 17.9 and ... okay, so that's distance, right?"
roger. the burn was nominal. we had - we just saw you rise.
"okay, jack, i will do. jim and i were able to spot constellations from the windows of the lm when there's no venting taking place. could you give me some time on these consumables, what you're predicting they're good for? i think you started to give them times, didn't you, or was i just hearing things. 04 ]0 36 56 cc we started to give you some t_mes. we think we might be able to give you some better ones pretty soon. but it looks like your water is good through 15_ hours, and you've got takusan 02 through o7o _..... ____._ _ _,__ .......... and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199 or 200 hours. over."
"and, gordy, be advised that you're clipping on your first word."
"well, i'll tell you what. i'll be very careful. wonder if i could cut that microphone off."
let's see - -

"resetting the nav system. 06 23 27 06 ia{p-eva okay, dave, i'll get the gate for you and you'll be ready to go."
"yes, sir."
okay. that's all we've got.
yes. i keep floating up in - -
roger.
we're looking at minus 10 on the delta-v c.
"okay, the next item - we are wondering if you got the screens on the suit hoses. those screens are normally stored in the pga bags during launch and we don't know whether you ever got those on or not. if you didn't, you can put those on and get increased circulation in the cockpit, there."
"houston, i think i put the wrong number in on the pitch. we'll correct it. it's 228, isn't it?"
it's getting there. it's going good. how does it feel? l0 04 26 01 _ feels great.
"i was going to say, using your terminator time as a partial - mark for where hawaii ought to be, hawaii ought to be, it looks like that cyclonic circulation at the north end of the cloud bank i described, approaching that area, would be just about on the hawa - hawaiian islands. i'm curious if they're getting some weather down there now."
"how's the pictures going, ron?"
"okay, 13. that's a pretty good picture there."
"well, the - these extension hoses would _ke it better, charlie ... - -"
they're installed.
"okay. and if you've got something - if you don't have one left for that sample at hole-in-the-wall, jack, we'd like you to get a new set of sample bags."
arm is off.
"345 ... 06 22 15 ih lmp-eva yeah. now at 0.8, you can vurn to about 356."
"yeah, ..."
"gordo. in answer to pp's [?] question about %he color of the maria down there, when you look at serenitatis, of course we saw this earlier, when we were much closer, but when you look a% it from up here, it's - it's got on the northeast side, a very - quite thick, laterally across %he surface, dark - typically dark with %he tannish colors i was talking about - mare - which sort of lorders it. but just north of the - the overla_, between tranquility and serenita_is, that con_ac_ c}_es sharply to a - the grays are gone - it'_ a vary sharp contrast and i think those who ?lave see_ _t before will remember it, but serenitatis from where we stand is - much more tan dominated, than gray dominated."
okay. i'm glad i didn't have to earlier in the week.
"well, let's align the scs like we did before. l0 ob 23 50 l_p do it just like you've been doing except torque - except pulse torquing. why don't you do that?"
"charlie, i can hear you talking, but i can't copy it. 04 22 10 2_ cdr-lm ... can you hear me, tony?"

"okay; and, l?, we'd like -"
okay. is that our waste water tank?
"yes. yes, i kind of glanced up and saw that disappear."
"okay, stand by 1 sec."
"let me wait until i get a good startup on mine, dave."
"okay, john. we got 4 hours and 15 minutes or so."
all righty. go.
"fair. boy, that ... - -"
"yes, i want to make sure it is, because i'll need it out there. ia{p-eva no, wait a minute. i don't know that it's there now."
"s8_ again there, jack."
"sps helium valves, two of them, to auto."
"okay, i'm on my way to the experiment. charlie, can you hold my feet there? and would somebody give me a call at 107"
"okay. the - you want to do that after - line 13, or before that?"
"okay. in general, let me tell you also that your rcs is 4.7 above the flight plan. and, just as a summary, unless you want to plo_ _hem, i'ii just tell you that the oxygen and the hmdrogen are doing good things. and you've gov plenty of iv. and i'm ready to give you a - the first pad will be a trim rcs burn and the second ane will ze the plane change burn."
- - we did that when we doffed the suits yesterday as best we could.
what are you doing?
roger.
roger.
let me check.
"roger, houston. i've been in delta the whole (columbia) time but it doesn't ..."
"i do; we have that one, karl."
okay. go to operate -
i'm going up there.
"man, we're sinking in - -"
bet you life you do.
"i say, do you want me to verify that dse or do you want me to configure?"
"okay, ken. go back to auto."
"boy, i drove a nice core tube in there."
"and we need the suit circuit relief valve back to auto. correctson, back to close."
okay. it looks like our reading is getting kind of close to yours.
getting your - your setting changed fast enough?
"i'll just take it off of here, huh? cml° yes, just right off there."
"i got to get the gimbal angles on that ... man, i yawed that bastard around about 35 degrees; i pitched; i rolled. i was really wheeling and dealing."
"okay. first six on the left are closed - that's through the isol valve, but i opened up every one from there on."
"i've got the lm in sight to my 10 o'clock. you know what i feel like, al?"
"good morning, good morning down there."
okay. you don't have it nulled. that's - you've got full ...
"okay, stow the s_pply hose which is - - 05 06 33 _5 cur-ir you can't move. 05 06 33 _8 lmp-lm go_ that's the wrong way. i want - they want us to stow th_q thing, but i guess we could leave that out. 05 06 33 53 cdr-ir what's that? 05 06 33 5_ lmp-lm that's the supply hose. 05 06 33 56 cdr-ir oh, i'll stow it. _ i 05 06 33 57 lmp-ir okay'. 05 06 3_ 02 cdti-lm shoot, ch-wlie. all you gotta ask - do is ask. i'll _-,_t i aim't paying any attention, but you might as well ask an_ how. 05 06 3_ 08 lmp-lm (laughter) 05 06 3_ 19 cdr-ir that _s - that was really something else. 05 06 3_ 35 i_mp-lm okay, disconnect ops actuator frc_ rcu; disconnect ruu from pga. 05 06 3_ hl cdr-ir there you go. 05 06 34 _2 lmp-ir okay. 05 06 3_ 52 cdr-lm it's that thing right there. 05 06 3_ 5_ lmp-lm wait a minute, john. before i do this i, got a wet rag over here. i'm gonna wipe that rcu off before i put it anywhere. \ i"
roger x-ray to standby.
"it - if i ever saw a classic alteration halo around a volcanic crater, this is it. it's ellipsoidal. it appears to be zoned. there's one sample we didn't get. we didn't get the more yellowy stuff, we got the center portion -"
"charlie, that fuel follows delta-p of 50, oxidizer follows delta-p of 12. that was the answer i got back on that; however, on the example you gave, i thought you were right with it, except on the sec- ond part. it looked like to me you need a 12 dif- ference there. i might of misread the thing. 02 20 14 24 ia{p okay. i was just looking at my gages here, i've got about 190 oxidizer pressure, and about 165 fuel pressure. and so that says to me that the fuel side could go up to 178 and i'd still be within the limit."
okay; let me just look at that one.
"that put all the major cities of the south, perth and adelaide, at least, and melbourne, certainly in the clear. and in the north darwin, in those areas, are very nicely clear today."
okay. i copy that.
yes. get it?
"it never really stabilized though, hank. 03 07 i1 59 cc okay."
"okay, al. first of all, on the g,mma ray boom, the reason for that, is the fact that we're getting a little gain change every time that we deploy and retract it. it's not serious, but we'd like to sort of leave it as it is until we study the prob- lem a little longer. you've already deleted the extension at 120:33. we also, then, will delete _ the retraction at /21:27."
beg your pardon?

"yeah, i - i guess we would concur with that funny sense of humor. we had some guys here laugh all night."
"bob, while we've got a quite moment here, as i go to de - deploy that ep charge, i'd just like to say that any part of apollo 17, or any part of apollo, that has been a success thus far is prob- ably, for the most part, due to the thousands of people in the aerospace industry who have given a great deal, besides dedication and besides effort and besides professionalism, to make it all a reality. and i would just like to thank them, because what we've done here and what has been done in the past - as a matter of fact, what has been done for 200 years, you've got to contribute to the spirit of a group of people who form the aerospace industry. and i god bless you and thank you."

"okay. but we're going to have to make a configura- tion setting before we start the eva, because we won't be able to get to it then. if we can find a' place where it looks good, i'd like to leave it in manual throughout the eva, and we can try the auto feature some other time."
"yes, that probably wouldn't have crumbled them as badly."
okay.
"hey, why don't you turn around, jim?"
go ahead.
look at this.
"houston, 15. we're down to the middle of the tli prep, and everything's in order."

"casper, houston. i'd like to remind you to get your rhc direct power off."
the third question is for cernan or schmitt. your voices are so much alike that it is unclear to some of us which one of you found the orange rock and who first spotted the layer of orange soil on the crater rim.
you caught us at dessert.
"yes, sir. we're on our way, bob. that takes care of it. knock your feet off, jack. knock your feet off on the ladder."

that's right.
"oh, yes. that was pretty."
roger.
"okay, bob. i'm going down the ladder."
"i think we can find a good site. we may be a little closer to doublet than the - than the map shows, because of the grade going up there; but i think there's a level site fairly close to the south rim of doublet, and we'll aim the camera in that general direction and give you 150 zoom. focus at infinity."

how much do you want me to - how much do you want me to rock it? how far should i let the bubble travel?
"what the hell happened to the reset - the - we're not going back to 10 010, are we?"

"- - we've decided it's about time you start on your station 8 trench, if you would, please."
okay.

"okay, joe. i'll stand by for your suggestions."
yeah.
"hey, bob, just as we stopped the rover, i went on aux water. do you want me to turn n_fprimary water off - i don't have to, do i?"
"yes. we're just going to move to the area, where we could stop and case the joint. al, grab a shot of that headed glass there and we'll hag it."
huh?
"no problem, dave. the down position."
yes. you might just watch it if you're there. ... al's moving over.
okay. when did you say this happened with respect to our exercise period?
*** let me get an after of that.

you're the same.
"houston, 15. we're coming up to serenitatis, and it really looks like an ocean. the landforms, as we approach, are very rugged, very highly cratered, rounded, and we get to the shoreline and we see a few wrinkle ridges that have smoothed out. and we can see, on the far side on the horizon, the mountains which pick up again on the western side of serenitatis."

look pretty good under that ...
okay; understand plus 7 and 250 on the high gain.
"pete, yankee clipper looks real good. he's been doing p22's and rolling right off."
"roger. if you're ready, chariie, i'll read you the ags abort constants."
"so are you guys, jack."
"roger, falcon; houston. loud and clear. and when you're up and ready to converse, let me know. 05 18 04 ll cdr-imm okay, gordo. will do."
"i don't think that that question of who found it is as specifically as important as that that we were there with the equipment and the training jointly to not only recognize that but to take advantage of having recognized it, and i hope that we did. $"
"okay, very good. oh, yes, i wanted to tell you a little bit about the landing site there - on the - on the craters. there's a - earthlight crater, of course, is a lot sharper than index. and then there's a great big one to the east of index, which is the same size and quite sharp, and i think - you won't have any trouble as long as you see the matthew, mark, luke, and index. index is a pretty subtle crater, and there probably won't be much shadow in the bottom of it at all, when you get there."
get it with this real easy. here's a whole big - we ought to take that just as is.
"okay. verb 49, yaw plus 27100, pitch plus 35500, roll plus 33000. and do you think it's cheaper to manually make that maneuver or take the 0.2- degree range and go in auto maneuver?"
"the top part's almost a red, a dark red, and the bottom is an orange."
"mark; gene. streak from the upper right, of the right eye, down to about the middle."
okay. i'll leave it p20.

"roger. well, i'll continue this maneuver then (columbia) to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you: and do a p52 in that attitude. and that'll be a sleep ..."
(laughter) ... do you want to use this place up here for them?
"we can do this all from up in the cockpit. what we're gonna do - and i don't want you to do it now - but what we're gonna do is put it in auto, and eecom will sit here and watch the flow-rate change, and when we a - get to a certain lead point on what we think is the desired flow rate, he'll cue me, and i'll cue you, and we'll go to manual."

"okay, joe, the battery management complete. how does the rest of the spacecraft look, what you can see of it?"
"16, houston. it appears to us that the input channel bit just cleared. did you do anything?"
"it starts - well, the first one's at 5 minutes and then we go 6:40 and every l0 seconds after that. okay?"

"charlie, this is a pretty good rock."
"so you can go to attitude hold there, jim."
"hello, houston. how do you read? over."
"okay, and on the ecs, the failure mode's probably in the convrol electronics. the valve was driving at max rate - that's 12 seconds, full open to full close, and they saw that on tm by the flow rate. i don't recon_nend making any extensive changes since that doesn't seem to be the problem, and thermal runs are being made here at this time to determine the settings for lunar orbit. they don't anticipate any problems with it."
"and, falcon; houston. we're having changeover down here; didn't get a chance to say real good job on that descent."

"okay. except i don't have a camera, so i can't do anything. i'll go look - go look."
"roger. and if the rover's fairly level, we'll give you a nav update - later on."
go -ahead.
yeah.
roger.
"intrepid, houston. no transients."
"okay, gordy. let me say once again, way back when we first started and gene was talking to you, i heard one of your answers, weak but clear, with zero signal strength showing here. now, that might have been through ron's vox, i don't know. since then, you've been able to modulate the signal strength, with occasional weak words. and - and then, when that signal strength was up around 3.2, where it is now, then you came in loud and clear with a broadcast. i answered you, you said about three words, then dropped off completely. and then we - we changed configuration."
outstanding.
"no, we don't, because then we don't want that hatch to get closed. 04 18 22 09 lmap-lm you got to turn around here. oh, boy!"
"roger. if you are ready down there, i'll go ahead and retract the mapping camera now. if you want to watch the data."
did it - the - -
"roger, ron. apparently in your preflight data base they show you with a rate of in the low 60's or high 50's, that's a sleeping rate. and we're showing you now, during your sleep periods, of heart rates of about l0 beats lower per minute. and with heart rates that show less variation than the preflight data shows."

"oh, okay. well, there's a little dust on the central mirror. but the other two seem to be fairly clean. i just happen to have a camera, which i'll take a picture for you."
7:50.
we copied about a maximum of about 118 - -
sure is ...
there are a few out there.
"okay. because there's quite a difference be- tween the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants, but with inaccurate state vector, i'm inclined not to believe the program."
okay.
"we saw that one, too, bob."
okay. we'll - we'll ask that question. stand by.

"okay, you got those 16s? got another pack like that of 167 you don't say, that's all the film? sure took a lot more than that out of here."
we just ate a can of ham salad and that was an experience.

yeah.
"al, we're going to change your mapping camera procedures. i'm going to call them to you on time rather than read them to you now. so press on, and i'll give you a warning here in about 5 or 6 minutes."
"yes, sir. 05 02 33 19 i24p-eva that'd be a good one. but it looks awful rough up there, doesn't it?"

"w_ll, there's dust. that's one thing that's in there."

yes.
don't trip.

"okay. houston, can you give us a call at 3.25?"

hello there.
"okay, jack. it looks like we've closed up the loose ends here. amazingly enough, out of all that stuff, it looks like we only generated one question on the floor, and we'll research that one. we'll even let you guess what it might have been. if you have any questions, after you mull it over, why, we're always available. just ask us what you're thinking about."
*** wait a minute.
that's better.
they're not? 08 04 14 21 ih5° is that right?
"no. oh, boy. oh, boy."
okay.
"okay, just a minute."
"the walls of these craters, the big craters around here, that is, the ones that are, say, 15 meters in diameter, tend to be a little bit lighter albedo *** down in the mantled area. i'm afraid those pictures on that rake may be a little bit made - be through a dust-colored lens."
okay. mark that.
get it out this window.
"thank you, sir."
"john, after you went back to normal configuration, did you drive it?"
"hey, geno."
"no, in _he sim bay."
"okay. we're headed that way, and there's a some beauti - those white rocks are - -"

that's nice to hear.

got it.
okay.
"houston, endeavour is up on high gain."
"no. about the only other thing i've got, ken, is your - your temperature for the sleep period. i guess there are a couple of things we could do, like we could leave some power on to increase the load, or we could try to move the t_ in _lve or we could - i guess you don't have any - 05 08 21 57 cnp i'm sorry. i wasn't meaning to be complaining. i was merely wanting to record a remark that there was a significant change in the cabin. sometime starting yesterday, sometime, and i don't know when - compared to what we had had. and that was not something that i was asking for relief on. it's very comfortable."
understand 370.
okeydoke.
what?
"good night, james. i'm keeping your sleeping bag warm for you, jim."
okay. we'll bump up the cabin and then get a little - master alarm.

"that's correct, dave, and we're standing by for the other additions you've made, now."
and about 5850 on cdr.
i don't think that's worth a damn anyhow. okay. give me a 37 one.
okay.
"mark it. oh, hf-2? gordy, i started 1. i'm sorry."
okay.
sorry about that. i had - only had 9/loths resid- ual in x and i - i trimmed it out. that short burn constant made it a lot better.
"plus 190, plus 87 -"
"- - battery covers - up front there, why don't you go back and give us that temperature reading and then put the breakers in and then give us another temperature reading on the batteries."
"okay, ron. how is - how is your suit pressure?"
okay. ed grindell was shaking his head for a minute. now he says as long as you're working that way.
"yes, i lost both those guys. they - they decided they wanted to sleep, and i may be rumbling around here for a while but i took - we all three took seconal, so i think we'll get to sleep before long."
roger. i think i've got you on high gain now. (eagle )
"houston, endeavour. if you're copying the dsky, the gyro torque angles are up."
"we just aim to please, john."
roger. copy the next two deletions also. go.
"yeah, we'll get it."
yeah. ah-h-hl
mark.
"roger, buzz. we'd like you to place the s-band antenna omni a switch to the bravo position. s-band antenna omni switch to the omni position, the high gain track to _nual, and the high gain angles will be yaw 270, pitch minus 50. over."
"read you loud and clear, fred. how do you read?"
okay; leave it on. we can don our gloves now.
okay; f/22 and peak. how does that look to you?
"okay, we understand your water flags are cleared."
copy that.
"that's correct. okay, and then we'll do - -"
"okay, joe. go ahead."
still got an 02 on the lmp.
"roger. it will be deployed at the same location we were originally planning on deploying it, which was in the checklist there."
plug that hole. we can either - we can put some either - let's cut a piece of your towel there.
"jim, is my spoon up there somewhere? spoon. yes, it should be back in there."
"in this lighting, you can see the crater descartes, and it stands out much bid_ker thanyou wouldexpect .. because of the low sun angle. and - in fact i had to look in to my map in order to make sure that was what i was lookin$ at. _and the material that . runs out of it - that - that's in the area, are the things we talk about as being that bright reflective area, in this low sun angle, has a much blockier and jumbled appearance than it does on any of the high-sun photographs."
"for future reference, bob, the dome removal tool doesn't - it'll turn. shoot."
"we're burning; we're burning. we're burning now, dick. how do you hear? burning good."
"yes, i did."
all right.
"houston, you copy 137"
okay; my right - right glove is or and locked. verified.
"1.2, you guys. 41."
okay. you can feel that rim all the way around. wait a minute.
"pitch of plus 25, yaw, 200; and reacq and narrow."
you monitoring right now?
"okay. there you go. unstow your boors, purge valve to purse, stow iv gloves in boot bottom compartment."
"okay. retract, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and about 10, i guess. okay, then i'm going to -"
"hey, john - nothing."
"okay, the pi says that's okay, and we should go ahead and proceed."
here comes your exhaust .... 2 and 3.
"yes. you're right. i've been taking stills, and i let it get out of view of tv. i got to get you back."
"oh, i don't really think there's any future in that."
- - up there is the same.
"... gee, charlie. 06 04 14 52 hmp-eva look at that soil! it's all cake looking, isn't _ it"

okay. you have accept.
some of your experts might - -
"okay. landing radar, closed."
"circuit breaker, pitch 1, yaw 1. i sure got that. 03 02 36 24 cmp/cdr okay, did we get all that?"
we're going.
okay.
"yeah. well, what i would like to do is to find out if we've lost that loop. like right now, even if - even if the gimbals ..., i'm not sure i would be willing to try to get the coarse align."
"dave, an extraordinary television picture here."
0keydoke. sounds great.
looks broken to me now.
"attitude monitor, pgns."
okay. go ahead on primaries.
okay. let me _oint a little bit further around that way.
how do our consumables look today?
we - we will.
we sure are.

"most of the - most of the spoon bowl packs you know - or wet packs, whereas the juice bags won't do it."
mark.
give me a mark.
"john, let me suggest something. let me hold it - the frame - and you pull on it."
"at 218:10, delete ""mapping camera image motion, increase."""
... an hour and a half.
"roger. l_ alsc_ vhe norvh boundary of the carpathian massifs has a vepy shaz_ply defined high lava marks - and if that's actur_ly what we're seeing. and in - i'll mark the place on the map, but it looks like i_ extends goout a sixth to an eighth of the way up the highest peak. it's quite a striking and ob- vious mark. there's a major textural change - below the mark of a little scarp that defines it, the texture is very smooth. above that it has the lineated and typical mountain front texture for the apennine - for the imbrium range."
"okay. could you repeat that, please?"

"tunnel lights, coming on."
you really need to do that. you can't just ...
"open. 00 00 28 21 _l _ _ergency cabin press, select closed."
roger. and you're both loud and clear.
okay. i can't see a thing except the lm there.
mike goes in the temporary stowage bag; qq goes on with 104 frames. that's going to be window 3.
you've got black and white left ...
this one's been used.
"yankee clipper, houston. go ahead."
white clast in there. a little bit more; keep coming. good job.
"amd, challenger, it's your computer now. iafp-lm thank you."
"if we went to - if we get out of this dumb egress mode, we're not going to - certainly the cabin isn't going to fail, now. we've been in and out - let's get. i'm in cabin right now."
"of course, they're different slopes, too."
i'm going to go over and start getting out of my suit then.
"right at the moment anyway. right at the moment anyway, is to be out there and watching this space- craft maneuver in attitude and - and watch it burn over the lunar surface. i get the feeling someone is watching."
"17, we'll think about that until you go los."
"excuse me, gene. i_p what can i do to help you?"
"apollo 11, this is houston. over."
"i should think he'd be a little bit behind you, right? ron, i'll take that back, i think he is in front of you."
i'll need the pro.
"if you're getting high bit data, we could do an off/reset and go back on on battery 2. we're standing by for that."
okay.
- - and you're in jets.
"and, houston, tranquility base is going to give (tranq) you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. we are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. that's'not universally true. there are - there are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. the ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. i'd say the thing that would be most like it on earth is powdered graphite. immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. as i said, i've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. and the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. and in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass. 05 ob 12 55 cc tranquility, houston. roger. very fine description. 05 ob lb 05 cdr i suspect this boulder field may have some of its (tranq) origin with this large sharp-edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. now yesterday i said that was about the size of a football field, and i have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. but i thought that it might just fit in the astro- dome as we came by it. and the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. over. (goss net 1) tape 79/11"
"okay. and you want 5 to fill it up. okay, bob -"
mine's okay.
okay. the pressure looked good there. we'd like that breaker back open. the master alarm you have is normal.
want to move on around there about l0 feet or so?
"thank you, sir."
"okay, thank you."
...
put them in this htc right here.
"okay, i'll whip into a little p52 here."
"aridyou'd better get your camera set up, ken, for the terminator photos."
okay; we sure do.
ready to copy.
"roger. for your information, jack - -"
yes.
yes. this other way - you are in the way there. let's go the other way.
"what did you get, ken?"
okay.
"*** snaps came open there, i guess."
it's 250 millimeters. same settings?
"okay, ken. we did a recycle. we're looking at 78.0, plus 2.7, a minus 0.2 on the pgns."
"yes, jack."
"- - we'll switch omnis ... hold off a minute, 16; we'll switch omnis."
"yes, that's affirmative, geno. you have a go for tunnel vent valve, vent."
okay.
"- - it's 210:11 - 230:11. try another one, 231:11."
okay; fine.
that's a little harder to pull shut than i - -
"no, i mean it. i don't necessarily have to be ..."
i bet we dock and come home in about 3 hours.
"no, they don't have the same velocity. they just sort of sublimating out of there. the other ones were coming out like a rifle shot."
"it's either in my little stowage compartment or i gave it to you. i don't remember which one, dick. i always - i always keep the pad in that little metal box by my right shoulder."
that's probably is the - -
"man, when that thing started to shake (laughter) -"
"as a matter of fact, vance, i find my - i find fred down there all the time. g1 07 o0 44 cc yes. i can see he appreciates that. looks fairly comfortable."
okay.
"wait a minute. i got to get the tapes, john. i want to make sure i got everything. okay, pull left pin, pull reel, pull saddle release. okay. here's the saddle release coming down ... outstanding!"
don't move.
0k_y. 06 23 52 15 cml° then do an scs; then i'll call 509; and then i'll take 509 down and i'll use the modified card where i start at gimbals - bring the bus ties on at 8 minutes.
*** last time we want to have to - open that.
where?
"you know you look at - next to macrobius a, there is a lind of a dark halo-type crater there. very small one. and it doesn't have the appearance of a h_,mmocky crater rim to it, at all. it looks like the material just kind of spreads out all over the area, but it doesn't have a h_mmocky appearance to it. i'm going to take a look at that again when i come back - on back around on the other side. there's a small mound down in the bottom of the crater, also. it's a domical- shaped structure in the bottom of that small cra- ter. it's right next to j3. north of j3."
okay; let me look at something here (laughter).
"roger, neil and buzz. let's press on with getting the closeup camera magazine and closing out of the sample return container. we're running a little low on time."
"i was wondering about the albedo on your surface chart, on the strips and things, whether the ray - the rays are as obvious as they are on the high sun angle chart that you're carrying, or whether they look very much different at the low sun angle."
"roger. and for your p52 and optics calibration, it'll be roll 346.5, pitch 345.0, an_ yaw 007.8. over. 00 04 46 44 c,_p roger. 346.5, 345.0, and 007.8. th_mk you. 00 04 46 49 c( houston. roger. out."
okay. we've been thinking about the - the busted snoopy hat and have a suggestion on a - on a con- figuration that we'd like to present to you as an alternative to the plan you mentioned earlier. see what you think about it.
right on.
"honeysuckle, houston. coremtest. loud and clear. how do you read?"
yep.
"okay, hank at - at arm's distance, if you cup your fingers around it, it's about as big as a 50-cent piece. but you can sure tell that it's changed size for the smaller, but we still feel like we're pretty close to it. like i - i don't how far away from it we are, but probably about maybe 25 - 30,000 miles."
"3_1,houston. we're handin?, over c0_4 to ,_oldstone. over. correction, from goldstone %o honeysuckle. over."
then i'm going to go get the can.
get it all packed? here. _ day 5 page 175 day 5
"gordy, never mind. i think i got the gist of it."

"roger, all we copy. and at ... minutes into the va - eva, you're pretty close to the nominal time line."
"no, it was - it was on and running, ron. and then all of a sudden, about 5 minutes ago, we got just a complete belly up; no power to it at all."
yes. 35. just a second. i'm going to get it - -
...
"just putting these batteries in. i'm done on this. oh, you'll be glad to hear this. we got 70 orl battery 1 and about 92 on battery 2."
"okay, and i'm going into the landing radar check again."
the place you can really see it is where it's re- flected off the slopes of the - or the - -

"okay. and let me make a small trim maneuver. looks like it should be less than a half degree, unless you'd like to just leave it alone. either way."
"okay. with the sextant photo test here, we have a call for a pcm cable, and the only ones we have on board will not reach the connectors over by the right-hand girth shelf. do you have any suggestions on how we can get the dac connected to the pcm?"
"yeah. yeah, that will be ... - -"

"oh, ron, we've been kicking around this ems test and the null bias test and that, and we concur on this burn using noun 85s and your burn time as your cues and not using ems. we would like, however, for you to bias the ems. set in a plus 118.8 at - and it will go to normal at t. minus 30 seconds zg and we'd just be interested in what the ems does under, a very small g field like this."
"16, houston. since we're going into ptc pretty quick, there are about four things we need to get done."
"okay. s-ivb tank pressure's about 32, coming down, on the oxidizer; and about 28, coming down, on the fuel."

go.
"well, i guess - i guess the - the thing foremost in my mind during those 3 days was how i was going to keep up with the time line and the flight plan, and how i was going to keep track of all the ex- periments we had going and where they were, and - and whether they were operating or not. and i guess that was a very, very fast 3 days for me. when i wasn't looking at the sim bay experiments, i was looking out a window and taking pictures, and it was a pretty crammed b days. as a matter of fact, i - i guess i didn't really have - have much time to give any thoughts to being alone out there."
"oh, 0.4. l_p-eva yes, that 's the range."

"okay, jim. in order to save on an amp or 2 of power here, we'd like you to go to the down voice backup comm configuration, which is pulling the power amd circuit breaker and going to down voice backup. if we get into a comm problem, all you have to do is reverse that configuration, and it should be good again. over."
let me cheek that.
and we're right on the time line.

you're going to get up tlm - -
"okay. and i just heard the word that, if you really need it, go ahead and use it, but if don't have a strong reason for moving it, leave it as it is. and on - we - we're observing the radiator temperature - occasionally cycling above 80 degrees. this is out of limits, and we don't really have a good solution for this at the present time. we could think about turning on the evaporator, but that would foul up the mass spectrometer, and we'd rather not do that. the only things that it's - that the high temperature would be bothering are the imu pipas, and we have - we - since the temperature is cycling up and down, cools off on the back side of the moon, we - on the dark side of the moon, we - we think there's no - no imminent danger to that system. so, our feeling on that is to leave the system as it is."
okay. now what you got hung up on last time over there was that pan camera - -
currently going over maskelyne mas -
"okay, hank; go ahead."
okay; strapped in.
"yes, but you're going to be looking at the nadir, arentt you?"
okay. we're starting.
"hey, that's real good, ken."
okay. i think we've got the picture.
okay. that only occurs when you're zeroing?
"yes, jim. if you could with the tongs, we'd like it back."
there we go.
"15, this is houston. all systems are looking good t down here, and until we tell you otherwise, all the aoss are as in your flight plan."
okay.

"okay. ,onfidentia"
"we're not there yet. long ways to go yet. it's on the other side of the earth, if the simulator's any good."

"well, the umbilical drops out; and, when the umbilical drops out, it - it - it - it just goes dead on power until we get in."

w'egot plenty o;_radar. me're going to do it.
"okay, jack. copy."
there it is. okay. i'll do a star check.
"no, sir, just getting ready to start. and, pleased to have a chance to talk to you."
when is the press conference?
okay.
"how's it going? 05 23 oh 09 cdr hello, dick. how do you read? over."
"roger, 11. we'd like to perform a waste-water dump at your convenience some time in the near future here. no particular time scheduled. down air at the time for midcourse correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting midcourse correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. for your information, the calculated value of the burn for midcourse number 3 was eight-tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. canceling this, if we decide to burn midcourse correction 4, this would then give you a burn for midcourse cor- rection 4 of 2.0 feet per second. at 53 hours we have an imu realign p52. we're requesting that you do this while in ptc, and we plan to continue ptc throughout the day. over."
okay.
roger.
okay_ we're counting.
"there's a big white clast. there's one on top about a foot and a half across, and here's one - must be 2 feet across - 3 feet. *** in the blue-gray. feel like a kid playing in a sandbox. i2_-eva well, bob, i think i've done the best z can. i would - i'd say that they're pretty clearly inclu- sions of blue-gray in the anorthositic gabbro here near the contact."
"roger. okay, and the - on the eva-3 post card prep for equipment jett 1, change ""31 percent"" to ""22 percent."""
"apollo 15, houston. standing by."
"okay, jack. john covington advises that the sight gage is not a certain indicator that you're filled, and so we're just going to go by time to be sure, and try to disregard the sight gage readings as a positive indication anyway. _p-lm okay, understand that from the past, and we went exactly by time before. we'll try it again here."
...
"i didn't know we were going to do both of these things. i thought we were going to do one or the other. but - if we're going to do it, we might as well do it right. 06 21 4_ 56 cdr-eva mark it. it's flashing."
"gordo, one question. how does the spacecraft look to you? i didn't hear anything all night long as far as any master alarms or anything."
"okay, hit,pemk, nounal. 0_ 22 05 40 lmp roger. 0_ 22 0_ 47 cc re_[er, ani we mighz as well go to 25 on the zoom, al. oh 22 05 53 cdr i jus_ zoomed by you. verify h4 - -"
yes. we'll get there.
verify cuff gage does not drop below 4.8.

"hey, babe, you doing - how you doing? nice to talk to you."
okay.
"11, houston. we had a - -"
"well, i'm not there yet, charlie. 07 09 21 14 imp okay."
got your eyeball in that telescope?
okay. why don't you start to the sep site - -
"hello, houston; clipper."
"okay, joe, our - our sum total at station 2 was two chips off the large rock, soil from the fillet, soil adjacent about a couple of feet away from the rock, soil from beneath the rock, and the double core, and the comprehensive."
uh-oh.
okay. 06 i1 28 15 cc ail righty. 06 11 28 16 _p i can still have good navigation through the cmc.
roger.
no way.
"yes, they can. they get in that automatic disconnect - -"
"okay, and i'm going to hold my hand here. okay; now the next thing is that i want to do this maneuver - is within 30 - at - any time after 30 seconds, i can start my maneuver."
"(laughter). yeah. that's a good way to start. don starts off with a nice little innocuous remark like we have some flight plan changes for you. by the way, they start in 2 minutes (laughter)."
"okay. i think i know the area you mean, and i'll check it out again when it comes by."
everything looks good to me.
rl_rk.
"roger, jack. you've been sounding good."
roger.
"okay, because as we come across the ..., we might see something. yeah. o0 o0 47 06 cml° okay, and that thing just gets stowed out here. here, i - i put up my little - -"
ail right.
"okay, bob. that white-colored inclusion we sampled looks like a strange -"
"hey, i'll tell you what we're parked next to."
"okay, fine. when you took the double core, did you notice any soil falling out of the core tubes while you put the caps on?"
"okay, dave. go ahead, and we're watching the drivers at the same time."
okay. you ready to -
415 plus 10 000. enter. 80 - -
"oh, yes."
"and, 15. time to start the terminator now."

"okay, verify the trim."
okay. (tranq)
okay. reach up here and give me the ... panel i.!
roger. we know exactly which one you're talking about.
the fires. out the right side. looka there' they were right. they were really right.
reacs - they're good.
"okay, the legs are in the surfa;_e approxima_e!y 1 inch, i would say. appear to be fairly equal all the way around - perhaps the leg to the left is in an inch and a half."
"okay, ron, the direct ascent, get lift-off: 188:01:35.93; get tpi: 188:55:57.00. over."
"roger. roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the flight plan, 1t. roll is now 198.6, pitch is 1307. over."
"©kay. 02 20 10 47 _,_p gom it?"
"okay, ed. if you would, we'd like a few words from you on the subject of the ags. we've lost the ags downlink telemetry and sort of at a loss as to what its current status is. could you spare a little time for that? 05 23 40 08 l_c° roger. it performed beautifully up until the time you asked me to check circuit breakers. i looked, and the circuit breakers are okay. i started to look at it for a backup braking gate about that time, and found i could not access it. further- more, the ball, the ags ball, is_still at 150 de- grees pitch, zero yaw, zero roll and has been for some time. and i have no warnings, all the circuit breakers are in, but i cannot access it to get a self test."
"probably can ... that out. 02 high flow, jack, that's a master alarm ... there it is. yes ..."
"roger, lmp. you're coming through a little bit scratchy but sounds - we can read you. you're sounding good. how me on vhf?"
"we went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees."
"oh, it's got to go about 3 degrees."
okay. i guess we're ready to head on out. do you agree?
what looked like fragments is just big spalls - spalls of where the zap pits have cleaned off the rock.
"yes. you've got me all discobooberated, perspective-wise, now that we're in orbit. you feel the same way?"
right. the spacecraft's really working nicely. okay. we're picking up panel 2 now. still a little bit of the checklist.
"okay. i dropped - i dropped it onto the strut; part of it fe - broke off. i'm sorry. okay, tidy mesa blankets; i've done that. big rocks, i've done. i'm ready to clean emus and stow antennas."
"propellant quantity monitor, off."
"hey, how do we set up this sleep period? are we on omnis or what?"
huh?
"_q_.._y._, ,_,_,_"
"yes, that's right. option 3."
okay. that's about exactly where i was. another 45 seconds to go.
okay. let me get behind the door.
things pretty miserable up there?
roger. go.
"challenger, houston. you have a go for undocking and sep."
"okay, jim. i guess the significant point there is that you didn't notice the vibration before you saw the engine light."
... - -
"apollo 13, houston. over."
i look good at 30.
"this is fan - you know, i just can't believe how much a thrill this is."
"well, they're putting - -"
yawing out.
"okay. we're reading you, houston."
"aca/4 jet, two, enable."
"white dots out plus eva decals. 05 22 07 06 lmp-i_m okay, mine are configured."
yes. i guess you guys were pretty tired last night after that busy day.
"- - lspe, and i'll - -"
"you don't need your ... depress but you don't need it. iimi-°i_m oh, yes."
"(laughter) it's a good deal. you hop off and work like mad for l0 minutes and hop back down - hop on, sit down, and take a break."
"oh, we'll get that. okay, you lock that side. i'll pull these pins. okay, this one's not locked out, either. okay, now it is. this hinge pin is in."
"aquarius, houston."
"okay. on - these are just cleanup items, jack. on page 2-3, it lists now you separate, from the cm/sm sep and all that, so, obviously, if we're on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted. and that gets deleted all the way over onto page 2-4, up to the line where it says ""15 min- utes.'' and at that point, we pick back up and everything. from 15 minutes down is valid."
"and, before you - you test that particular circuit breaker, just make sure that the group 5 circuit breakers are open, and we won't be risking anything by testing it. now finally, after this note, we've got several deletions, and i'll continue on here. delete ""ullage and thrust, on""; delete ""sps thrust light, on""; delete ""delta-v thrust, b""; delete ""ullage and thrust, on""; delete ""monitor thrusting pc 95 to 105, ems counting down."""
"if - i'm not sure right offhand what the angular size of the moon is, jack. if you can get it in the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but you may have to go into the telescope in order to define the center. either one's acceptable. _)9 07 08 04 cmp okay. i1' [ can define the center through thc soxtatlt, do it that way. anti if f can 't, usc thc telescope_."
"kind of a shame to throw it away, isn't it?"
i don't think that will fit.
okay.
say again?
okay. we have the cardboard on it and the metal shade behind that.
"i_sain't locked up, john."
"(laughter) okay. we copy that, jim."
... showing 63 and i ...
"no, i'm at i frame per second."
"okay, this ought to give the folks back home some- thing to look at right here. okay, we're at our first stop. okay. power this beauty down."
"roger, houston."
i can put it over here in a minute.
"apollo 11, houston through aria."
okay.
] wasn't noticing jim too much. i'd say i put in maybe about six or seven inputs. i don't think it ever got off more than a couple of needle widths.
okay.
okay. 04 00 54 43 _ okay. pull the breakers.
"this country is so rolling and lmdulating, fred, with rises and dips everywhere, that you carlbe going by a fairly good-size crater and not even recognize it."
yes.
"roger, 15. you have a go to proceed."
mark cmp.
"oh, come on. (laughter) i'm not sure there's any place to put it on the ground level. l_p-eva no, *** dig a place."
isn't that something?
yes.
"rate scale, 5 degrees a second."
trim.
"no, i didn't copy that you wanted them open. i just got 107. i was abo_t to ask you that."
mark. you have it now.
"okay? and, lets - now i'm going to take a look and see if it looks like a cinder cone. hey! there's maraldi gamma, the mound sticking up there right beside maraldi. hey, you guys are going to have some good hills to run down in there. can you see it all - at all, coming up?"
"no, i didn't, pete. they got the tape on. i'll check it as soon as we get aos."
"okay, cmc auto there, gene, please."
"17, why don't we get that scoop sample as the first sample of jack's radial sample, 177"
"oh, look at that horizonl isn't that pretty? you got one out your side, too, charlie?"
beg your pardon?
okays tony. i'm going to give you a little stereo on this boulder.
okay.
...
"well, i reckon what we ought to do is the burn, and then get suited. burn and then get suited, you know - finish up the burn. you can put on your suit; get it out of the way. go clear out the tunnel."
"aquarius, houston. we got part of your trans- mission. understand the ptc has deteriorated quite a bit and you'd like to know what to do about it. is that affirm? 04 01 21 10 imp negative. how do you read now, vance?"
cabin repress. okay.
"oh, all right."
"houston, endeavour. go ahead."
copy that.
"okay. looks like we'll bracket it, there: f/ll, 1/125, one frame on each filter; and f/ll at 1/250, one frame on each filter; and without a filter, one - f/ll at 1/1000; and polarizing f/ll at 1/500."
wait a minute.
"roger. _d now i have the no pdi plus 12. orion, we've turned the biomed off. 04 06 09 46 lmp-_ okay, go ahead. okay, you got the old biomed off."
"charlie, what else do you want? you don't want any bacon squares, huh, charlie? 07 22 25 15 _ no. just some - just like some juices."
"okay, we copy the gimbal is swinging and we copy you moved the bubble out to the edge of the bubble level and come back into the inner circle."
go ahead. ready to copy. (columbia)
fine. your ...
"and, jim - okay, we got the ascent bats on at 103:42. the ed bats are go at 37 volts."
"that, in itself, is a singular event."
did you disconnect the lm to cm umbilicals? verify.
they're closed.
read you loud and clear.
"okay, tony. at 191, at 3.1, we're coming into some good-sized whitish-looking rocks that are 3 and 4 mesers across. they're fractured. there's probably a per_nent shadowed sample - no, that wouldn't be - -"
please do.
think you can call another one up?
"okay, gordo's off. i'll have to wait a minute here, gene."
"yes. copy that. thank you. dmp-eva in the rim itself though, victory is - is not blocky. there a little - there is an - some increase in fragment size, but that seems to be the result of some craters in the rim that have gotten below the debris that's covering it. i'd say that victory's somewhat like horatio in that it has blocky inner walls but essentially a normal block population on the rim."
have you run a earth set alinement in the simula- tor with a docked configuration?
(_l_ing)
"i'm through, now."
right.
"okay. below ""guidance control, ags,"" the third step should be changed to be mode control, both, to att hold."
okay. going to block.
"very good. go ahead. o1 11 10 50 cml° okay. commander's ops had a source pressure of 5800, 5800, and a regulated pressure of 3.8. and the lmp's source pressure was 5800, and regulator pressure was 3.85."
huh?
"apollo 11, houston. we missed your del_a-tig and also your delta burn time. over."
then let's have them up.

"the purge valve to depress. cb configuration. okay? cb(16) ecs: suit fan 2, close."
okay.
"and, eagle, houston. we'd like you te select aft omni now. it will be good for both los and aos. over."
"john, the truth is the backup crew wrote those questions. and i got your midcourse 7 pad and entry pad."
"roger. 104:30:08. 54; cross range, plus 0003.3; deda 231, plus 56943. oh 08 09 36 lmp roger. okay, your t - your throttle in min? okay. throttle, min."
"ye_, that's all. for now."
okay; go ahead.
"jim, you're 5 by."
"15, this is houston, broadcasting in the blind, with a request that, if possible, we bring back dave's lcg. if it's already stowed in too inaccessible a place in the - in the jettison bag, don't bother. but if you can possibly save it, please bring it back."
"yeah, yours is doing the same."
probably did because it stayed in your scoop so well.
"15, omni bravo, please."
"okay. *** reckoning comes at 4 minutes, jack. *** weight's building up, looking good. attitudes are good."
"the att - it was actually rolling apparently. 03 11 57 04 cml° yes, we're - you know, we're - we were drifting in a 5-degree dead band. it's just that i'm real - see, we just had a firing there. yes, after we sat there and talked about it. it's - it's the pro on that 21101. son of a gun. see, we just wasted some gas. we were talking about it."
i thought you might be able to break it up.
"- - when you're not holding on with two hands, we'd like the frame count from you."
"okay, sounds good. 06 01 39 55 i_mp-eva let's fill up the bag."
"okay, we underst_d it's a completely different situation, charlie."
are we on mike?
"how about the core tubes, do we put all the core tubes in the rock box also? 06 '05 23 06 cc okay. charlie, we can put four core tubes plus csvc in the rock box and then plus what documented samples you can get in there. 06 05 23 16 i2_p-eva four core tube, csvc documented sample, gotcha."
"and keep a positive closing rate. 04 0_ 25 23 cmp okay. it's likely to be expensive, but we'll do that. okay. you're going to have to - your needles are better than mine. why don't you tell me what to do there, john."
yes.
take a look at them.
"hank_ we didn't say anything about this verb 48 at 167:20, but i assume we meant to delete that."

okay.
"roger,"
got pitch zero.
... charlie.
"okay, bus ties, bat b."
- - gravimeter? you've got another big rock over here from the - -
okay.
"okay, i'll buy that. yes."
"okay, jack. that's going to take 120 mnp-hours out of the lm, which is equivalent to 10 hours, which will put us back to 193 hours, and that's plenty."
"okay. houston, i just picked up a grab sample of a breccia. it's very friable. it looks shocked; it has black clasts in it - black clasts a couple of _illimeters across. and the - it's so worn down that you know what it really looks like? it looks like a - if i can use the analogy - i'm not sure what the heck it is. it looks like a - a tuft. it just looks like a rock with a - you see, the clasts are sticking out of it, is what i'm saying. 06 22 53 20 i2_p-eva 0kay, tony. what other pictures you want me to get with the 500? i've done the interior of the crater. you - you say you wanted smoky or stone mountain?"
okay; four items. i'm just marking down four marks here.
"7, cmp 7, lmp 5.5. and we've completed the postsleep checklist. standing by for a consumable update. over."
okay. understand.
"okay, houston, coming up on 6 minutes."
roger. we - we concur down here.
"okay. and, jack; houston. over."
okay. we'll burn pgns on time. and we're just about to attitude.
"... would be sure, if you did it that way. 03 04 36 _8 cdr okay. now they're ... we locked."
i was afraid of that.
"okay. we'll get breakfast cooking here, and give you a call."
"okay, noun 33 is 112:02:51 - 112:02:51.92."
okay.
"houston, 16."
"yes. and again looking at the - looking to the south along that - the edge of the rille that faces to the northwest, i can see several large blocks that have rolled downslope. very large blocks that are about three-quarters of the way down the - slope - into the rille. that's just at the base of st. george."
what's next? 07 00 lb 26 cdr-lm okay; pull the purge valve out. you did it. disconnect ops 02 hose. 07 00 lb b3 lmp-lm in work.
i'd like to know how eeco_i wants to get rid of it. there are a number of different ways and what does he think is the best one?
i trust. 0b 02 58 33 cdr okay.
"orion, houston's go."
...
nice and smooth.
"roger. we're standing by for it, and the angles as published on l/3-3 should be good."
roger.
"5_ree - 3 feet s second, closing."
"okay, jack. can you - can you read the high gain now?"
okay.
it is ever beautiful.
"now, you're good. .confidentrai"
"yes,_i see them now."

"okay. pin 2 is pulled. still safe. pin 3 is pulled, and it's still safe. don't know what i would do if it wasn't."
"okay, we're still headed northwest, bob."
prim 1.
"okay, houston. go ahead with your pad."
yes. okay; i'm going to go over and configure for it.
"okay. the volts, joe, are 38.9 and the amps are 1.9."
"what did you do with my extension handle? oh, it's -"
"no, it's coming up 7."
yeah.
"uh-oh; all of the contingency -the disposal con- tainers just fell out on the floor. just a minute. get the camera. ob 18 32 32 cdr okay, houston. with respect to _he erosion pattern, directly under the engine bell, there is *** 3 feet to the southeast of the ....location of the bell. that's probably where the thrust was when the engine was cut off. and the i_lslowly drifted to the northwest from there."
it is.
roger. and we're showing 2 plus 30 left in the eva.
"okay. our checklist has ""all jets"" scratched out, and it says ""enable couples on all axes."" so what we'll do is - we'll reestablish this thing and come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all jets. that means enable quads a and b. is that right ?"
i've got to - i've got to trip that latch with - with tongs or something to lock it.
"ed, this is houston. we'd like you to - on panel panel 16, cycle the asa and ae circuit breaker - aea circuit breaker, if you would, please."
"and, fred, we're doing a little better on our water than we had anticipated. our numbers were designed for 3.5 pounds per houri we're using about 3.0, and expect to go a little bit less."
"thank you! okay, i'm starting for 4 - -"

"okay. i got it out, without doing anything."
...
yes.
"... ph, 39; so it's 14 minutes. fourteen minutes - here's 20; we're right around in here. now - we're looking backwards. we ought to turn this map around the way we're going, see."
okay.
"thirty seconds to go, bob."
"i'm right over here, babe."
"and would you believe, i've found a use for the big scoop. 04 22 36 21 _ okay, here comes the core tube."
"okay. will try foxtrot - franny. don't forget to get that boulder track. that's a good one. l_,5_-ftia, i'm going to have to lean against the rover to - - l 5-75"
"if you wouldn't complain so much, we wouldn't leave you so much."
(laughter)
"next page, 286:25, ""ir cover, open,"" delete thaz. and on the next page, 287:13, ""ir cover, closed"" and ""ir, off,"" delete both of those. and a little further down the page it says ""lmp doff biomed harness."" change that to ""cdr doff biomed harness."""
"coming up at picard now. looking at it - a little bit from a distance, there's a darker albedo that goes about a half a crater in diam- eter from it. and then, on top of that darker albedo - it only goes out maybe a fourth of a crater diameter - there's a lighter type material - that seems to be covering it up. the lighter type material though only goes in a generally westerly - well, from the south around to the west side and then kind of from the northeast around to the northwest side, and it leaves the dark material draping down in the side of picard on the east side of picard."
"okay, charlie."
"okay. will do. i'll take them again. i'm going to take a few pan's first, houston, if that's okay. it'll take about an additional 3 minutes."
"okay, jim, we just took a look at your angles, and you're looking good here. your pgns is looking good. we can't yet explain the attitude error needle thing, but i suggest you continue on in your maneuver."

"okay. that's good. let me - let me wait until they get up, or at least jack gets up. he should be getting up before fred. and we'll try to get back on the schedule. i hate to wa_e everybody up right now though, if they're sleeping."
okay; 11 minutes.
yes - it would be - down - -
"and, before you get on, remember to close the battery covers if they -"
"we can get several examples. we ought to sample across that layering, actually - that foliation."
... big thing. this is easy.
"okay, houston; aquarius. i'm flying it back over towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch of 257. i'll get near the bellyband in roll and yaw; then i'll go to pgns att hold."
okay. everything's nice and straight in here. (tranq ) *** three asterisks denote clipping of word and phrases. (goss net 1) tape 70/23
"there. oooh, me! they're open. how you doing, jim?"
okay.
"yes, sir. yes, sir."
"i know you're not going to be happy with this, but we got to bring back the uneaten food. and there's one clean towel."
go ahead.
(laughter )
they didn't fill them.
roger. in work.
no. we got plenty.
roger; we'll open the crossfeeds and close main sov a. we're configured.
"thank you, dave. we copy all that."
"ll, houston. we copy. !i"
"you're not trying to run the charts too, are you?"
*** receiver? stand by. let me finish with scb-7 here. t
"roger. for the padded bags, we would wanted lying- on - the - surface stuff."
"i'm going to, i'm looking for a place. away from craters and rocks."
go straight down from where you are.
okay.
"okay. houston, he had full volume up and is not receiving you."
"orion, bring battery 3 on at - at minus 5."
"it's already there. 03 23 50 07 iimp okay, noun 15 enter."
"2, 1 -"
mm-ham. just what i'd always eat when i was starv- ing down south. 09 20 37 56 _ kept people alive.
"okay, john. the configuration for - - 07 05 30 08 cd_-izm - - g_%vscopy those angles?"
"put the thumb on one side, and i'll - -"
"if you're wondering how many pictures we took, at last count night before last, it was something like 1840 some."
too ... of the ...
"right, it sure looks it, but i can see you're getting it down. 06 02 52 50 i/_p-eva - - ... it's in."
roger.
"i suspect you've got to be in g&n or cmc control, haven't you?"
- - too many rocks there.
you can see where we've been pounding on this rock. we didn't succeed in getting samples everywhere. and i'm giving you a 90-degree corner.
roger. any special places this stuff seems to collect that you can tell?
okay.
"okay, we_il hold thav for a minute_ ?he verhi_ra%cr is coming across_ of course, at the os-0oslce slae of the moon from the big basin you're ioo__in_xay."
"that's a good readback, jack. i've got a ia{dap read-up here for you. they recommend this be copied on page i of the lm data card book, jack."
"roger, pete. well done."
"understand, bob. understand."
roger. you've got it.
"al, we'd be pleased to have any general comments you had about the sim bay experiments, otherwise than what we 'ye specifically asked you. did every- thing look in order?"
yes.
"that may very well go - this is very easily steno right over here. let's - let's see, we're between the two big ones - that wouldbe - -"
"i've got to turn my oxygen on a second, jack. lmp-i_'_ yes, so do i."
okay.
i'm driving out of here - -
leave it under the - throw it away; it's empty. pull it straight up; there you go. that cr_y thing. yeah. that's okay.
"question number 9 for dave scott. in view of your comment to geologist leon silver about the need for trained scientists on the moon, do you think that scientist-astronaut jack schmitt should be included in the crew of apollo 17, the last of the apollos ?"
"yes, there's ... zero phase. yes, i can see aristarchus. i think that must be aristarchus. way back over to the north."
"roger, ed."
okay. i guess you'll want to go back the way you came and go back to that attitude where you had good sunlight on it.
"okay, bag 27-nancy. and another documented sample - -"
oksy. this nice big depression over here.
"4g's, you're right on."
"okay. you'll start the tape recorder, is that affirmative ?"
- -tei pad to rev 43 .... - -
"okay, we're back in auto. cuff gage readin_ l.9. onftden["
"***, 17. you're go for midcourse 2."
how's it doing?
roger. like to remind you to configure the dse as per the flight plan.
very strange.
we'll fill it. just a minute.
"go ahead, houston."
here you go.
"yes, make sure - m_ke sure i get them all in _-_ though, so we don't have any hanging up in the cabin ..."
roger. we're not going there yet. i'll tell you when.
roger.
"hello, endeavour - houston, this is endeavour, loud and clear. onfi -dl ijliim day5"
"15, houston."
"say again the reading on the velocity, john."
yes.
i'll grab this one right here.
"okay. that's correct, jack. and now we'll go into the main bus powerup procedure. and the first step there, is on panel 5- we want the bat charger bat a charge circuit breaker closed, and the bat charger bat b charge circuit breaker closed. over."
"okay. we need to get a - put one of those dikes in another bag. bob, it looks like some fraction of the blue-gray material has obviously - -"
that's the one we were talking about. earlier.
...
ail right.
"i understand that one of your reasons for a suited entry is the fact that the command module hatch ... hasn't been good. it doesn't seem to be any different, but in the other ... our hatch is no better than other spacecraft."
doesn't seem possible they could go that fast.
"okay, ... - -"
"ha! i'm sure not, joe. not really - - 04 23 51 08 lmp-i_ look, let's check it out when we get out, joe."
"okay, bob. we're pretty close now to - no, really not. we're still about 100 meters, i think, from where the break in slope is - with the plane. and - but we're away from the block population except for scattered - two great big blocks out ahead of us, this side of the swp crater. and - but the average population is down to the 1 percent or less, again. that average population really never changed up in here. just the big blocks were around. i saw some little half-meter to one-third-meter, glass-lined, pit-bottom craters."
roger. minus .1.
"okay, and i'll put it on you here, babe."
"okay, houston. charlie's prd is 21118."
okay.
okay. just reminded we owe somebody a bat b voltage.
okay. that sounds like a good guess.
"that's affirmative. i0 01 10 03 cc ken, you want to keep an eye on your roll?"
"okay, bob. i'm back up now and i'll stay with you."
"roger. at 273:01, we cancel the burn status re- port and we add: ""x-ray experiment on. alpha x- ray covers, open, and record the get."""
"tony - tony, the problem looks like finding a flat spot to deploy the alsep. it's just hummocky, rolling terrain with 4- or 5-meter ridges."
you cut out on the telmu. who is it?
"hold that for a minute - it was a pitching deck. okay: that is in. boy, its in. locked - took a lot to ""in"" ih."
okay. here they come. echo: 113:02:00 - -
"okay, copy that. farewell, aquarius, and we thank you."
"okay, houston. how do you read the challenger? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. over."
okay; stand by.
"okay, just a second, gene, let me look at it. see resolve - power is off. do the old optics? yes. i think - (laughter) outstanding idea - having a great drink. (laughter) okay, 24. done that. doesn't matter. okay."
"okay, we'll try to put it in the center of the three craters to get all three - well, to get whatever stratigraphy we have here. and the last fillets - picture, shadow 9 o'clock - was 18."
that doesn't do it very much. got to be very
"america, houston. g&c, with his years of expe- rience, thinks that this ptc is going to hold. it's looking good so far, and so i think it's safe to go ahead and configure to go to sleep there, if you wish."
"okay. ems delta-v test, set delta-v, direct ullage, two, close- -"
"i guess that's better than no shampoo. 04 06 48 15 hmp-lm yeah, i think you're right. jim, we were really impressed with that landing site from 10 miles, anyway, it sure looks exactly like the i2_a."
"and when you get there, you'll read 3.0 and l0 degrees."
it's locked.
"okay, ken. how much to undocking? qill/i// 2°8"
"on the mass spec, it was on the mass spec, it was 02:33. on gamma ray, 03:09."
"roger. and about 100:43, ""terminate emi° 509, after p24 complete."""
- - switch to secondary - -
...
"16, could you give us a reading on lm/cm delta-p?"
okay.
"very good. very good. onfidenti,abt"
"we're not getting high bit rate data yet. 01 02 37 10 cml° okay; we'll stand by for your cue then, joe."
stand by and ... come on.... logic ...
"hmm. well, that's what the ags says, but that ain't right. 0b 03 48 20 cdr well, it must have been - you know - - 04 03 48 21 _ ye_ yeah. 04 03 48 22 .ar - - you can't - ._n_hing less than a _le, these things ain't no good. because - well, ags is okay. but this thing here measures from the center of the moon. i don't have the foggiest notion where our boy is."
"oh, yes. oh, yes - -"
"okay, you're fixing it."
"apollo 11, this is houston. over. 03 04 41 b5 cdr go ahead. 03 04 41 b7 cc ll, houston. during your sps burn as played back on tape down here, we've observed the nitrogen tank bravo pressure in the sps system dropping a little bit more than we anticipated. it's holding steady right now. we'll continue to watch it and keep you posted if anything comes up. over."
about 2 or 3 feet is all.
"okay, john, i didn't catch that. do you want these times for page 5-5?"
okay.
roger. looks good.
"heys,tony, are you folks ready for us to press on with a little film cycle?"
"you don't see one of those white gloves down there anywhere, do you?"
"okay. i had a tone, too. i still got a pressure and a vent flag. izmp and, houston, how do you read the lmp?"
roger. understand. cml° i'll take two pictures about a minute apart if i can. and it'll be frame 70.
... first?
"we sus - we suspect that there was some problem about the new attitude, and we were getting same sort of reflection off your skin up there."
okay; good. sounds like the old hansel and gretel trick will work.
"okay, i'm going to put in a foot plus-x. okay? as long as we are using brute force, we might as well."
there' s more badges (laughter).
"hey, we're way high, john; we got to get down. way high on the h-dot."

"yes, it hung down."
"okay, fred. we're receiving your med data; it was a little slow in coming in. r_= 474 04 01 43 09 imp okay."
"dog 4. okay, they're disabled."
okay. we copy that.
"are you 5.1, also? 05 22 16 34 lmp-/2/ coming down about 5."
"okay. bag 476 is the rock sample with a little bit of the soil near it - with a chip - chip off the rock, and it's the - watch it, gene. cdr-ev.a here's your other chip. if i go down there, that thing is about 15 feet deep."
- - right where we are on the scroll.
"yeah, 36."
go ahead.
huh?
that goes in the pga bag.
"yes, that's verified. i did not touch anything."
"okay, copy those."
"roger, guys. when you are comfortably through with the procedure here, we'd like for you to turn the thrust light out for us, please, by pulling the ems main a and b circuit breakers, two of them, on panel 8."
"yes, i see those."
"okay, ed. that's in work now."
"roger. 0.98, and what have you been r_sding for 02 flow on your onboard gage? over."
"okay. and, as of right now, we have a 30-minute extension."
that - that shade; then you can check it.

where's my ...?
"okay. ppk, two, and flag kit, one, is all that is"
"roger. lev's go to 50. 04 19 2h 03 cdr okay, 50."
okay.
bruce. is any appreciable dust flying off of these boots? i'd like not to take all that dirt in there.
high gain to auto.
"yes, jack. z was just about ready to call you. underneath quad 4, i noticed a lot of sparklies going out."
"roger, ron. how does color of picard - the r_m deposits on picard compare to the surrounding mare material there?"
"okay, let's see. confirm normal, we've done that. we've stowed the water wings. now it's the tsb is the only item left outstanding there."

"no, i don't mean that. i mean let's bring the rover back up here."
"okay, ed. john's coming out of his suit now."
"hello, houston. this is america. we're showing ... 1.8 short."
"come on, you guys, ..."
"one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. this is a test of the recorder - recording capability. one, 2, 3, 4, 5- over. 07 03 01 39 cmp# three, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. this is a test of the recorder - recording capability."
"oh - oh, okay. waste water - -"
"what's your best guess for p21, say, ken?"
go ahead.
"dave, i'm going to stand up on the rover. get the bslss bag locked."
"roger. does it look like that one we saw on the track the other day? i_4p yes, very much like that one that you almost caught. look at that. there's a tongue depress - several of them - grabens in here. we must be out on the edge of serenitatis now, right?"
"you did, and i put it in."
okay. why don't you tell him you've got him standing by when he's ready?
"ail right, get the cap."
"yes; we're on, gordo. go ahead."
okay; we'll take gary's little formula here. see if we can't get a picture of that contact. nice close picture for him.
"hey, hank. did you want all of them or just mine?"
affirm.
"that already ...? shit, you guys could be doing that while i'm tracking."
"you know, this thing's ... about 30 degrees ..."
a y-foot cross-sun to the south.
"you know really, we had very few problems. it seemed like a very tame simulation, as far as i was concerned. certainly, there were - there were - there were irritating things that happened like some circuit breakers in the spacecraft here that gave us some trouble, and some lights that aren't working exactly right. but certainly none of the important aspects of the flight or - or none of the essential pieces of equipment have malfunc- tioned, and i think it's been just great."
r and r-dot in 10 minutes - -
"you know, the rocks that we were picking up at 5 and 6, that was a long time before station ll and - and i - -"
yes.... 06 23 52 bo cdr-eva brush you off.
your ags on?
roger. go ahead.
"hey, jim, you're in the way of the camera, old buddy."
"okay, i think we could keep track of it other- wise; but that's fine."
"yes. i know it shows it on the map there, and i haven't really got a good - a good clear picture of a ray, yet."
okay.
we're thinking. stand by.
"yes, we're okay. think of something here. 05 21 46 16 lmp-_m dropped the tape. _-_"

"oh no, it's all right. you're probably about to. you're all right."
"roger. how do you read houston? over. 06 01 43 43 cdr-ii_ joe, we're reading you loud and clear. we're - the left-hand col_n and we're both going plss mode to 0 and we'll be off the air for a skosh."
roger _ ron.
"don't know what, charlie? 0_ 04 28 25 cmp range rate?"
"it hasn't happened yet, john. it's about another - 9 minutes or so."
"between gator and palmetto - we almost hit a great big rock, but old percy, here, avoided it. look at that. 194, john, takes us right out our tracks. between gator and palmetto, tony, there's a swale - a depression that runs east-west that is apparently more cratered and a lot fresher craters there than what we've been driving on between palmetto and north ray."
i'm really just eating.
yes. that did it.
"tranquility, houston. we have you pitched up about 4-1/2 degrees. over."
$taad by. we're thinking about it.
"yes. i agree, charlie. that sounds right."
okay. will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? that's okay. i'll align the ags with the pgns. you can tell me a little later if you need some help.
i've got the decided feeling i'm going to sleep tonight.
"ken, the surgeon says he can't tell which - which one of the sensors is dead, so before we take off here and do them all, why don't you try pressing down on them and let him - let him watch his data - maybe we can find out which one is the dead one. press them one at a time."
okay.
okay.
i got it.
*** residuals. what were they?
"apollo 11, this is houston. 03 07 05 44 cm_ houston, you want us back on downvoice backup? over."
"okay, the master alarm has been reset, houston."
"suit fan 2, closed."
"roger, al. sounds like you're seeing a marvelous amount of detail up there."
"casper, this is houston. hold up on that rcs maneuver. 04 04'22 37 cmp okay. i've put in 3 feet pe_ second."
okay.
"well, it's hard."
take number 5.
"save the tv tapes for us, will you please."
that's what i keep thinking. i wonder how come?
"15, go ahead."
"okay. and which ses - which scb is that going in, jack?"
... check - check this. it's going to a higher freq.
wish i had a tissue.
okay.
"roser. ¥o_'re e_i_g in very loud and very clelr, here. out. 00 02 26 38 cc ap$11o 1i, thia is houston. you are go for tli. over."
"isn't that neat, the way stuff just floats around?"
okay. i was just going to read them to you. we got them.
can't you do that for me?
okay.
how would you like a quick look at sports here and then into the news summary while you're having your breakfast?
go.
"yes, you're doing fine, now. o_ 19 48 49 lmp say, houston. this looks like brown talcum powder; it's so fine in most places. 0_ 19 49 01 cdr i think the sun angle is increasing now."
"i - i didn't notice. oh, yes. must be - what number was that, you remember? 06 02 36 01 i24p-eva no, i don't."
"okay, that's - that's fine. we're not concerned about being late with it."
we - we'd like to have auto and narrow.
"in work. 05 22 03 55 cdr-i_4 yes. 05 22 03 58 ijwp-lm push them just as far back as you possibly can, dave."
"that's correct, jim. and if you'll turn.the page now, i want you to delete two lines, one at 218 plus 35 and that is, ""map camera image motion - increase, talkbaek barber pole, on."" delete that, and delete the line at 218 plus 55, which read§, ""map camera image motion - increase, talkback barber pole plus four steps"" et cetera. and, in- stead, put in the instructions: at t-start- it should be barber pole plus four. at 218 plus 39 plus 00, barber pole plus three; and at 218:49 plus 00;barber pole plus four. read back, please. _-_ 09 00 54 4g _ okay, the instructions are that at t-start, it should be barber pole plus 4; at 218 plus 39 plus 00, barber pole plus three; at 218 plus 49 plus 00, barber pole plus four."

"- - sculptured hills, though, is evident as soon as you come out of the - out of wessex cleft."

roger. copy. thank you.
"okay, it's locked."
"endeavour, houston. how do you read?"
"okay, endeavour, how do you reaa the falcon?"
"yes. i'm going to put it in a seat pan now. _md then i - then, why don't you put your bag in here. _ here, let me have - let me have it. i'm going to put your bag in there. your carrier is awful loose, and i don't want to lose that bag. put this on a handtool carrier. 06 02 l0 31 l_p-eva what's in there? rock?"
oki.
and if we hit bottom - -
understand.
"yes, we're happy with that ..."
"houston, apollo 15."
"let me just read it straight off here. there is some words to that effect, but it doesn't sound like 2-1/2 meters. at a large scale - let's see, he's describing a viewgraph here - the surface temperature at the time of this sample was 360 de- grees kelvin. at a depth of about 15 centimeters, it had dropped to 280. at about 65 centimeters, the temperature drops to 254, and that's the lowest temperature we see. below that depth, the temper- ature begins to increase again, and it's 257 at the bottom of the probes. over."
"there's a nice deep one there that's smooth and rounded, about 30 meters across."
"yeah, i know it exactly. i think we'd like for you to try to get the - the steerable up, if you can."
"oh, just cleaning up the back of the rover, here, a little, joe."
okay. you want me to take that one?
it's going right towards the ...
"houston, america. are you all set to copy?"
roger; ignition.
"just a minute, bob. 07 ll 56 06 i24p okay, bob. what changes do you have for us."
you still got a real bad squeal.
yes. 00 02 50 lh cmp it'll be high; it'll come across.
"stand by l, please."
that - that makes it.
"(laughter) i had this bag on the front end, a plastic bag on my rear, and a juice bag in my mouth (laughter). that's the only chance i had all day. with one back-side pass. i used to want to be the first man to mars. this has con- vinced me that, if we got to go on apollo, i ain't interested (laughter). i tell you, it's really surprising how one man in this vehicle, once you get - if you get squared away, there's enough room - and you can do more with one man in here than you can with three, operating all the equip- ment and everything. and i wouldn't have guessed that."
we're about 210.
you get spaghetti again? did i get the wrong food or something?
"uplink squelch, enable."
ok_ty.
"roger, ron. is it continuing to spread out?"
"okay, as far as you can tell, so that we can look at it over night, the rear fender - the part that's remaining - looks in fairly good shape, right?"
"oh, you dummy - you d_,mmy. jack you still with mb."
it's nominal except for that change we read up to you about closing system a main sov before you open the ascent feeds.
"okay. as soon as i get this overhead, you can put your plss fan on. i2_°-_ okay, now, let's watch out for all your parapher- nalia there. can you pull - that - pull that stuff away from there? okay. 06 16 b_ _5 cdr-lm well - ... let me - let me undo this."

"are you dirty yourself, or you - -"
okay.

"oh, boy is right. i had a couple of dadgummits. okay, john. let's go. we got some stuff to do here before undocking. attitude monitor, lmp, to pgns. it is. rendezvous radar mode to slew."
okay?
att i/rate 2.

i want to - going to the right and that thing - i looked up again and it turned around and went back to the left.
okay.
...
"and, ken, have you done the rest of the things there?"
we got to protect our jobs_ jim.
"just for jack's information, you're running in the 80s on your heartbeat. we saw a 91 or 2 there for a few minutes. are you working - still working out?"
"houston, 15."

"how did all our systems look on ..., vance?"
"okay, ed; i have schedar."
"*** here on this side, it looks like the vesicular anorthositie gabbro."
"okay, go ahead. we're listening."

do you want to try the minus 100 part of it? really think it's worth it?
that's what i've got. i'm watching for him to come up on - i mean the horizon. i can see earthrise.
roger. i'll keep you posted on time; press on.
"i don't see any general si - i don't see any general size, gordy. i do have a crater out here that's - maybe a meter in diameter that - fairly fresh, although not bright halo - that has not penetrated to blocky material. and it looks like that the saturation crater size is very small in the area we can see; that is, there don't seem to be any old or very subdued craters - well, let me - let me think about how to put that again. they're - it's obviously saturated with craters a few centi- meters in diameter, but when you get bigger than that, there seems to be more of a - a clear distri- bution rather than a saturation."
is it still sunny and cold back there?
"okay, but we're - we're in auto instead of react [sic]."
there's a big outside.
"america, we're ready now for you to proceed on per flight plan with the verb 49 to the sleep ptc attitude. we have not had a chance to go back over the data, but we'll give you a call as soon as we get a chance to check it. over."
"all i need is your camera, and the etb is going over to the mesa table. and i got a great big rock, a muley."
"okay. but it's a pretty clean cut from the sim bay itself. that's just a piece of that thermal blanket that's sticking around there. man, it's black off this other way! the pan camera lens is all stowed."
i kept - i kept losing him.
"yes, i don't even see the bright spot there anymore. i know - i know where to look for it and i don't even see it."
that's what i mean. if you could clean that off.
"aquarius, houston. request forward omni. how do you read?"
"59, clear, 6 plus 0, 590. hit her."
"but i would guess that south africa is going to have good weather for several more days, at least. and if the pattern is - is apparent in the clouds we see is correct, the last disturbance i mentioned probably is going to pass south of the cape also."
yeah.
"yes, right there. yes. yes, it's coming loose."
are you ready to work?
"apollo 13, houston."
yeah.
"boy, as the sun angle comes up now, the features in the landing area are really fading out."
getting a little uv here.
"jack, we were incorrect on panel 5; that sho_ald have been panel 3. 04 05 22 39 6%4p okay, that's good. i got it."
i'm going to stand here and look around.
"watching your buddies on the screen down here right now, and they've, believe me, they've got more black showing than they do white right now - of those suits. they've really been down among them."
"oh, okay."
"okay, you want - the new bags, they'll be under jack's seat."
"fred, the focus is good enough that we can see the position of your four ball valves at the top of the picture for the big sps engine."
"that's beautiful. okay. your temperatures are down to a hundred - and maybe a sukosh 120 under, so maybe those batteries are cooling off."
copy that.
dropped the brush.
"yeah, recovery is just a different environment. we do have not much of it."
"if she goes into quarantine, it'll be a space first."
yes. and we'll - -
do you have it? and the time was 110:52:00.
okay. match indicated angles - and track mode to slew.
"houston, that's affirmative. alfa and bravo are off. i am reading you. a1 does not seem to be. give him another call. age3-8 onfid"

"roger. going to - _,_hich0mni do you want now, aft?"
okay; got that.
yes. the - i'll be darned.
it's grayer.
roger. it sounds like a good plan and you can use your ttca in min impulse to take care of pitch and roll.
"there's nothing more on that particular page, 77 through 78 hours. 02 19 42 04 cml° okay. maybe i missed something here, but i have - i have not seen us - terminate 509. i'm sure we did somev_here before the loi burn - -"
"yes, i am."
"and, 17, that means stow the high gain after you - after the startup. we'd like to watch the startup itself."

do you want us to terminate the charge when - when i'm reading 39.5?

okay.
"and, gene, just for rough planning purposes, we'll start to figure your sleep period starting around 152:30. and we'll be looking at your getting up around 8 hours from that time."
"charlie, you can leave it just like it is."
"okay. this is the left-hand column and this is - at the bottom, and we'll add the same line there, ""squelch vhf b (lmp) - full decrease."""
"thirty-nine and it's now 53 - at 14 minutes, should be five-sixths."
"or go to cmc, auto."
"okay. we've got it - several comments for you, joe. let us un - uncouple here, and we'll talk to you for a while about this."
that's plenty good enough.
"the neutron probe was exposed to the surface for 49 hours. pi estimates that the distance from the rtg to the probe is 40 meters, which will mean that the background count will be iow, and he thanks you kindly for those few extra steps. and the last one was - to be summarized - was the field geology and they asked for a very short s_]mmary, so walt berger came through with three typewritten pages. so, we're just ,going to skip the whole thing, except the last li:ae,which was to say that you guys did an outstanding job. over. _p _hank_ you gordy. we're just pleased z_av' so mar_y things are working well, and happy ;hav zhe ?zs are satisfied. that was our objeczive, and je came up here to meet it - and those rhinos zhav are done, i hope we met it, well - and we've gel a few more things to do yet."
"okay, bob. just wanted to know how the initial rates of ftc looked?"
"okay; rover's stopped. 06 01 01 13 i_-eva okay; it looks like - from this position - i'd say that's probably spur down there, the large one, dave."
"well, that certainly sounds very good, karl."
and suit circuit relief - auto.
"let me get my umbilical down here. yes, sir. okay, houston, we're maneuvering to the meed attitude,"
"we're satisfied with the tv, gene. we're ready for you to take the ep number 3."
"i've looked at alphonsus on quite a few of our revs; and, at the lower suns, there was absolutely no - nothing i could say about dark halos around those little craters. now, this time, i look at them, a_ldthere's a very obvious dark halo. it looks exactly like the dark halos you see around the two craters to the south of theophilus. i've looked for some topographic or - or surface fea- ture that might he different between the northern and southern halves of alphonsus, and i've had absolutely no luck at all with that. i see now one, two, three distinct, dark halo areas and probably a fourth one. the rim of alphonsus and the rim of ptolemaeus are inseparable - where i am right now. i haven't quite gotten to it yet. the long, north-south trending lineament that runs through alphonsus looks just like the photographs. it does indeed run up there, and it runs through the wall, and looks like it's an extension of the little crater chain that runs through ptolemaeus. halley fill in the floor of ptolemaeus looks just like it does in alphonsus. i don't see any - any really significant difference. the only thing i can say about the dark halo areas in alphonsus - is that - well, i can't get the binoculars on them because i can't get close enough to the window."
"roger. 01 06 32 i',6 cc 11, this is houston. goldstone m&0 re_orts that they can read the nu_m-oerson the dsky. they can also read verb, noun, program, and see the co_p activity light flashi;,_g. 0vet. gl 06 32 _9 cdr v_ry good. thank you_ 01 06 32 '1 cc and they also report you appear to have panned the camera over to another location now."
"okay, let's press on with your suits."
i'm reading you 5 by.
0keydoke.
okay. i've removed the umbilicals - the csm/lm umbilicals. guess i need to install the probe and the drogue. i'll get those things done right now.
"delete tv, on. and anywhere else in there you run across that tv, just delete it."
"okay, first is a reminder that we're counting on using the 0ps to pump up the cabin for sleep tonight - another way of bleeding off the 0ps. guess we'll remind you now so you don't stow it away down underneath something where it's incon- venient. and we'd like a read-out on the ops after you finish pumping up the cabin tonight. second comment is a reminder that we'd like a cue on the vacuum cleaner, if you intend to use it for this contamination control period coming up in a half hour or so. and third one is that as far as the medics are concerned, it's dealer's choice on who wears the biomed tonight. over."
"i still got a water flag. not hot. stand by. okay. well. 04 18 26 b9 lmp-lm how does the water pressures look, houston?"
okay.
very good.
"okay. we wallt you to _ent - tunnel vent unt_], and add the following, ""until i,m/cm delta-p _s equal to 3.0 psid."""
i want that sign.
(laughter) okay. sorry about that.
"yes. i think this is a big frag here, but, it broke - - 06 01 40 34 i_p-eva yes."
"hey, beautiful. 04 17 10 06 _ i think we got our problem solved."
"roger. we need to tweak up your pipas a little biv more, dave, before tp_v."
... okay. where's the bracket?
i'm sure this book's from somewhere - probably up there.
"okay, you're pretty weak there for a second charlie. try it again."
"take a pan, yes. good idea."
"the answer to that is yes, bob. i think it's partly - partly faa, but it's also the fact that we did a lot of circling. we didn't drive in many straight lines. trying to find, for the most part, our bearings, amd tried to pick some high spots so we could look around. so i think straight-line navigation out in the area we're going is going to be easily 8 kilometers."
i don't think you're closing.
okay.
"john, the actual pressures on both meters - the actual pressures are the same, although the meters are reading differently."
"man, i just barely passed."
"and if you've got your seratchpad handy, i've got a couple of comments i'd like to - questions i'd like to get up on guyot, you mentioned a while ago."
"roger, apollo 17. if you're ready for the questioning, i'll begin."
"(laughter) that's really tweaking it up. 283, 063, and 328."
what?
*** your flaps? hold your head down.
the emergency cabin regulator check book.
"well, so does that big one - -"
okay.
"go ahead, bob."
"it's a nice little crater, isn't it?"
"jim, that's beautiful. the squeal's gone and you're 5 by. and we're ready to go to the next step."
and we're glad of it.
let me pull it off for you ....
comm carrier.
yes.
what's that?
heed a little more cord there.
no.
removed.
"and, in thinking back about what my intentions were, that looks like probably a very reasonable - reasonable suggestion. and the first thought i had about being close to trident, i didn't think i was anywhere near that close. and, of course, when you look out there and see a big hole, you don't know how big is big when you're down there. that big hole out there might veer easily could have been poppy out at 9 o'clock."
(laughter) looks pretty low.
stand by.
"there it is. t-horizon will be good. yes. okay, i've got the edge of crisium now.... getting hills on the side of crisium, there. sure a lot smoother-looking material than i thought it would be."
"plus 0.2, minus 1 -minus o, minus 1. we got to look at 1620, right?"
"jim, this is bob; go ahead."
...
minus 50; minus 48; minus 48.
"well, if we can't find that other mag, al, we might have to use this one. got the one mag here of black and white from the lm. it has got to be - -"
not too bad for a dope.
... the burn.
roger.
"go ahead, al."
hot damn_ right on the money_
043o3.
okay.
"okay, 13. you are go for pyro arm. canary (rev 2)"
"yes, it fits fine. okay. i'm in."
"all right, you guys can do that."
"okay. your plss is - looks like it is clearing okay. your toes are about to come ov_,rthe sill. okay. now drop your plss down. there you go; you're clear. and laterally you're good. you've got an inch clearaz_ce on top of yomr plss."
"yeah, i'll - i'll be quiet - -"
"yes, because i think it's loose - -"
take mine out now. wonder if i got any zaps when i was out there?
good show.
"yes, 35; just a second. i want to get it, but i ain't going to put that in the clock. i'm right- handed. w."
"houston, apollo 11. ready to copy pericynthion plus 2."
"*** up on the rim, gene, and see what we've got. tiptoe through the tulips (singing) - -"
yes. 05 05 35 50 i_mp-eva let me go over and deploy the sunshield on it then.
okay; i think we're in business. we'll want 15 volts to primary and forward steering to bus a when you start off.
"okay_ let's use the verb 23, enter. oh, what did i do there. enter, let's see, is a 110. there, okay. verb 25 - enter. oh_ gamma prime leonis. (coughing) okay, minus 8490 - 84900, i mean; plus 40299, plus 40299, enter; plus 34176, plus - 76, enter; okay, proceed. 202 ... 18, okay. there already .... i guess. we'll try that one more time .... cmc, auto? 196306, ..."
"say, houston; 15."
"gordy, this is jack. looks like the windows have cleared up pretty well in ptc from the - ice crystals, anyway, that were on window - window 1. the hatch window still seems to have a film of something on it. but, otherwise, they look pretty good."
"okay, all turned off now."
"no, i forgot. i forgot."
...
"yes, i'm going to head more straight up the hill. once i get up on top, i'll be all right. i'm going to head down in this hole and then up that way."
"yes, some of those masses of what i suspect are cumulus buildups - well, not really. they don't look like they're as concentrated and localized. more like just masses of fairly dense clouds that are developing in that band of green that crosses the lower portion of africa."
roger. apollo 16 air-to-ground voice transcription
"i'm sorry. *** fell, too."
and i've got the cross feed on.
okay. yes.
seven minutes -
"yes, that's right."
"roger, pete and al_ we copy. we suggest you start smoking on back there. you're 3:13, and i'd like you back there in 4 minutes."
i wore my hand out holding that camera together coming out here.
looks like a pretty good location to sample the rim materials of this crater.
"houston, this is 16. over."
"t-start is 128:19:09, 128:20:47."
roger.
okay. you should be about halfway to survey.
right on the couch.
sounds good.
... thank you. get in there in a minute. let's see.
"okay, []ack. the f',,,lr{ procedut'e's okay, anco, lhen we had to fsoback to the ih and do something. and the first line is okay, cross out ""bat 5 and 6 off,"" delete that. and delete tile ne×t line also, that says ""?am_] ]] to 16 ascent eca control, open."" then we had a couple of notes which remain the same. go ahead. 04 ]4 59 20 cmp okay. i didn't get the notes, but i'll read you the steps as i haw.= them now. one step, bat 1, 2, 3, and 4 ... and at this point should have batteries 2, 2, 3, 4, and 6 on. is that affirmat 5ye? 04 14 59 -_9 cc that's affirmative. so now we have bat 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, on, and i got two notes. number 1 is: your csreuit breaker protection limits - your clrcuit breaker protection - limits the current to 15 amps. n_raber 2 note is: now the umbilical between the lm and the command module"
on the bit goes beta.
"okay, dave. go - go back to whatever cooling you want."
the rim block population is not much dif - the rim block population is not much different than the average for the terrain in here.
"okay. cross out the ""125"" and put in ""1 slash 60."""
"four jets; 14 seconds. 03 13 55 07 cml° hey, how's our reading - four - four jets; 14 seconds."
how far that is -
"may be two or three pages of stuff we missed, charlie. 07 07 16 07 _p okay. i got it."
okay.
"landing radar breaker, open. checking the water. _ad, gordy, ascent tank l, we started out a little low. it's still - same place. that's water."
... sep light.
right now. we'll do it.
"and, ken, awhile ago you were reporting loud back- ground noise. we'd like to ask you how the comm is now. 06 09 16 43 cm2p sounds great."
okay. 10 12 14 37 l_ and then we can - -
"roger, dave. and how far away do you think that might be. it sounds very exciting. 04 ll l0 15 cdr-seva joe, distances are very deceiving. i'd guess maybe 60, 70 meters. there's another somewhat deeper one just to the north of that. it - it looks to me, and jim has the same impression looking out the window, that we're much closer to pluton and - and st. george, and all that stuff_ than we expected to be."
"man, those thrusters are bright."
okay. i'll ask him.
125 is good. and the rest of the flags.
the longest napierian trajectory in the world.
"roger, dave."
"the up - the update on the ordeal ball was a good one. at the burn, we were about - just about 8 degrees. we had to pitch down. the yaw was right on all the way through the entire burn, and just towards the end of the burn, the ball started going black in pitch a little bit."
"say, gordo, gordo, gordo. hey, gordo - -"
okay.
right. we'll stop it when we're setting up our tv.
and we are ready to copy on the loi-1.
go ahead.
okay. 352 for yaw. that's correct.
and a maneuver of - and a maneuver of 51.3. (eagle )
okay. system a is on.
we see you raised the cover on the abort stage. we don't recommend that.
"you're about 30 degrees above our horizon now, houston. and you're about one-third-cresent moon, and you really are beautiful. see blues and whites."
"and, houston, we've done a lm/cm delta-pi ando at time 4 hours and 30 minutes, we had a plus 0.6."
"okay, and--"
we're not - we're not sure. we kind of think that may be what 's happening.
are getting kind of what?
... data back and you're looking good.
"okay. at 150:10, delete the pan camera photo pad."
"ron, let me interrupt here. say the name of the crater you're looking at again in smythii."
let me turn around this way.
"and as you can see, we're in 170.4 by 58.3 according to the old computer, and that baby just rifled it right down the line."
(laughter)
- - 2.1.
and mou_t the dac on the sextant.
"- - into gatsby, because it looks like the mantle stream_ over the - the side from the southwest. can you swing to your right - get up a little closer to the rim, there?"
... 04 11 29 35 _4p okay. time skip
"well, there's a crater over there. it's true, yes."
possibly - -
"bob, i may have moved the high gain. do you see any change in signal?"
hold it there. let me get your - keep - keep coming down. i'll push this in. okay.
it - it's pertinent beginning at 271. we probably ought to get it in before the press conference at 270.
i think i'm losing my mind.
that was 160.09.
"okay,"
okay.
i ain't answering them. ll 01 47 b2 lmp it's my side. ll 01 47 bb cmp okay.
okay; i'm back at the capsule to visual.
"gamma ray, shield, on."
"- - and separation. what is it, john?"
okay. plus 29 and 27.
go ahead.
"okay, bob. for the alfmed, cdr will be in the left seat. cmp will be in the center seat with the alfmed. for our reporting, when we get the vox, we'll just call out our first names to shorten it and the comments following. and jack will be recording."
"we're watching gene, right now. you disappeared out of sight a long while ago. hey, you just came into sight again, jack."
there we go.
roger.
"hit it harder. hit it harder, please."
okay.
"okay, jack. on this pass, the earth comte into the view at the top part of the inp's window, and we got an lpd angle on it as it passed through the cdr's window of a minus 4 degrees."
"yeah, you - it - it's like - three guys - they've each got a window, and we're staring at - at the ground. it's really - boy, this has got to be the neatest way to make a living anybody's ever invented."
"okay. apollo 15, houston. turn your mapping camera, off."
"fred, go to descent 02 ."
i'm waiting until 45. 0h 13 07 31 cdr okay.
okay. cgnfiden1'!.a
sure would like to do some more geology up here someday.
"okay. the upper - below that skim, the next 5 centimeters. put it down, geno."
"okay, jack. i'm going to leave the gnomon right here."
roger.
that's obvious by now.
does it look like - is it a feature on the ground or a feature in the clouds?
good.
"yes. i got it. okay, i think we have everything. all set, buddy?"
right.
... is three-quarter overburn.
"everytime i focus on f crater (laughter) i jiggle a little bit, and i can't focus."
two lights.
"okay. now, we're at ei minus 2 plus 30; we're going to panel 5: circuit breaker essential instrumentation, main a, closed."
"okay, tank pressures are still good."
"okay, orion - - 04 00 37 08 lmlp-lm and, jim, the ags is loaded with the data card - go ahead."
"okay, that's complete."
oh - be careful -
"in fact, i'm convinced of that. and, okay - that's two stereo from 7 feet."
"okay. 04 08 17 lb lmp if no ignition, you start pushbutton, if we get ullage."
"it's just in one suit, too, for some reason. (eagle)"
what do you mean?
"that's affirmative. that means no maneuvers between now and midcourse 7- and this is a horizontal in-plane burn, plus x, toward the sun, 19.3 feet per second."
"i'm saying all of them look clean again. i guess they've fired so clean that they don't seem to ... at all .... different color, ... copper, bronze, color of the oxygen cell. they've been fired be- cause i watched them f_re. okay. the earth's going by at an lpd of 42."
okay.
"well, i'll tell you what i'm going to do. *** to steady the 500, and see what happens."
"! hope you're right. o_ 03 27 28 cdr we ain't gonna do any eva today, either. 04 03 27 30 i_p you don't want to?"
"okay, houston; we're about one dliameter to the east of north triplet."
"man, look at those stars. houston."
"oh, yes. i got a satisfactory - every once in a while, i can hear them now; they're cutting in and out somewhere, and i don't know where. da_ 5 i _'' 1-13"
"okay, the rendezvous radar operate heater should be closed at this time."
"photo vernier engine bay a, f:ll, 5 feet, one picture."
"okay, you got it."
that - that's affirm.
roger.
i - i need mine?
yes.
"this water is a lot less airy, after i got the first few gulps out. t"
two.
okay.
okay. we are pretty close to 000. is that all right?
"other than that, we're kind of helpless (laughter)."
"okay, stand by 1. okay, houston. it looks like we have a slow repress start. we're up to about - 22 or 23 on the fuel pressure. okay; orb rate, inertial."
"circuit breaker logic power, two, close. two, close. logic power, two, to jettison. oh, i'd hate to do this."
okay. we got the cover closed. 08 05 42 07 cnp okay. the jets are configured.
okay. that's probably a good idea (chuckle).
"stand by. roger. let's go ahead. 07 06 23 29 cdr-_ okay, you got 1.4 on the agc, transmitter power is 3.4, shaft error is 2.1 to 2.65, trunnion error is 2.2 to 2.65."
"okay, dick. do your usual good job."
okay. we got to close the primary h20. 05 06 o1 47 cdr-iai okay.
okay?
roger. sep light.
"well, we don't have anything else, do we?"
"well, we just waited - -"
"jack, watch these srcs. i don't like the lock on this cable very well."

mark; 05:30.
"okay. you're talking about the check at 74 hours get, right?"
you want me to hold it longer?
"copied. 78:23:31, 78:33:27, 78:55:03, 78:46:44."
...
"well, i'm thinking about the last l0 hours. we've lost our suit compressors."
"jim, this is houston. could you verify for us, please, that one of the two dump valves is open?"
"okay, how is the ranging check gcing?"
"read you. for the verb 49 that occurs at 223:51, change the numbers to ""127, 270, and 030."""

wait. where?
"hey, dick, we got enough to keep us busy for months and months and months, as you well know."
"right down the line of sight. you want the 59? probably not. okay, now, let's get a clock. turn it at 56 - 2. why don't i plot another point?"
"okay? he's getting copernicus again, al; he's rolling back."
it sure is. that's just right between the eyeballs.

"no, sir. it was open."
you hetcha.
"houston. okay, we just got the signal strength on orion. time skip 02 21 40 19 cs{p that's where not having had an opportunity to fly all these things really leaves me uncomfortable."
there is probably as big blocks there as anywhere on the rim that we've seen.
"roger, pete. stand by."
"okay, i'm looking - right there."
"okay. at sun half-unit vectors, x, ri, is plus 0.45498, y plus 19024, z plus 08250. over."
"16, can you verify that the subsatellite deployed on time?"
"it certainly comes out easier, doesn't it? i mean like you're going to have to - ... that way - that's right, because this place is fuller than the mock- up ever was."
"okay, karl. you got narrow."
"yes. 06 02 12 54 irp-eva - - if we're going downslope, i'll just hang on."
it's a mighty big ocean.
c_py. minus 16 and 58.
i'm watching.
"okay, 835 miles. and climbing out like a dingbat."
"okay, fine. that's the way the instructions were, originally."
casper we read you loud and clear. do you read me?
"did you copy that, houston? the range is 710 feet, 2 feet per second, rates nulled. houston, did you copy casper?"
okay s fine.
"now, let's - can i put a bag around it?"
copy that.
"okay, good show."
"dave, could you hold that one?"
"hey, baby."
right on descartes.

"okay, when it gets all the way down, i'll partially open the forward hatch, so you can come back up."
roger.
"well, if you want, dave, i can take your camera and do all the documentation pictures."
okay. 05 21 50 20 i24p ... good. il it confidenti/ 6 05 21 50 21 cdf okay. thank you. about 225 to go; out of plane looks good. 05 21 50 29 l_ it looks good. that's good.
it's a 20-foot-diameter crater?
"okay, ken, you can go ahead and disregard the intervalometer and try to get them both on that same mag."
let me get a quick shot here. about 15 feet and i'll shoot.
"i hope so, charlie."
but at what scale?
(laughter) was that consoliaa_ea jackpot?
"america, houston. the state vector up-link scheduled for now won't be necessary."
yeah. we're in the attitude i'll be in for - 6 days. yep.
okay.
"it's just four lines. go to activation 1, do step 3. go to activation 11, omit step 1. do activation 12, and then go to activation 13 and do step 1. do you copy?"
"okay. mode select, landing radar."
"okay. that's all right. that just said it wasn't an lgc. that just says defer a lockon. that's all right. okay. radar test, off."
you bet. slurp-slurp.
"it's all material though, that could be - it's material that could be knocked in there by the local impact."
"just wait until you see the snowman, pete, babe."
copy that.
"okay, we'll stop it on 146 roll."
there. i'll - -
it comes again.
"okay. we copy. does the ridge system cross the color boundary, ron, in crisium?"
"okay. okay, all i've got to do is get these guys back to rate command and go to cmc, and i'll do that soon as we start to pick up a little aerodynamics."
"bob, that's a - a fantastic black-and-white shot of the landing area with the shadow stretching across most of it."
program alarm reset.
"endeavour, the computer's yours."
"and, 17, if you guys are interested, your shadows will be 8 feet long tonight."
nothing.
plss mode _?
you want 2 seconds at 24 frames.
okay. i've got that.
"okay, 50. and we'll be into our tli checklist, and - we'll be ready for that pyro arm."
"okay, bravo 1, 15048; bravo 3, 6-1/2 - the best yet; bravo 4, none. on the menu side, the happy gourmet says that meal a for cmp was a large orange juice with potassium. meal b was - and then breakfast, a chocolate bar, sugar cookies, and another citrus beverage with potassium. meal c - chicken and rice, two orange drinks, fruit cocktail, pineapple fruitcake. i got - i guess yesterday morning - for the commander, you can delete the peaches, you can delete the grits on the lmp. you can delete the peaches, you can delete the eggs, and you can add an extra orange- pineapple with potassium."
okay.
"orion, this is houston. will you give us another range and range rate, john?"
"go ahead, joe."
negative on that. you're perking along real well. and we're following your progress. it looks as though you're getting the job done.
really!
okay.
"can't tell, i can't see the lip of the rille."
"we just turned it off, hank."
command module docking light. okay. you got them. they're in.
okay.
"okay, rhc and thc armed?"
buster is a real impressive crater.
"read you the same. okay. plss mode, both of them, ar."
"and whatever that surface was is all shredded, and .-as i said, like shredded wheat, and it's continually spitting particles off."
"roger, dave. we got them. thank you."
roger. that's correct.
"okay, now, jim. that was a little bit too fast but i think i got it all. 098:47:00.00; plus 0102.3, plus all balls, minus 0050.0; 0138.0; plus 0011.0, 0113.9; 0:35, all balls, 273; 5927.0; 0127.60, plus all balls, minus 0049.4; 099:35 all balls; 101:22:15.00. lm- that's throttle profile is 10 percent for 26 seconds in full throttle. lm weight, 36673. go ahead."
right on top of the surface - -
"while you're waiting there, i can go over the foot- ball scores for the weekend, if you wish. i24p just a minute. let's see if we can get ron on a headset."
"okay, i see you on this side. john, you know you lost your little plate? tony, on that one bag dispenser - that - on john's camera - the little ring came off of it, and the bags are just dangling loose, but we'll be able to use it still."
"okay, ron."
roger.
you want me to go free now?
... good show. -- 04 06 48 31 cmp fantastic. (columbia) i_ '_'04 06 48 32 lmp engine stop-reset. (tranq)

it's not - it's not here by the treadle. so all i'll do is pick up - pick up the treadle?
"#** that, commander."
"houston, endeavour. go ahead."
"this was for jack and gene. the trench has computed the s-ivb location in reference to your body axis; and the azimuth was within i degree, very close, and the - we calculate it should have been out of that window at 62 degrees from the x-axis, and you reported 45 degrees, which is just a 17-degree error. it's real close there. you know, just eyeballing it like that."
we got to find sharp crater first.
"yes, i'm up in the tunnel, but go ahead."
(laughter) i'll bet.
you're kidding.
"panel 275, all open; no exceptions."
"apollo 17, houston. good morning."
"okay. stand by. 0)405 53 24 cc okay, jack. there are two - there's a switch and a circuit breaker that were positioned this morning that we'd ±i_e to have you check - correction, just the switch. panel 5, check your bus tie. main bus tie bat b/c on."
"okay. stand by for 2 minutes, john."
"say again, jack."
is that mag hooked up?
get the location shot here.
okay.

"okay, let me get these in a bag here."
it's coming down.
"about t2, casper."
"go ahead, charlie. 05 07 20 38 lmp-_ okay. we just picked up a pretty high-pitched hum in the - in the ecs loop. would you have them take a look."
*** stu. i'm ready to start my ags cal.
now get the other side.
so don't bury them.
... how's the ...?
"that's affirmative, charlie."
okay. how mauy did you have to start with?
"your hoses are stowed? tape 108a/_ i_p-lm they'_e stowed, cdr-i_ okay, connect your o_ hose, a_d i'll get you a number 211. i_p-i_ let me turn around so y don't - -"
"okay; that's good, men. all the way in. good show."
didn't break ?. good. i think that will survive going back now.
"like that. okay; that's easy enough to do. 05 06 01 30 i_mp-lm okay, and then - -"
"gene, yes, we're doing this now, and we need a t-stop here, at this time - on the pan camera."
"yes. i can't reset it, and a minute later she's coming up with a blink on sps pressure."
_at?
(laughter)
that's good.
313.
why don't we show them the lunar eclipse?
"stay at 16 now. ecs suit fan 2, closed?"
"geno, those angles are okay."
"sounds like pretty good duty, bob. 02 21 51 lb lmp houston, 17."
roger. we'll do that.
oh - beautiful. fine.
"okay. i've opened the tunnel vent, and i'm gonna bring my roll engines on, and you're clear to check your relief valve."
"okay, ken, we have voice/ranging back on. how do you read?"
"okay. doesn't register on the g meter (laughter). okay, gimbals are still steady."
"that looks good. okay, come here! i've got some- thing for you. let's go."
"chamber pressure on bank a started out at about 87. bank b brought it up to about 92, 93. and when i first sat down, it was reading 0, now it's reading 5."
did you say not soon?
i don't have anything.
roger. you're loud and clear.
"ah, plop."
that's interesting. i don't know how it got off attitude.
yeah.
"oh, time; i'm sorry."
(laughter)

"houston, 15."
"houston, did you copy noun 05, and are you look- (tranq) ing at 93? over."
"yes, i don't understand how - why we have so much time."
okay. check m_flens.
"oh, boy."
"ken, the sim bay's warmed up and - it looks like we give the computer and the software a clean bill of health. and we're suspecting we might of had a - a transient or something in the cdus, so g&c would like to maneuver back to about the attitude where we had this thing and sweep out plus or minus 5 degrees in each axis one at a time and see if we can get another glitch. now, we're trying to search those low-order bits because we think that's where the problem occurred. the attitude is 1.82.5, 130.7, 039.7, and we'd like for you to stay'in scs."
"davy, you're going to have to realine our antenna, please."
okay.
"roger. the weight of the rcu was 12 ounces. (tranq) that was by itself without the bag, and the weight of the water from the cdr's plss was 12-1/2 ounces. that's reading zero with the bag on."
"well, we're at 094, 1.7."
"okay. we're going - i - i want you to move seven of the lines from 30:30 to 28:20. and those seven lines are: the sm sector i sm/ac power, on; pan camera power, boost; map camera image motion, off; map camera, on, standby; h2 and 02 fuel cell purge; waste water dump; and, at 28:35, h2 purge line heaters, off."
"and, jim; this is houston. could you adjust your s-band volume for us, please? you have a side tone squeal when you transmit and the - the volume is - is fairly weak for us. give us a count before you do it and after you do it. and would you reverify the delta-vy for us? over."
that's verified. auto and power.
mag's jammed ....
forty-five.
roger.
"oh, look at that. it's like a picture."
"well, one thing about it, tony with one suit on and one suit off a day, i_ - you don't have to wcrry about your exercise periods."
"okay, wait a minute. 05 06 28 04 lmp-_ okay, you'll have to move up, john, a little bit if you can. can you?"
okay.
"okay, houston; 17 here. is there enough film in there to allow me to keep the camera running while i try to fill up that flow pattern."
"well, we wanted them to turn it over, but they decided against it. 06 23 09 22 c}gp did they make any comment on what the material looked like on their drive up to north ray?"
"- - it sounds a little scratchy to us too, but the czar likes it."
"it's 268:02. 10 0b 20 10 _ no, 08. · ~ .."
"no, it won't go."
- taking a look at the pretty scenery.
"okay. 134 50. thank you. 05 il 08 29 cc yes, sir."
well. it looks to me like it's about - we started out at about 95 percent and we're down to about 90 percent.
wait a minute. here you go.
is that too far down?
okay .... load it with ... 00 01 21 37 ia{p yes.
"okay, wait a second."
"houston, 15; go ahead."
"at 2 minutes, i'll get the master arm."
okay. we read you loud and clear.
"okay, copy that. and i guess we'd suggest that, if you haven't talked about it already, that you _tork on the fender before you do the geo prep. you don't have your cameras and bags to worry about at that point."
okay_ houston. we have a successful svar check.
copy that.
let me check and see what we got on that. i wasn't here when you first talked about it evidently.
"... off and receiver, on."
"oh, look at that."
roger.
"no, but you can put it in mine. can you reach it?"
closed.

yes.
"why don't we go to the upper rim up there and pick up the core, joe - jim, on the way back up?"
that's affirmative. 09 01 09 02 cml° okay. now i've got a minus 34 and 218. shouldn't that track throughout the maneuver? it used to. the old angles did.
"okay; 15 minutes, i'm going bats 2 and 4 - okay, houston. can i take bats 2 and 4 off now?"
enable.
yes.
"overhead or forward are open, then auto at 3-1/2 ... get, charlie?"
"okay, crew status is all good, no medications. and i've got the onboard read-outs if you've got a pencil. _ 10 12 20 31 cc i've got a pencil."
okay. we'll look at it some more. your comm down to us is excellent now.
"okay. good, good."
"okay, we'll let's - let's do this and get out of here - -"
"and, as a matter of fact, i have - mount la hire seems to be in view now and looks like i'm heading right at it."
"#** give them. houston, cdr is reading - 90 - 91 percent."
"and, endeavour, i'll be standing by for when you're ready to copy down the few changes in your flight plan for today. i can bring you up to date over /-_' the next 7 hours or so and get all that out of the way. i'm also curious to know if you've had time to listen to any sea chanties from the hms endeavour up there. over."
"good ship endeavour, this is houston. we'll see you on the other side."
pan camera power is going to boost.
roger.
"hey, stu, i notice that this thing keys an awful lot at any sharp sound in the cockpit. if this is getting annoying, i'll turn the vox level down."
"it ought to - i think you're the one that's going to be looking into the sun, because we're in - in an inertial attitude and i was looking at the sun at sunset. i think the sun's going to rise over my back."
merlin. merlin the magician.
this thing pulled so hard that it pulled the central station.
"ken, we understand that mag zz is in the nikon, and fao says that ought to have plenty of film to do the gum nebula. 05 21 53 30 cml° okay. fine. thank you, sir. (no comm for 41 minutes)"
"apollo ll, houston. it appears to us that wetre seeing a view from outside plus a little of the inside. it appears you've taken the camera away from the left window now. over."

okay.
roger.
"go ahead, houston."
"okay, orion. go ahead. 06 18 48 23 l_-lm okay. for john, yesterday he had day 7, meal a; and day 7 - stand by - and day 7, meal b, he ate every - on day 7 meal a, he ate everything but the beef steak. on meal b, he ate everything but the romaine soup and the butterscotch pudding. he had no medication, and he'd like for the docs to guess how much sleep he had to start with, and then we'll give you our estimate. for me, we had day - the same two meals; i ate everything on meal a except the bacon squares and on meal b everything but the romaine soup and the butterscotch pudding. i had no medication, and i slept for 7 hours. over."
"okay, dave. i - guess you pick up business as usual then. and we're standing by. however - dave, could you put pressure on the lower of your three ekg sensors? we think that may be the problem with our signal down here. and that's just pressure on that sensor from the outside."
_m.s says we're going to have a slight overshoot.
"okay, buzz. we see the card up now."
...
"16, houston."
roger. challenger's high bit rate. how do you read high bit rate?
"well, thank you. i wonder how - how that one happened. i tell you it's pretty easy to kick a switch when you're rolling around in here. you chase a piece of the flight plan away from you or you kick a camera, and that's not an unusual thing to happen. i appreciate you telling me about it."
"challenger, houston. just a reminder. before you stow the right-hand 0ps on the floor, you need to attach the floor hole cover."
"houston, 13."
"and ask why: i mean, because we got some of these things stowed where you wouldn't believe. it's not gonna be too easy. we're gonna have to take the entry stowage apart to get at them."
"- - somebody else's glitch. well, that's part of the statistics, i guess. one in a million, when you've had yours, don't mean that you ain't gonna get the - that somebody hadn't gone 2 million hours without a - -"
okay. good deal.
"t-start for lunar eclipse photos, 268:59:47."
okay.
"okay. i'm going to start pitching around again, and i'll see if i can pick them up. i have orion out here to my left a little bit, but it's pretty close to the - oh, here. i've got sirius. that's a nice one. tiow about that?"
okay. 04 04 29 00 cn_p is the rate staj_ting to build now? i'm trying to calibrate the dead-band activity here so i can tell what the rate - when it's really a rate and when it's just dead banding.
"okay, vance. i got the stowage list now."
"i'm looking out here now at the area just to i west of the south of lassell e on a little highlands there. and if you go straight south from lassell, there's a little tip of highlands material that runs out to the west. then it stops, and if you take from there and draw a line, i would guess it's almost due west. it looks like there's two entirely different materials there. like you built it out of two fabrics and then put it down. the one to the north is darker than the one to the south. it's - it's split by a very straight line, and there's a - a very distinct difference in the - in the albedo or the shade of gray that the mare has."
were you able to copy reasonably on vox?
"no, there's an i - -"
"i don't know about you, but my suit is collapsing around me. how about you?"
"okay. i'm going to get to work in a minute, just as soon as i take a look at trident."
"houston, the passive seismometer has been deployed manually."
"we'll have to smoke to get back to that lm. we're a long way. look where we are. oh, we can make it; no strain."
can't see too good - yeah. i see what you're saying there.
"got them. okay. okay, and i'll go ahead and torque those out on the minute. just give me a mark. 09 03 30 2_ lmp okay."
"you getting the whole movie? i'll gev it. okay, i think you can orient yourself with the big basins jack's been talking about. there's crisiu_. you can see the landing site up in the - what is to me the upper left-hand corner of the pictures but you can pick it out by now, i know. get a better relationship. you're looking _ the langrenus_ down there, that bright craver. you ought to be able to see humboldt. maybe jack can give you the whole thing. _4p ... this in."
"verb 47, enter. there you go."
"okay. roger. stand by. 05 20 _1 b4 cc okay. press on, fred. 05 '20 '12 '39 i,mp okay."
"- - we're starting on page 1-2, jim."
"boy, it's all put up."
"loud and clear, cdr."
"pete and al, houston. we show you are 3 plus 35 into the eva. and you've got plenty of consumables, so we suggest you go at a relaxed hustle to get back in. 04 22 42 54 imp okay. it's almost all done. think we've got it made."

"apollo 17, hoqston. good morning."
"okay; that - that stands to reason; that not being able to see the reticle on there is a real nuisance. you can do it, and it's - i guess there is also a certain amount of getting used to the knack of flying that thing around. it's - for some reason, it seems a little bit different to find the atti- tude than it was in the simulator; but the biggest nuisance was the inability to see the reticle, but if that's where we used our extra, that's fine."
i got it.

"boy, we sure are."
"endeavour, houston. we can't get a - a data with you. we'd like you to put the dse to low bit rate, record, forward, and command reset."
"..., charlie."
okay. we copy that.
"okay. you'll find that the area arolu_d the (tranq) ladder is in a complete dark shadow si we're going to have some problem with tv, b_,t i'm sure you will see the - you'll get a picture from the lighted horizon ..."
"16, houston. can you - can you check for us and let us know whether ken is on the biomed? is ken hooked up on the biomed? we're getting some strange readings. could be a loose sensor."
go ahead.

"we sure appreciate you helping us. if you could have seen what we were looking at a couple hours ago, you wouldn't believe it. we couldn't - we had so much stuff piled up in here that none of the three of us could see each other, and that's the truth."
roger. i expect you probably have about nine (columbia cap comms and 11 flight directors with no place to plug in.
yes.
okay. (tr q.)
and after this - -
are you talking to me or you?
"yes, wait 1. go right on schedule, here. 04 13 18 24 lm_ you said it."

it looks like we've had crossover.

"dave, that's not quite right. let me read through it. we want you to get the light on, but we want you to try to first get it on just by pushing, by flexing the panel around the switch in question. and the reason we're doing that, we think - it's - the probable short is contamination in the switch, but there's a small chance that it's some sort of a problem in the wire bundle that will be flexed very slightly when you just push on the panel. so that - the note should read the following, and i'll read it clear through to the end. ""get thrust light on by pushing on panel first. if this doesn't work, rap on panel or cycle the switch un- til the light comes on. and if the light doesn't come on, we're going to delete the test."""

"roger. it looks like we're not going to have a decision on this rev, and we do have the capability of spending about five rev's in this configuration before we have to make that decision. we would like y'all to move into a stationkeeping position, and you should be at the closest point of approach at,about 100 hours. and we're recommending a csm active to move into a position and to stationkeep. and we're going to run some simulations down here on this tvc problem, and we'll get back to you."

"well, we've been debating that. we thought we'd take care of our beards tomorrow and make that one of our daily routines."
"roger. and they're going to give you a - a sec- tion of core stem, three sections long, you'll have to put that on the left-hand tray along a-1 and a-2, and secure it with - with either you i_ tiedown rope or your extra webbing in there."

"okay. 01 19 16 51 c_ okay, houston. the first thing i noticed, as soon as i opened the flow four turns, it started running out a little bit, even - even without doing the inject. okay; that's because the inject thing was open just a little bit, but it's all right."

i hope the view is as fantastic down there as it r is up here.
"yes. and it looks like there are boulders up on the side of sculptured hills, except that they aren't nearly as big as those on the north massif. the areas where the boulder source is look like they're made up of boulders no bigger than a meter maybe; whereas, the north massif boulders are up to several meters. *** boulder sources all seem to be up within a third of the height of the sculptured hills, just south of- just east of the massif *** wessex cleft. here is a boulder track that crossed the slope. ***, geno?"
- - could you verify all your flags are off?
it looks to me like you could turn it first.
mark it. barber pole.
okay.

"okay, we copy that."
"man, it's dark in herex"

"gordo, we're - we're ready any time you are for that update. and after we get the tephem and everything squared away, we'll go into alfmed."
"america, houston. just to make doubly certain that we don't get any venting from the waste tank, we would like on panel b52 the waste water relief valve to off, please."

"no, couldn't be."
if it doesn't get it again.
"roger. copy, jim. and i'm wondering if you caught sight of the small crater you saw outbound, which you described as having bedrock in the bottom?"
"it won't reach you that way, jim. you - it just - just drop it. no. no, wait. turn - 06 05 39 40 lmp-i_ dave, i'm c_ning that way, may - dom't. 06 05 40 03 i_mp-lm be easier to go in through the top."

"i think that's a negative, ed. i used option 3. stand by 1, and i'll check."
we concur.
roger. how do you read me now? over.
okay. i've got the answer now.
"okay. now, look, something's screwy on this comlki- - 05 23 04 13 _q_ burn's complete."
okay.
"oh, they are, huh?"
"5, pro, 3, 2, 1 - rage confide l day2"
"i'm not going to, but this is the time you do. i don't think we can hold it all the way."
"okay, we'll - no hurry, finish up and get cleaned up there. and the only change, we have some change in the timing as far as the checklist so we can gain back the time we're behind now, which is actually less than an hour. and the only hard- ware change other than deletions is to - that we'd like you to leave demand reg a, closed, at all times. so whenever you come across a place that says open at cabin or egress, we'd like you to leave it closed."
coming up.
okay. copy that.
"i ain't got - i ain't going to let that pass, man --"
"america, houston. we're ready for the ir to off. okay. ir's coming off - ob 09 55 b1 _ mark it. 03 09 57 16 k_p hey, gordy. who's operating in the trench in front of you today?"
"ken, we show you in free."
very close to honeysuckle.
it's reset.
"well, i don't think we'll have time."
too bad they _dn't put this panel over on al's side.
"yes. we have decided to use a canister and, you know that the liquid-cooled garment has a bag around it that we think we can use, too, or that we know we can use. we've tried it. so what you have is the - a bag within a bag and inside that is the liquid-cooled garment. the bag that is closest to the liquid-cooled garment is the one we need, and we've got two of them. and then, i'age381 of course, we've got to u_c some tsp_ and, as you say, one of the backs to flight (t_tafile time line book or something like that, a_ld,just using those materials, we can make thi!_ jerry- rigged canister. so, the bag that w_'re lookil_ for is the one that is right next to the liquid- cooled garment, and, if we're very careful about where we cut it, we cs_ make a pretty good rig."
salad?
- - on the plss fill.
"pretty good, ron. pretty good. and as you start your morning's activities, you can be aware that we were watching the spacecraft through the night, and as flight puts it, everything is swinging. 06 08 02 21 cml° outstanding. that's what we like."
okay. that's interesting.
"- - we're very scratchy. 06 14 24 08 lnp okay. 06 14 24 4b cc 11, houston. we got you back now on the high gain. did you copy all that, buzz? over."

"okay. let me get my ... 05 19 42 17 lmp-ewa we made a turn to the south a little bit at 0t_ and 5.7. are you going to try to drive up %her'_""f"
and we also remind you of getting a pan at the lower section there.
"okays bob. i missed that. i didn't give it to you; but i think - well the next bag i take out, you can check the num- well, wait a minute, i'll do it for you."
you want me to put you on the surface?
okay.
"roger, jim. copy."
"apollo 15, houston. over."
copy that.

"0kay; houston, you ready for the onboard read-out?"
"*** did. i noticed the quantity light also. i was thinking *** light, though, when i saw it. _ man."
maybe we could drive it a little bit.
"yes, the lm is visible by the way. 06 19 05 27 lmp--eva okay. i got a set of the - the - what looks like the outcrop from which the boulder came."
"okay, john. you're supposed to do a - a gdc align."
"you know, that feels funny to look down."
*** charlie.
okay.
"okay, let me take a look at all yours. okay. _lat's locked - locked, that's locked, you're vertical. that's locked. that's locked. that's locked. okay. get my helmet on. the main thing is to get this stuff back over here."
"got the core tube cap assembly, extension handle, two sets of - two sets of tongs. we have a numf.oered geophone anchor on the front. we have the tether, the gnomon, the hammer, the scoop. three core t_es, 35 bag dispensers, closeup camera, two sescs, two 70-millimeter cameras with solar ex- terior, one 16-miilimeter camera and one _g, four weigh bags, two maps, extra number geophone flag, large scoop is on, right. large scoop is on, and we're taking the trenching tool with us."
okay. slow down.
"hey, jim. jim, would you get my aux water. 06 04 19 17 imp-eva yes."
roger. we can confirm that.
stand by just a minute. we're looking at it.
"roger, geno. and i can't speak as authoritatively as some people have tonight, but for all of us around me, i'll say thank you, also."
okay. understand.
here's some more lunar orbiter.

"why don't you go home and get some sleep, bob?"
all right.
okay.
"roger. ffve-by, buzz. how me? over."

"and_ bob, the entire sky, as far as i can make it out through the hatch window, is completely filled with our twinkling flakes."
"what was your last frame number on xx, ron?"
"sounds like a winner, gene."
... thank you.
"roger. the horizon that you see - far horizon, bruce, is a ridge that seems to run around this bo_[ that we're sitting in - appears to be a ridge. it runs down from what we called ""old nameless"" to the south, and it runs to the west. it seems to be roughly circular, but, of course, we could be a little bit deceived at this point, on that - that score. the little rise you see in front of us is a rise that's shown on - on the map with - the craters are on the map. since i don't have it handy, it - i'll have to give you the coordinates later, but i think you already know them. they are about 150 feet south - south ... of the lm. go ahead."
"okay. the host rock for the inclusion, which appears to be also crystalline but may be a recrystallized rock of some kind - -"
"17, you're looking great on the final status check here, and you're go for tli. aria (rev. 2)"
"okay, i'm on. 06 01 20 35 ia{p-eva did you get the other strap in? here, let me strap you in. dave?"

"roger, columbia on charlie. how do you read? (columbia)"
"okay, bob. we'll make an effort to get those prds. we can get one of them, probably, without too much trouble. but it's a case of restowing both those suits to get the second one, we're not going to get it until eva day. i'm sorry, but that's it."
"oh, i know - hey, how about giving me - do i have g&n power at 8:217 00 00 41 07 i2_p yes, sir."

okay; it's left.
"number 1, yaw."

"hello, houston. how do you read?"
there's a nice rock right there.
yeah.
"... sleep, jim? 08 t9 54 45 lmp pretty good. i just woke up once."

"that's affirmative; otherwise, good readback."

roger. we read you about three-by now. over.
*** approaching bo seconds. blank dsky.
"all set to go. 509 is out, i'm in attitude, and we must be right, i'm going sideways."
"i don't think this is going to show anything, but i'll give it a go."
where are you?
"if you can turn around - okay, back into your cor- ner. let me get back into my corner. there. now i think you can turn around. get any further left? oh, wait. just let me try it."
"ail righty. in column a, 0id 05 change 03773 to read 03521."

"it appears that the - - o1 i0 06 ll cdr well, we can't observe much green fror the space- craft."
roger.
there's possibility we're just ....
mine's off.
roger. copy.
roger. copy. that sounds kind of like it didn't work out too well.
could you - could you see what conditions i need to satisfy in order to do that?
"yes, back up a little bit now. just back up a little bit. go in reverse. you. that's good, right there."
"okay. after ignition confirmed, cb sps pilot valve a - main a, open. that's - just about what you gave us in the notes."
okay.
is that your camera running? every once in a while?
you say you'd set your ...?
"okay. let me check on it, ron?"
"that's a good idea. let's just swing it around - let me get this side here. let's just swing it clockwise for about - why don't you grab the handle over there and let's just swing it clockwise for about 15, 20 degrees."
what's your problem?
"okay, jim. we are laying for you on that one; it is a subject that we wanted to - to bring up with you. we have been considering it _ and our feelings are - of course, it is up to you, but as we see the pros and cons, you just put your finger on tilepro. we do a hatch integrity check shortly before ei minus 1 hours, and if we bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling into the suits. on the other hand, the disad- vantages of wearing the suits are that they might slow you down considerably, not even counting the time to don them, and someone is even very concerned that after such and such a period of time in the suits, you might get too warm, and we might have to power up the suit loop to ventilate the suits and we don't particularly want to do that because it cost quite a bit of power. consequent- ly, our recommendation was going to be that you not wear the suit, since we have no reason to believe that the integrity check will show us anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and we can certainly hack that. what do you think? over."
"did you get that, charlie?"
okay; red to red and blue to *** position mikes; don the helmets.
*** listening.
"okay, it's going to be bl_.t end forward. 03 15 50 16 cffp )_at?"

okay. bag 411.
"okay, that's very good. then we've done all we - we've done all we can with the 16, and i don't know what you've done with jimmv's 70 millimeter. but the only thing we can assess - suggest from down here - if there's still - the mags still has ex- posures left, play the game with the two white windows on the camera and the magazine. and if that mag doesn't work, try to find one that does, i guess. 06 07 34 36 cdr-im okay. we haven't had a chance to exercise it yet, but we'll go through everything we can figure, and if it doesn't work, we'll give you a call."
"okay. okay, houston, the number of blocks plotted on the map are not nearly enough. in the greater than 1-meter range, there are many hundred blocks on the flank - on the massif flank of nansen and up around station 2, where we are. there are only one or two blocks on the light mantle side of nansen. it looks as if the material in the bottom of nansen is overriding the light mantle materials of the north wall. that's just an impression. there's slightly lighter albedo than the north wall of nansen."
stand by for aos.
"laser altimeter, off, please."
"okay. that, or he may want to skip one of the 60-second exposures in there somewhere, you know."
that's that good high-calorie iodine in it that does that for you.

balance couple_ on.
"apollo 13, go ahead."
"that's correct. and, of course, when we turn, they dig in, and it makes the rear end break out. but it's okay; we can handle it. _"
"yes, you might have some 38s waiting for us in la; we can pick them up there."
"tiouston, eagle, lmp. how do you read? over."
you can put this in it. this you give me goes in the isa _op pocket.
that's the tampa-label on the film cassette.
"15, houston. we're looking now at the best pro- cedure for getting the water system operating again. in the meantime, we trust you have your hands full of water up there."

okay. let's do an enter on that.

you got it from here? okay.
"that's very true. i've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can aprreciate the rain we're getting right now. (goss net 1) tape 112/3 07 05 39 34 _mi_ that was nell. this is buzz, here. i wi:;h we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. over."
your voice is excellent.
"now, i'm back to cabin."
"oh, yeah; wait 1."
... at 045.
"hey, that was a no sweat. you know that?"
roger. understand. we'll charge until the sleep period on b and delete the battery a charge.
"okay. you can see the landing site there at - down about 4 o'clock, and the 7-kilometer crater in the - on the centerline of the page, about a third of the way down from the top, the large bright crater there is - is littrow b is the name of it."
...
"... whenever you're ready for the geology, ... l0 09 21 16 58 cm_ ready, john?"
"according to hoyle, down to seconds .... da and - now, you think that'll be on this?"
yeah. tape82/1_
"endeavour, houston. turn the map camera back on, please. and it's not necessary to extend it."
"okay. geno mentioned that you'd already essentially taped the electronic part to your snoopy hat. i guess, first of all, we're suggesting that you rig - rig this up for jack, and let you have the good one just to be sure. and i'll - i'll quickly run through the steps we have. i think maybe this will be the easiest way. and you can then listen and - if you've done it already or if you - if this men- tions something that you haven't thought of, it'll at least accomplish the job. they have about 15 steps here, but i don't think it'll take long to summarize it. they suggest taking the headband off the lightweight headset; in other words, taking the electronic part off the headband, straighten the mike boom, and straighten the - the comm carrier boom, the appropriate one for whichever ear jack wears his molded earpiece in, then rotate the lightweight headset mike boom 90 degrees. they found that was necessary to get it to face your mouth when - when you end up with this all taped on there. you have to sort of twist it, force it 90 degrees. then lay the lightweight headset boom along the comm carrier boom with the electronic part on the outside of your - your earpiece on the snoopy hat. and the - the hose that goes to the molded earpiece facing downward coming out down and with the - the mike boom i inch beyond the comm carrier mike boom tip. and then tape the two booms together for the entire length of the co-w, carrier boom. and then rebend the whole works back so that the tip is back in front of your mouth. and then tape the electronics box onto the side of the ear- piece, and you can run tape all the way around the lower part of the earpiece, and you can lift up on the leather-covered doughnuts on the inside there, pull that loose and then run tape underneath. just pull the lower part of it loose, run tape all the way around to really securely anchor the electronics box to the outside of the - the earpiece so there's no chance that that will slip off or shift. then you can kind of push the leather earseal back down on top of the tape inside. let's see. then - -"
i don't see why not.
"recorder, on."
"okay, charlie. i put the big rock bag on the ladder hook."
"yes, it's pretty easy to break up; it's really not very coherent at all."
open balance load cross tie breaker on 16. roger.
yes.
"okay, here comes the count. 10, 9 - -"
take a look the next time around.
there's a lot of ... up here.
"photo-1. splashdown at this time. the three i chutes are displaced. they're in the water. _ 05 22 55 12 r-1 ... recovery, i have a clock - - i end of transcription"
"okay. if you can't reach it, i guess i can."

"not sideways, it wouldn't be."

i'll give you a hack. 10 04 20 52 cml° - - at rrt.

all we can - -
"okay, jack. and, we see your main bus b voltage at 28-1/2. 01405 56 17 cmp okay. you can see it. good. okay then. okay, vance. that circuit breaker is in. oh 05 56 28 cc copy."
another 25 minutes.
"oh, i'd say sloppy, charlie. let me try that one again. 01 l0 08 [2 cc you'll never beat out the thunderbird. 01 l0 08 _7 cc apollo ll, houston. that practice did you some good. it's looking - real smooth roll, there. 01 l0 08 _3 cc oops! spoke too soon. 01 l0 08 ._3 cdr i'm making myself seasick doing it, charlie. i'll just put you back rightside-up wh(_re you belong. o1 l0 08 '_8 cc roger. 01 10 09 i_l cdr you don't get to do that every day. o1 l0 09 h2 cc ll, houston. could you describe, from your view, the polar eloudcap? [t appears to us _;oextend down the western coast of north america. would you estimate how far it extends down? over."
that's what makes it a challenge. (laughter)
"cue cards have _ no. we have no intertions of competing with the professionals, believe me. we are very comfortable up here, though. we do have a happy home. there's plenty of room for the three of us and i think we're all learn- ing to find our favorite little corner to sit in. zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home."
"okay, now, earlier we had deleted that ""tape recorder, high bit rate"" line there and added it back on the hack page, and i guess now we need to move it back."
"get it - off your - okays when you're ready, you can dust me off."
"okay, they're armed."
...
"that's affirm, falcon."
"and, 16, if you can copy, i've got this flight plan update; i guess we need to go ahead and get it in."
"okay. understand handover, we might lose the comm."
hope it'll fit.
okay; he's got us.
"okay. plss battery connection is locked. this plss battery is locked. battery cable is locked. antenna's locked. straps are unstrapped. 04 22 06 b5 cdr-lm sure makes a difference. oh, for goodness sake. ail right, charlie. i had no idea that was going to happen. okay. have you got that? it's too far down. what? yeah. that's awful weird, isn't it?"
you pressurized already?
"no, no. i'm not going to."
go downhill. get your feet downhill.
i think they've got their work cut out for them. are there any questions that you might want to get resolved that maybe i - were obvious to me but weren't obvious to you (laughter) before we put it all away? we're going to be closing down here in a couple of minutes.
that's affirm. i2_i°-eva you should have put the gnomon up. well -
"roger. i'm looking at them, ron, and - -"
"..., pete."
i'm gullible.
"roger. i got a sort of an outline of our plans here for the rest of the day. you might want to jot these down on your scratch pad, ken, and then you can operate on the flight plan."
okay. hold this and let me put the core tube cap back.
that's all right.
"it's really going, too, isn't it?"
"okay, houston. appreciate that. thank you, and we'll call you back."
"okay. they're seeing data. it looks sort of squirrelly and - but it looks - they want it to settle down for a little while. _ 11 lb 12 33 cmp better go vox,"
... put it on the eight ball and ... let it ...
"okay, jimmy, you're all hooked up."
okay. lmp-i_ that's in alignment only.
yeah. 05 06 l0 46 lmp-l_ i think it is just the ecs.
"okay. we're about to wind it down, ken. only two things i have for you is to go over the rendez- vous procedures and i'll let you get on through your presleep checklist and - and wipe it out for the day."
"15, this is houston."
"we'll see you on the other side, houston."
"we'd like you to think about this control mode, jim, and see if you think it might work from what you know right now. we're a little skepti- cal, but we'd like to put it to you. so, once you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in verb 16 noun 20, go to pgns minimum impulse, verb 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw rate to the right. monitor the middle gimbal on tape 42/$ pmge 233 r3 on the dsky and see if she'll kind of stabilize out. if not, the only other suggestion we've got is to go to pgns attitude hold. we'll keep the ball up until you make this evaluation."
"al, this is houston. would you confirm that you're at f/22 now?"
"yeah. 06 03 20 lb lmp-eva i don't think we can turn that one over, but i think we can turn that one over down over there."
"okay. k_en we come up, i want to be s-b_nd antenna to forward."
yes. (eagl)e
"roger. and we'd like to select your checklist angles now on the high gain, please."
"good, 16. we copy the torquing angles. they look real good."
all right .... -_ day 4 page 149
"okay; we'll sts_nd by for you. take your vitae. cvp okay. will do. okay, she's coming back around."
"okay. and, let me talk to you, jim, about pulling that core out, because there's a - i think we finally figured it out last week, how to do it."
roger. still there. listening with great delight.
"okay, charlie ...."
"yes, sir, john. you're loud and clear."
"and, dave, we need maps yet and charlie charlie off the dac."
how's it going?
greenish cast.
- - when you lift it up. okay. we need some more. there you go. wait a minute.
"we got it, dick. go ahead. 05 22 21 45 c_ roger. i've got some good torquing angles here. i guess you really don't need them, do you?"
"ail right. tape recorder, off."
okay. (laughter) 10 03 14 30 _ there we go. we can put the monitor right here.
"okay, we got a caution? 05 10 41 c0 i2_p yes - wait a minute. we do net have a caution yet."
"okay, we're going to do the navigation in scs. in other words, the marking routine; and we'll use the cmc to maneuver us into the burn attitude and set us up for the tracking. we'll burn in scs, and there are three places through here that you can activate that relay, if you're using the normal procedures. now we've got some detailed procedures we won't read to you now. if we get in that situation, we'll talk _o you a bit. but the three times that you want to watch out fcr are: kon't place the spacecraft coh_rol _' v%[c ....... optics m_o_-....i.n manual. i think you're proca.zzv pretty familiar with that one. _on _ respond _o the 204 display with spacecraft cci,ttrolin c_ic. and if you make a burn, you' 1i probably be trim_ing it with g&n. and wait until you've got your verb 16, your noun 85 display up before going back to cmc. and we can talk about it in detail, like i say, later if we need it. we've run a couple of these and they go pretty smooth. 104 08 00 53 cmp okay, stu. the way i understand the scheme is that for attitude holding, while we're doing navigation, we'll do it in scs; and when we're ready zo go to work, why, we'll do cmc maneuver to the burn atti- tude, and we'll make the burn in scs to avoid this relay again. then, we don't ever want to go to cmc control with the optics in manual, and we don't want to respond to 204 with the cmc command. _d the third one, i didn't copy."
okay. it's - is that a verify?
"oh, yes. i've seen it all the way. you can see just the peak of it all - almost all - all the time."
"iiey,jack, we need another reading. volts and amps."
okay.
"okay, and, if this s-band procedure doesn't work f:;r us, we're going to ask you to maneuver to an fd'ai avtitude, where the - the yaw angle will not have to change ana we'll see if we can lock u_ in vhat a%titude. 04 00 21 01 l_-lm roger. i understand. 04 00 21 -0 cdr-!2( }_at you got to do, char!ie_ is ... a i!_tle biv. there_ ..."
"what do you want to do, run a full test?"
"yes, through that."
did you say how we're going to get guidance? over.
"bob, this is jack."
roger. thank you.
"okay, andwe need a - we need a lower out of my bag."
"not yet. yes, go - you talk to them. i don't want you to stand up yet."
"okay, bob, my pictures are taken; i'm on the way. oh, boy, where else can you do this?"
"yes, we're supposed to rake here. we'll get those with the rake."
"okay, we're starting."
okay.
you had a good clean startup. 05 05 01 56 imp-eva okay. i'm on intermediate.
"loud and clear, joe. how me?"
"mark. right between the two eyes, seemed like. both spots."
"it's stowed, houston."
"why don't you keep grabbing a few, and i'm going to - -"
"that's the best kind, bruce."
"that's a good thought, ken. thank you, ed. the fact is that probably may think more convenient - we were going to be smart and get ahead here but, thank you."
that's right.
okay. i've got 2 minutes here.
"and, 15. roger; thank you. unfortunately, like _ everything else, the laser didn't do much good. we'd like now, mapping camera to standby; laser alti_'i'er, off. then, we'll do the retract and door, close. over."
"and, endeavour. it's your computer."
"i copy that, geno. good luck."
"okay, houston, i re - l_-lm now that's it."

"sps helium valves, ed. check two, auto. verify. 03 09 53 59 i2_ auto, barber pole. 03 09 54 00 c_? okay."
"got it, charlie."
"good night, charlie. thank you."
"15, this is houston. your astroncmer cap comm is _ getting curious to know whether you are seeing anything of the lunar eclipse. anything visible?"
give houston a call and give it to them.
yes.
"okay, i've got barjea; i've got poppy; i've got the triangle."
but it sure looks like we're looking up at some of those fellows out there.
okay. copy that.
okay.
roger. it's been a long day for all of us.
"yes, we do."
"roger, al. you're coming through loud and clear."
"okay, auto shutdo_¢n - - lmi_-lm auto shutdown."
"yeah, you got it."
"read you pretty good, fred. go ahead."
"that's affirmative. we have it up on _he eidephor now. the focus is a little bit out. we see the earth in the center of the screen. (goss net 1) tape ]00/2 still have a little white dot in the bottom of the camera, apparently. and see some land- masses in the center, at least i guess that's what it is. it's very hazy at this time on our eidephor. over."
"roger. okay. got the consumables update numbers, if you're ready to copy."
"okay, coming up on 30 seconds."
- - jim.
"okay. houston, 15. i guess - we realize the in- terest behind this and the significance of the thing and - and we'll each try and describe what we saw in the way of the flashes. and i think - because of the randomnum - randomness of the flashes, it was probably better to let us go ahead and work out the events on the dse. and i think, also, you'll find on the dse, when you review the tape, that we've come up with a little scheme to give you some quantitative data, which may or not- may not be the best. and if you have any suggestions on future tests or how we can make it a little better for you, we'd be glad to hear that. as to our po- sitions in the spacecraft, we're in our launch - regular and launch positions; i'm in the left, and f al's in the center, and jim's in the right. do you still copy? apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcriptions"
"right there in front of you, jim. that big one. get - get that one."
"negative. they want to see if it'll stablize. 08 23 08 21 _ okay. you've got - the bat b charge is terminated, and we'll watch the battery's compartment pressure."
"15, this is houston. how do you read?"
okay. ·// 04 12 16 30 cml° and i'll go see if i can get papa papa out here real fast.
we're standing by. you have the go for press.
"okay, i see a small circular object there just - just to the right of the handle, and i don't see anything covering it."
stick them into the isa then.
i don't know.
here we go.
"for you, my friend, if you'll pull out a - out of that little u compartment down there, the camera bracket."
"and, endeavour, we copy your noun 93s."
"yes, uh-huh. yes."
"now, the moon's already set according to this. ll 01 34 56 lnp no, 292 - yeah, it is - too - i never saw it."
contact.
"okay, well, let's - -"
minus 156.18. that's good.
"okay, put it on. ·00 00 40 47 cmp here, jim, can you reach the cable? ... 00 00 40 51 imp yes. i've got it now."
"and, gordy, i've got the emergency cabin pressure regs back to both."
roger. what sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? we've got the sun right behind the edge of the moon now.
"yes, we - we'll get to the moon, you say, the same g.m.t., so all our sunrise, sunset, lunar-orbit activities, and sun angle at landing will be the same. and let me - i'll - it sounds pretty good, gordo. i just want to take a look at that day that you're shortening and see what we're doing in there."
"very good, falcon. and any time you're interested in any lunchtime conversation, we've got more than enough to fill the square down here."
thank you.
"yes, that's exactly - we're getting a noise on the loop. it sounds exactly like that hasselblad. just exactly like the hasselblad, and that's what we got all during that eat period. but, you know, it gives a click, and then it sounds like its transporting film, and then another click. just t exactly like the hasselblad."
"_md i've tried it both in manual and tvc and in - in the - just th_mbwheel, and i get the same response. it could be a switch here somewhere, but - but i swear, i've checked them all - all i can. i guess i'll power them down."
42.
"okay, ratchet handle unstowed to the full exten- sion; boost to the first detent. that's good and tight going back to the first detent. okay. fold probe, looks like. yes, it's out. (singing)"
go.
"for a while, until things stabilize."
"roger. waste water at - and we got the time on that, and it will be down to 25 percent."
"hello, columbia. houston. we will not come up on the msfn relay. we'd like you to come on panel 9, turn on your vhf to tr. over."
"karl, i didn't call. i'm waiting on you."
"okay. i'm glad you said that because i don't see any indication of it moving here yet, at all."
"i've been carrying very low amps on the bat bus, and i did not see a drop. i'm carrying about 2 amps now. volts are 3 - b0.5."
i'm gonna let you get the ... i'll get the ... 167
don't - keep her going.
"stay up there in the tunnel, that way."
"pete and al, your lm shadow should be about 110 feet."
yes. should be.
"jim, whenever you're through eating and ready to copy the info, i can send you the burn rules."
- - complete.
verify af_ omni.
"yeah, let's both change. 06 04 24 21 l_mp-eva did he say both charge?"
i recall.
"... charlie? okay, charlie's got his suit on and he's all laced up, and he's got a shot of water."
we understand.
mark. one minute.
right. copy.
"roger. we read you. columbia, did you call? over."
"okay. i was going to get my down-sun, but i'm ..."
"okay. ]_4ags are caged. bus ties, jack?"
"yes, i think probably so. i don't know where we're going to put it in the command module. i'll think of something. let me see. let me put it someplace where we don't ding it. there's no place to put it. i'll lay it right here on the treadle. i guess we ought to take it back. there's more time invested in that than anything we've done. okay. get your camera."
no outcrop at all. i see some secondaries in - in the inner flank.
i don't know. 07 04 37 04 ia[p still - or - still color or movie color? 07 04 37 11 61v°5 still.
yeah.
"fao is checking into it, ken."
"okay, point it to the forward. let's see if it will - i just noticed that the film counter wasn't going."
"well, i think that's - -"
"13, houston."
mark it.
"there it is. you got it? 03 08 31 48 _ okay, the urine dump's complete."
give me the - l -
mark.
okay. we got big silver box.
"man, it's delicious."
"al, you didn't do it. god damn it!"
"go ahead, houston."
yes. c!__ i've got the one that ssarts at 24:07 '_ndenas at 38:42.
... stand by together.
"and, fredo, we're - to help further locate us, if ycu can, we're going by two very - well, fairly fresh craters. i don't think quite as fresh as the one we were just talking about. the eastmost one is fresher than - the westmost one is the freshest. they're separated about 75 to 100 feet, and they're about 25 to 30 feet across and 5 or 6 feet deep - 5 feet deep, i guess. the westmost one has got small blocks in it. the eastmost one is very smooth (heavy breathing)."
"okay. understand you want simplex a in, b - and b, o_."
"okay, that's about - that's about a 20-minute job."
"then ""atca."" 07 23 42 22 l_ yea2. 07 23 42.23 cc ""atca, open,"" and ""__at'c_(ags), or)eh."" 07, _-_°_42 28 12.'p okay."
stand by. we're still picking up ... high bit rate.
okay.
"roger. and for future reference, w_'d like - -"
"okay, jim. right on. th_k you. _ 09 o1 04 09 cc endeavour, this is houston."
burn time - i had it 1 second early. 03 t0 05 56 cdr plus 11. okay.
thank you. you've got to be careful you don't kick dirt on them once we get them setting down. i guess the way you could do it is have - have it in some sort of package - a package out on the dirt.
these little -
aah - go back and get that one.
"houston, am i keying? over."
"there's pitchover. ten seconds. ok%y, haly. *** ow_r is good. pitchover. there's auto ignition. 05 21 46 iv i2,_? boy, azldhere we're going across _]at'spaw."
_rk.
"aquarius, houston. over."
"no, i'm resting right now. didn't seem like my arms have the stamina they did yesterday to hold the artificial g. what - -"
"yes. he got a 1. 00 00 35 40 cm_ oh, hell."
"loud and clear, jack."
"okay, pete. we got you - finally had time to lock out the window and you're just coming into view again and just as pretty as ever."
"0ops, there's a heat flow probe. cdr-_a what happened? i2_p-eva (laughter) i - i messed up -"
"16, would you go ahead and start the pan camera 8_d mapping camera film cycling procedures down to the point in the checklist where it calls - where it calls for a msfn cue?"
"the - the sur - the surface boys are on the way back to the lm, completed their eva, and they're getting - they're driving back to ir right now."
look our your side window (laughter). l0 04 22 43 cml° stand by for 0.05g.
right. j-
okay.
"stand by, jack. i'll get one more word before we come back to the lm."
"okay. good. nice to talk with you. hey, i don't know whether you were around, gene, the other day when i was talking about the circulation patterns around antarctica. we were looking then at the indian ocean - actually, south atlantic in the indian ocean region. and you see the same pattern at about the same latitude, say 60 degrees south, where all the linear cloud patterns which presum- ably are - reflect the various cold fronts have - are arcuate with their convex sides, or more actually, almost pointed sides are all lined up in a west-to-east direction around that latitude. it's quite a spectacular appearing circulation pattern. and the little wave that i mentioned on new zealand seems to be beginning to form another arrow or another convex point on that front that's fitting right into the same circulation pattern."
"17, you read houston?"
that did it.
"okay. and we'll want the onboard read outs there at the bottom of the page, just before you go los. and i might pass up one little piece of news - very local news here - concerning us members of the orange team. we're all extremely proud that you and jack chose to call the soil you found the other night, while we were on shift, the orange soil because we take it as an obvious honor for the orange team to have been on shift at that point."
"okay, vance. i'm going to have to switch omnis. i'm starting to get some static here."
"okay, go ahead."
go ahead.
"well, okay. but for the time being, let's - let's just take one plan an_ run with it, and that is to update the times on every page."
gee whiz. 04 20 07 _8 cmp okay. finally got mag zz on the ole nikon.
"i can't feel it. the simulator's got a big red stripe on it. .maybe if i get my lit_ie finger in there, i can line it up. 00 00 34 08 tf_p ..."
"how you doing there, fred?"
okay. did you get my readback?
let it ride?
"okay. i'm smoking right along, gang."
"okay. the com - the command module orbit somehow is missing all the mascons. it's not de - degrading into a circular like we thought _t would. it's just staying where it was, about a 70 by 50. and so what we're planning on is an extra little maneuver about i hour prior to the normal plane change, which will lower the command module altitude at the plane change mode to - to 60. this will be about a il-feet-per-second rcs burn. and then ron will do the plane change at the normal time, but it'll be little bigger than - that we had planned. i think the last half was about 365 feet per second for plane change. and we've checked the consumables. that puts the rcs right on the preflight line. he's been running about 4 or 5 percent above it. that will use up that pad there, put him back to nor - nominal on rcs, and on the sps, that puts you right down on the csm rescue redline; so, really no problem. in good shape, consumablewise. over."
"boy, that's a loaded question, gordy. there's so many things, but i think probably the thing that - when i think about it - that will stick with me most is the same thing that stuck with me - for my last two missions - not so much being there, but it's getting the chance to get home and share what you've seen and what you've done with other people."
"negative. i was asking you if you were satis- fied with it. as far as i can tell, it's satisfactory. and also the primary evap flow is actuated to number 1 at 96 05. over."
we're putting on our saddlebags now - -
"okay. i'm on page 34 now, looking at p52."
"okay, 151 - 1510 enter. okay, jack, pitchover is at 24; 24 is pitchover."
that'll be 190:20:55.
mark. light streak in the lower part of the left eye - young.
"0k_, thank you."
- - so i can bend down.
"bob, the lmp has his ops on. would you believe the plss?"
understand the gold team is got gone.
yes. it seems reasonably warm.
okay.
"apollo 15, this is houston. we'd like to have you retract the mass spectrometer boom for 85 seconds."
"okay, india, 0 - 098:35:04.68; 11:04, plus 0002.6; 002, 114, 340; plus 56997; pdi early, juliett, 101:22:15.00; kilo, 103:21 all zeros. over. 04 00 43 44 _ roger, jim. could we start a pitch attitude down to see the landing site?"
you got it uncovered?
roger.
"okay, they look good."
i did the same thing.
"okay. ""greater than 168 oxidizer; 153, fuel."""
"we got a tough position here too, you know, if you want to try it. just go to off."
"roger. and now, you wanted us to remind you about your helmet and gloves when you take shots of ingenuity this time around. 03 08 17 2_ cdr okay; we'll tell him. 03 08 17 b1 cc and, otherwise, we have nothing more down here. everything's looking in great shape, and have fun on the back side. 03 08 17 _2 cdr okay. thank you, karl. we will.

roger.
yes. how about that?
"well, what did you do with it?"
we're losing our view. we should be coming up on the craler mendeleev. 03 14 24 lh cdr ...
maneuver yourself - -
haven't had any trouble sleeping on this schedule.
"no, we've missed that pleasure."
...
okay.
"hey, fred. john says you can use the dikes on it to get them apart."
"okay. telemetry biomed is right, and scratch recorder."
"roger. stand by, ron."
okay.
very nice.
"want a bite, john?"
"okay, ecs - i think it's on. it's hard to see it."
"pitch 2, mark -"
"falcon, houston. 06 05 53 29 cdr-i_m hello, houston. go ahead."
"you probably have the right tephem in there, don't you? 352 day9 \"
"forward, open and in auto at 4.5. i'll give you a call."
"and, jim- -"
"i don't know. i'd like to get -when you face uphill, your camera faces down."
okay.
"jim, would you give us pcm to hi bit rate. we think maybe we might be able to lock up on your high bit rate now. over."
"okay, fine. the next step now is to anchor that tape, and the way we want you to do that is to cut about a 2-foot length off the roll and then tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide. and you'll wrap those around the canister at right angles, more or less, to the tape that you've got so that it goes across the top and across the bottom; and when it goes across the top and the bottom, put it so that it's outboard of the center hole and try to get it over one of the ridges between the screens, so that it won't block the flow. is that clear? over."
"okay. the steps we've got here are bat 2, off/reset, talkback barber pole; bat l - lmp, on, talkback lmp; bat 2, off/reset, talkback barber pole."
"on that crater that has the definite tan ejecta blanket, if you'll go - directly north - directly north of the center of the crater auwers, a-u-w-e-r-s, until you come out about one of those rilles there in the tacquet area, that's about where it is."
"and, houston, casper. will need a state vector for a - ... to be ready?"
"the thing i'm worried about is if you coarse align, and it doesn't work, then what have you got?"
off to 2 o'clock. it has no rim to it -
mc in auto.
"okay. need to fill that little jewel. fill it! 06 23 05 27 la{p-eva don't spill it, i want to get the top part."
good night.
that just call a noun 20?
okay.
i'll push a little more.
"kind of crunches, doesn't it? man, that's not glass. terrible! man, forget it."
okay.
"yes. 03 10 01 07 c$_p okay. we definitely had it.... didn't see that. 03 10 01 10 l_ yes, it's moving that way right now, stu. you mean the balance indicator - unbalance indicator? 03 10 01 15 cr_ yes. 03 10 01 16 lm_ no, it is not in increase yet. okay, i'm going to normal. 03 10 01 35 cma° judging from pc' i'd say we hadn't had crosso_zer, but the time - -"
"are you talking about right in the area of the landing site? 04 10 2_ 53 _p in the - in the landing site area, but not in the landing site - traverse regions. but that little dark thing looked like a - a possible cone that was out to the - north and to the west. there's a little black dot out there that looks like there may be something that's - %hat is dis- tinctive. and next time i come over, i'll be better prepared to loo_ for it. ob 10 25 19 cc okay. i remember that one, that was in the edge of the plotter, wasn't it?"
mark.
*** hurry if - *** give - they're going to give us the go.
"okay. and step 8 is power down per contingency checklist power 5,"" and i take it that's been revamped considering our situation. okay."
"yes, sounds good."
and there's the average g coming up. twenty- nine seconds.
"no? okay, houston. don't seem to have any side tone or any transmission out of the i/_p's pi_s on a."
"god! there's some - hey, let me get the top of this little instrument box, because the glass is fractured there."
"3000, jim."
and i guess the next order of business - get the rocks all packed.
"oh, no."
did you turn on your stuff?
roger; loud and clear. it's steaming right down the pike.
okay.
sorry about that.
"okay. there we go. plus b56.95, plus 106.34, and a plus 001.49."
i think we're about a half ...
"- - day 6, meal b tonight. man, i tell you, i feel ""oink"" right now."
"not after all this, i don't think. might not even be a one-eva, or a one-eva is about all, i guess."
"yes, if you want. there you go. that ought to do it. okay."
okay. why don't you put this one on the back?
"yes, okay. now, you - you went through the manual prccedures, an_ you get three-quarters signal stzength?"
"okay, that's good. let's move the gnomon, and we won't roll it over on the gnomon. lmp-_fa watch it. watch it. oh, yes. that other side is the one that was up. well, i'm not sure now. it's got so much dust on it. but let's -"
hang on.
"and, 15; houston. if you've got a minute, we've got a couple more comments for you."
okay.
okay.
mark. s-ivb to coi capability.
"17, we'll be having a communications handover to honeysuckle in about a minute and a half."
"say again, ron."
"no, bob. what i'm referring to is on the highlands bordering crisium, but in about all of them you do see a definite radial pattern upslope and downslope. from the center of crisium, but none of the linea- ments like you're talking about like at fra mauro."
"ron, houston here. we've checked the back room and the high-speed charts and that and don't see any glitch on main a at all on our data down here."
he mumbled something very humbly about a thousand guys.
"stand by. that's affirmative, eagle. we'd like you to go ahead and fine align. over."
"yes, i know they do. and i'll tell you where it is; it's down in - -"
"wait, ron, we're going to have an antenna switch coming up. we'll call you back when we get good eolqm. 10 09 47 51 cmip okay."
"okay, my gloves are on. 04 l0 37 06 cdr-i_ all right. my gloves are on. let me check yours. okay, locked and locked. check mine. 04 l0 37 16 lmp-l_ okay, you're locked."
"okay. two, 3 - -"
what the hell spilled those?
roger.
"yes, sir. i_-eva i'll get one out. we can use this one."
"will do, and you're 30 seconds from los, falcon. 07 04 15 04 cdr-i24 roger. see you around the corner."
"ail right, wait just a minute."
"hey, tony. that thing's a piece - _kay, that thing's a piece of cake for aligning it at 270."
okays.we're about to a handover here. i'll check on that and come back to you through hawaii.
"suit fan, delta-p, open. 04 23 ih 17 l_ open."
antares.
... in there.
*** take them straight on. that's all right.
"that's correct and then turn to page 7-15. we're changing - we - looking here a little closer we find that radars are already in good position, so you can delete all procedures on page 7-15, ex- cept ""copy ascent pads, csi pad, and lm dap weight."""
"(laughter) okay. that's gonna t_e some book- keeping; i'll work on that. sure would rather look out the window, hank."
"okay. fdai sc_t.e, 5/5."
what?
"- - nikon was designed for zero gravity, huh?"
"you all set, ken?"
"okay, endeavour; falcon. i guess you're over the hill, because we don't read you now."
did you get it?
"get no reading on 2. okay, coming up on our right is a very subdued crater again. no blocks at all on its rim, and it is about 50 meters in diameter."
"that's right. here, if you're going to get down, i'll read to you."
"..., babe, ..."
it's off.
"okay. cabin gas return, egress."
"al, we see no change at all in the scene. why don't you just give it a little tap? it may be the color wheel is hung up."
"yeah. 06 04 33 39 _mp-eva - - dust. 06 04 33 _0 cdr-eva didn't mea._ to do that. so am z. 06 04 33 43 i_mp-eva okay, tony, the - we - we're coming in an area tlhat is not as - that's not quite as blocky. i'd say maybe - 10 percent of surface is covered with cobbles. still same size. there's one big boulder that i just got a picture of."
"yes, they're all radial, though. imp they are radial, in general. but when you look at them in detail, only portions of them are radial. and a single ray, which you can follow continuously, will bend and then curve back."
"i_ark it: 02:30, 183, 19,000; within 400 feet, and 2 feet a second. ags and pgns are looking great. ()kay, i'll check the targeting. that's a good number. 3-1 , c td t1a l"
"okay, it's orbital science photos coming up here. do you want to use magazine ex still? or should we finish up oscar oscar?"
thank you.
"houston, we're about ready to go to sleep. you got any questions or anything you want to tell us before we shut down the coremsystem?"
"endeavour, houston. we're going to hand you over now. 0_ 03 34 58 g_'p endeavour, roger. 07 03 35 12 ii,lp okay, dave; standing by for 2 minuves."
"america, houston."
yes.

okay. 03 04 38 46 {!._p we're in attitude. 03 0h 38 49 ipp dii you get your optics set up?
"okay. you don't want to watch me fill that pan again, huh?"
okay. and don't forget to look through the optics when you go up in the command module.
"veer good, al. it sounds like you're making a litvle better time going down than up."
look at that part number on the side of the tool.
i was impressed with the smoothness of the - the raised portion.
that's affirmative.
that's affirmative.
"houston, 12."
"yes, that's right. that's what i assumed."
"got a ... that's coming up by your sh - ... that's your shoulder. your ... right? no, ... going the wrong way. that'll get it. okay, and here's the uv magazine. it goes over by charlie. ': '-"
"- - you'll be in rate commknd, and you will have the bell shaking. it'll start to damp a little bit; but every time you hit with an impulse, why, you'll excite the oscillation again."
okay. that's connected and locked. okay. what else we got?
yeah. that water cooling is what does it. why don't you - why don't you -
"let me finish. okay. that's what i thought. bat charlie bat charge/eds2, close; bat baker power entry/postlandzng, closed. on panel 275: cb main b, bat bus b, closed; cb inverter power 2, main b, closed."
charge number 1.
"okay, you verify that the demand regs are in both."
yes. 03 i4 34 59 cdr ... 03 14 35 01 i2_p eight seconds.
"houston, 16. our lm/cm delta-p is 0.2 and the pressure equalization valve is open. our cryo systems are configured."
- - houston. would you give us omni bravo?
okay. it's all working out just fine.
"dave, let's - let's ask you to stand by on that. we'd prefer to complete reading the procedures to you, and then - we'll worry about this light busi- ness. at any rate, you should have inserted the note ""get thrust light on by pushing on panel first. if this doesn't work, rap on panel or cycle the switch and if no light, then delete the test."""
no.
"okay, that's what hank was starting to give me when we bombed out last time."
cuff gage 3.7 to 4.0 at - 02 flag clear.
we 're not.
go.
"14, houston. thrust looks good on s-ivb."
that's affirm.
crank it out about to 40 on the zoom. 0b 19 00 37 i_mp okay.
- - we want number 5 on the hand tool carrier. · 06 03 10 37 cdr-eva 2 and 5 on the hand tool carrier. okay.
"they're sort of localized to one area which is - probably - yes, on the - on the western side of proelus, northwest side."
"okay. you can get those configures when you can. and the next order of business i've got for you is a procedure to verify that main bus b is good. and a little after that, we'll want to read up to you, for your future information, a procedure for transferring lm power to the command module. over. 03 20 39 33 cml° okay. that sounds good. you want to get this plss configuration done first before you give those other procedures, huh?"
"huh? okay. i'll get the down-sun here. 06 23 2_ 25 lmp-eva okay. there's an after, and i'll try to ge_ a locator from up here. and you can almost - -"
"orion, this is houston. we want to try another procedure here to improve our comm. we want you to select secondary power amplifier."
"i don't think it's any deeper. a little softer maybe, maybe a little deeper. why don't i move this down here just a little bit closer, pete?"
"oh, come on."
"okay. and s houston, stand by for a mark on another picture."
"13, houston. did you copy my last about giving us a go for the yaw?"
yes.
egress verified.
"roger, 15."
"yes, i do, vance .... would go in the lm, but i thought maybe we ought to stow it where the cdr stands. how's that?"
"right here, jack, you're going to be able to peek right over the top of bwp."
"okay, joe. it looks like the best we're probably going to do here is to be able to tape it up so we have the contact, and then leave the plss an- tenna down rather than erecting it. i'm afraid if we erect it, why, there's - there's not much room to put tape in there, and it may fall off and then we'd be out of business."
that 's ron.
"okay. at the top of the second column there, the piss 02 and h20 recharge is 129 plus 20; go ahead and do that. and the rest of the page, go ahead and do. 05 08 17 25 lmp-i_ okay."
"excuse me there, charlie."
"okay. yeu're okay to go ... cabin pressure ... 09 o0 01 06 new ao_lio 14, new orleans. request computer read-out. !"
"okay, jack. let's take bmag i off."
good.
"you probe's all right out in here. and if you get in the bottom of it for the - eigher this one, or go out there - especially in the straight line between you and me now, another depression would be good for the neutron flux. you need to be over that way - you're just a - -"
"lm there's the readout. i didn't put the 231 in. you want that also, ed?"
"okay, reset three times."
"okay, vhf a transmitt_q to voice. stay for t1. so, i'll do a 414 - -"
"ken, in reference to your observations of crater king, we got some ideas about those swirls that are northwest of king. and we'd like for you to get a comparison of those with the swirls of ibn yunus. and i wonder if those also have topographic expression? 04 10 33 27 cml° okay. i'm too - i'll have to do that some other time, because today i'm too far south to see those things up by ibn yunus. i can just barely see up to neper."
i guess so.
"okay, we got a good dump. thank you."
"the tan is sort of like a dusted tan in seovs in and around and on the mare. i:d say zhat the basic - if i could pick out a chunk of that 6ray mare from here, t would picx ous a very sveel gray - a dull steel-gray coior_ but if i ,justtook a mass of mare out, i'd have to mix it wish a sub,is - very, very subtle pastel tan,"
"well. hey, bob, we ought to - we ought to find out whether or not we got - whether - what the rock is here, if you've got a little time."
okay.
"roger, jack."
"it was over there in that crater, just uphill from the rover."
very good.
"- - extension handle, and two pairs of tongs. okay, we have two core-tube cap assemblies. we have tether and gnomon. we have a ha_mer_ we have a small scoops, six core tubes, 35-bag dispenser, trenching too]., a 16-millimeter camera, and - _'tay i have that lens brush again, please? 05 11 30 h2 cdr okay. thank you. 05 11 31 17 i2_p ok_y."

okay; and we'll torque at 238:23. _c roger.
roger. we're enjoying fredts music there.
roger.
look at that. look at that thing.
roger.
"here, i can probably do that easier than you can."
okay; you can pull the breakers.
"well, it wasn't in here then."
okay. nighty fine. thank you.
okay.
"okay, dave. if you would, please, turn to page l/4- 14, and we're just going to ask you to copy the pro- cedure onto that page, because it will consist of just a few changes to what's already listed on - on those few pages there."
okay.
"l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. that's the wrong one. okay, now i see what i'm supposed to mark on; okay."
"- - they're saying it might make a 100 to 120 foot crater, too."
work towards the deep core. 06 05 07 22 ln_-eva is this the last time we use this - is this the last time we use this thing?
"yes, sure does."
"good. -.- /2 0h 18 55 29 lmp okay. there's the south quadruplet crater, and _fi-the-_""% t_5_e'x%'?one and the next one and the largest one. you can see - - 3c_ci."
"that sure looks like - looks llke outcrop ... down in the east massif on the lower slopes, if it's here the high albedo is. doesn't it? see it over there?"
huh?
"okay, i was wrong on that. i got it now, 0102.6. and go ahead with the pdi pad. you speak."
yes.
"as a matter of fact, this sure would be a neat place for a space station out here."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, that's a roger."

"houston, how do you get this mesa blanket thing up?"
"okay, we've - -"
"columbia, houston. you were unreadable. say again please."
"okay. okay. that's good. well, that's pretty close - so close."
"okay, old sample bag -"
"okay, would you verify elevation is still at 6.417"
minus 0.12. okay.
"five degrees, 5 minutes, pete."
one moment here.
"we want the southwestern edge, huh?"
"on that ptc startup, there was only one jet that fired, and so we only got half the rate we need, and so the - i guess the only way to recover is to stop the roll and start damping the rates again and wait for our call to start it again - over again. over."
"houston, 15."
roger.
"286.25, all balls, 087.57."
"that food - you eat a lot of that food, and even though you put water in it, it's still - still dry."
i've just been contemplating ... - -
okay. all i do is tidy the blanket.

"we'd like reacq on the high gain urltil we call auto, please."
"put it under the seat, jim, and get bag 2 - -"
yes. i was down there in - cleaning the suit circuit return valve. could you hear it? i was banging the door.
we'd like to get the pan and a double core tube.
"okay, and, gene, remember the driving fairly slow - or fairly well controlled the first 300 meters, and a mark at the end of the antenna."
"okay, dave. we'll get it next time: no problem."
"and we're still in rate 2. cmc, auto. okay, let me realign the old gdc."
"okay, and let's go on the v over h override to high altitude, now, ken."
do you know where this thing ends up?
- - speed to 1/125th.

"that's it, yes. *** swing over so i can lean on the rover when i put the - -"
...
"okay, let's enter on that, okay?"
"and give us a mark rolling, please."
"okay, that may be telling us something, we hope. press on."
"al, i have a couple of questions from ..."
"okay. come on, al, we're wasting time."
"ron, the hot fire checks are complete. you can go into wide dead band, att hold."

diverter valves up in the minimum. (tp_nq)

"and, jack, for your thoughts, we've agreed that you can delete the tracking light. we'd like to get you guys in as soon as possible - 7 minutes now. and we'll delete the tracking light test."
"okay, we got your hoses to the ecs handhold. okay, helmets, visors aligned and locked."
roger. it's apparently raining pretty hard up - -
"no, you wanted a 211."
"that's affirmative, neil. the data that we're receiving looks good and we are receiving sync pulses and a black signal on tv."
dark?
hang on.
"yes, it is. it's - i'm sure i could _ush it in farther, but it's hard for me to bend down further than that. oh 13 36 07 lmp now, you can throw so far. 04 13 36 08 cdt_ you can really throw things a long way up here."
"roger, jim. that's right. and the seventh step - was at 28:35; you're correct, and that brings us to 28:40, which is sps burn test. and at 28:41, verb 66,set csm state vector into lm state vector."
okay. let's see.
and it is level; the bubble's just about in _he center.
"okay, dump to 49 percent."
i'm going to go get the - -

okay.
"no. i don't believe we did that at all, bruce."
"god darn almightyl wasn't that something, babe?"
"okay. i'll - i'll verify that. there was _ome drinking water going - going out at that thne, too, which muddles up the data a little bit, so we're not absolutely certain on that."
roger. we don't have him. stand by.
oh.
how about that? 06 19 03 20 i_mp-i_m okay.

okay. just whenever it's convenient for you.
maybe it knows something that i don't.
"13, say again, please."
rather awkward.
"okay. solar corona pad, 137:33:48."
"orion, houston. go ahead. 04 2_135 41 lmp-lm ... okay. you guys reading us?"
yes.
"hence the name, dave."
i've got the canisters; pins are green.
- - in there. i'm sure of that.
"i'm loading it. 31102, all balls, zero, pro; 63479, 32563, pro. gimbal angles are minus 5.4, plus 1.33. good. set ordeal. verb 83, enter; verb 83, enter. at canary los, we're supposed to do this, and i'm supposed to bring the pyro's up and on, translational control power up and on."
"okay, al. and also, you might t_ r the automatic light control to the outside."
"tony, they were - there wasn't anything in them. you could just look in and you'd just - and they looked clean, and - and - just like somebody drilled out the rock."
"and i'll call out times for you now, too. we go _ to 1/15th of a second."
"roger. what happened there, ken, was we were gonna do a gamma ray extension for a little - out a little ways, and we've - we've canceled that now, so that's not even a requirement anymore. you can use normal jet configuration. 08 22 o0 48 c_ okay_ thank you."
"okay, okay. right now for 49."
"aquarius, houston. request high bit rate, please."
that sounds nice.
right up here. lmp' okay. pga is not biting; lcg's cold. let's leave it cold.
"oh, that's a big bag full. want to put it in mine? lml°-eva it's all right. i can't feel it. you might as well -"
okay.
"and she's flashing, bob."
"_o, he's no_:here yet. 05 21 35 43 i2._ okay, aps. 05 21 35 _4 cdr right. 05 21 35 45 amp engine override logic is closed. ail s&c circuit breakers, closed, except - 05 21 35 52 ,cdp asa and deca power. age qt confident-'t' ml =ay6"
"here i come, ready or not."
how about getting a soil sample under there?
"gee, i hadn't even thought of that ...."
"roger. ken, would you give us one more of those 15-second deploy and back to retract?"
"columbia, houston. you're very weak. say again."
"okay. 12 07 11 06 r roger, apollo 15. if you hear, all units have you in sight, and we are eastbound now."
"yankee clipper, houston. go."
"13, we need omni bravo."
"enter, and that clock's not right."
okay.
"okay. i said you can look right down at the cape area - that's the cape that we know - in florida, and it's little disheartening because the last time i was up here looking back from this angle, they were moving another saturn v for another moon trip out on the pad already. but i guess they're working pretty feverishly out there on b."
"turn around to your right, would be better."
"okay, those are big glass, aren't they?"
"now, we're starting to roll. 0_ 23 h9 17 c_ zt's commanding a roll."
"roger. 04 02 _0 04 lmp okay. cb on 11, ecs: glycol pump auto transfer, open."
yes.
"kind of looks like the earth has _otten kind of angled a little bit, but it's, for as many hours as ..., i think it's been great. you know how to do this? ttow? ... the teznninator."
"okay. circuit breakers, panel - circuit breaker panel 16 rather. ecs, cabin repress to open."
roger.
"okay, and it's steady once you do it, jack, right? lvip-lm right, it's open now. we've been watching it for about a minute, now."
"did you say affirmative, pete?"
"*** grab some right up here, al."
"okay, on step number - or page 2, we should do step 5 and modify step 6 second line to read inverter 2, then inverter 1, to the last line of step 6 cb(ii), eps inverter 2, open."
"yeah. well, let me see the flight plan. thank you ·"
okay. we understand.
"roger, jack."
"and we've got 6 - okay, and we've got 6 bravo, at 385."
"okay. cbs - cb eps sensor unit, ac 1 and ac 2, closed."
"you'd have to see it, pete (laughter). nf'!dent - day 6 page 411"
"okay, jack. i discontinued charge on battery a. you give me the call and i'll turn bus tie ac on."
okay. thank you.
got it.
"okay, ken. there, you are moving north definitely."
okay -
"is he - is he on a simplex, jim?"
"okay, don; and, if you're ready, i'll give you some status reports. o1 22 _7 48 cc stand by just a minute, ken."
you ye got it.
yes.
"yes, i thought that was a real smooth ride. real smooth. okay. let's keep pressing ahead here. slowly but surely. how you doing, ed? 00 o0 43 15 i2_p okay. proceeding through my systems check."
"okay, verify eva cb configuration. and then, r_ david, put on the gloves."
oh.
"sounds like an interesting crater, in any case."
"roger. we confirm that. lm2 by the way, those were the - i guess you know - the sensors that we put on at the cape. and they still seemed to he in good shape when i took them off. i figured i'd let things rest a while, and then i'll put them on again tomorrow. 0i 23 02 55 cc roger. looks like you've got eat period scheduled here for an hour, and then into the presleep checklist."
okay. (colu ia)
"no. okay, i got it now."
okay. that's ... good.
3000 enter.
and what at the end of the i minute?
"okay, we're gonna back this guy up, and we've got - -"
okay.
okay.
"roger. just for your information, everything is looking outstanding and no problems. we're taking a good look at the data here at hawaii, and we'll make a go/no go decision about 60 seconds after acquisition at goldstone. but there's nothing right now to lead us to believe that zero oppor- tunity will be required. _4p okay, bob, understand that. we are prepared, how- ever. spacecraft, other than those master alarms, is looking very good. we got the docking probe extended. the scs reference attitude check is complete."
"- - and i'm about to fall down this little crater hole. oops. wait, it really does get -"
not yet.
"..., right? 07 04 08 33 _ right."
"yes, trying to move ... we've got another 5 minutes to go. anyway, we've used -"
okay.
"let me know when you turn them on. i only need about 5 percent; i don't need much. 00 00 _0 13 cdr okay. coming on. ii )nfid, l"
"okay. i just happened to be throwing a few : switches, and i see our helium tank temperature on quad a is about 95 or so. and the others are quite low. is that because of our attitude there duringthe lm checkout? tape44/9"
eva warning tone may come on momentarily during the ... depress.
"say, joe. does this happen to be anything like the procedures we have on board all ready?"
that's right. wait until the flight planners get a hold of him on his own flight.
"jim, regarding window 5, i have a drawing here; and, when you're docked, you have approximately a 60-degree angle between the z-axes of the two spacecraft. it appears that peering out win- dow 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous radar on top of the lm which would, if you pitched, more or less give you a view of the service module. that is, if you pitched, so - from - and i think that this has been run by quite a few folks here; so, offhand, i can't see where any other window would be as good or per- haps even possible."
roger.
almost like a - a - a black spherule of glass.
yeah. that's great. that's the lower - upper -
"let me tell you, bob. this flag is a beautiful picture. you see that?"
"okay. 05 ?0 53 27 cc okay, odyssey. you're suddenly ahead of the time line."
"go ahead, jim."
"houston, this is al. how do you read?"
although we do have one large rock here that we might as well carry up.
greetings. you're loud and clear.
roger.
"yes. yes, we really got that one messed up."
"okay. about 1 minute to go, shortly."
huh? 06 05 22 28 l_-eva reset the nav.
"oh, i'm enjoying it immensely, tom, as you may have gathered."
"not yet, will be. hold that."
"hey, thanks for the news and i guess those three guys that went up to the moon - you know, they probably cleared that weather up there in houston."
looks good down here.
"okay, here it comes."
"oh, yes; i suggested that we could go to the left, but i guess we don't want to do that."
"- - okay. but the point is we don't trim, we don't need to lock on the - -"
i was wondering whether we were - could possibly f be on dune.
roger. we understand. no problem.
what'd you do? right there. music (freight train)
"roger. i still haven't figured out how to time this thing, i guess."
"no, no. the - the prim water."
"and, ken, we'd like to vent the battery compart - compartment to t volt on your meter. stop it at 1 volt."
"roger. we've been listening to the playback of the dse tape from the alfmed period, and all three of you sound pretty good on that. gene is still clearer than the rest, but all three of you sound real clear and very readable."
he's over there - - l0 04 34 31 r - - he's hit the clouds. i'm on the way down- -
i'm parked there now. it was 358 or whatever it's reading on there.
"okay. hank, i didn't follow that. i thought we were in the ecliptic aux ptc at - for this earlier maneuver. so - say again what happens at 273:15."
roger.
"now, give - why don't you get me - get me a towel here."
okay.
"let's see, i don't know what i have to do here. we've got to do a pressure - pressure integrity check."
"okay, ken, that - that target position you're go- ing to add are vogel, and - and _hat goes all the way up through the cinder cone there. actually, you're changing over at alpetragius - a little jog, and then on up past the cinder cone. and you were originally scheduled to look at bullialdus, and we're going to have to delete that because your track is too far to the north now. _ we're _o- ing to bring your groundtrack from the cinder cone right on up through helmet and gassendi and on u_ to mersenius rille, from d-ii, 12, and 13. 08 04 49 41 c_,_ okay, you want to take one continuous strip."
- - all look good here.
"okay, houston. the 02 flow high and the cabin is pumped up to 5.7."
"okay. that's still going to be mostly retrograde, it looks like. that's how i got in this place to start with."
"yes. here, let me get it. you are hooked on the handle for the plss. can you get down a little bit? okay. see if we can put that ... out. yes. /_ you had hooked the plss harness on the handle."
02 coming off. 10 o1 47 40 i24p locked.
okay. dump valve in auto.
"and, jack, this is houston. we're seeing - looks like your water temperature's getting pretty high. you might want to go to intermediate cooling or slow down or something. looks like you're getting a little warm."
... over here ...
nope. 05 23 56 26 i_p-eva look at that pitch meter.
"yeah, it's 300 meters across. 06 04 33 20 wp-eva and it didn't even show on the map. 06 ct 33 23 cdr-eva i tell you what it did show in. 06 04 33 25 i_mp-eva what?"
okay.
here you go.
roger. it was about 1.6 or something like :hat at shutdown. i'll have to look back at the f!igb_ plan.
"okay, don wrist tether, ring forward."
mine's off.
"that makes the trace a lot better, ken. i imagine it's the third one there."
roger.
"okay, jack. do you want me to proceed by the scs powerdown checklist? i did not copy the scs items you wanted me to power down."
that's right.
there's 2 minutes and it hasn't come in.
okay.
yes.
yeah.
"endeavour, houston. the computer's yours."
"okay. and there at 36, we'll delete the two steps, the one with the vhf that you see, the ""vhf am t/r, receive (panel 9)"" and delete the ""vhf am a, duplex."" and then add ""configure for vhf bistatic test, vhf am t/r, three, to receive (verify). vhf am a, off (verify). vhf am b, duplex (verify)."" and ""vhf range to range. and vhf antenna, right."" and also right, all at the same time, ken, right here around 155:35, we'd like to - didn't leave you much room to write - we'd like to configure for a 2-1/2 degree dead band test. so at 155:35, we'd like ""cmc, free; p20, noun 79, plus 00250,"" and then we'll go back to ""auto."" well, are you still with me, ken, or did i leave you back on the waste stowage vent valve."
"okay, the src is in the cabin, houston."
"hello, falcon. this is houston. just for your own information, the water separator number 1 looks good. but we'll he keeping a further eye on it here. a little later on, gordo's going to read up a pro- cedure that involves the vhf communications check."
"well, this probably is - we can get the other smaller population around it. i'm worried about that one being exotic to the sculptured hills."
"well, you got a lot of daylight on you, still, out there, dick."
"well, as soon as we get over here, we'll stop it with the ttca."
- - reset the caution.
that's affirmative.
you said it was - once you tried it with the - in accel command with the 204. did that have - it said it looked like it was stable but oscillating. what does that mean?
.05g light.
"okay, bob."
"hey, stu. no one ever said anything about the - the p23s. anyone in the back room know how the? .... came out? what kind of an altitude we ended up with?"
"okay, this _s 354. going in bag 354, houston."
really?
"boy, he'd make short work of them."
okay.
... flight plan right in front of you.
maybe i can figure out some way to make it useful yet.
"11, houston. guidance is looking at the noun 40 - 49 stuff. we'll be back with you momentarily. over."
okay. that's in work.
roger.
"okay, falcon. there you are. i've got you now. 07 .03 34 3_ cdr oh, okay."
my ears are going okay.
did you enter on the re - did you enter on it when you got to the attitude?
roger.
big bag is deployed.
yeah. would you throw that back up in there? i threw it the other way.
_3.0. that's correct.
yes.
"okay, now i can't give you the gravimeter reading while i'm working on the rover, so i'll have to time it when i get away from it."
"houston, the ed batteries are reading 37 on both."
"deadband, min."
ail right. let's check all those sps injector valves and close the helium valves - -
roger.
"and, apollo 16; houston."
good show.
"yes, joe, it's coming down. i got just about 45 degrees now and it's coming on down."
"okay, mapping camera - is that the right time? let's see - 49? no, wait just a second on the mapping camera, there. it takes good terminator pictures, too, doesn't it?"
i brushed them and tapped them yesterday.
roger. we see it coming in.
"mark. okay, i'm going to hit normal on the ems. eight - auto."
okay. all the rest of our readup here is in the flight plan.
"that's real - it's really a fascinating crater, the way the dark mare has got in - sort of like a path around the edges, and - and there's a fracture pattern running across it, and it has some very prominent central peaks that are very white. but it has every contrast and color on the moon. tape _9/5 03 d3 08 31 cc roger."
roger.
"yes, there's ... but the only trouble is ..."
i don't think i'm going to be able to see stubby from -
how's the earth?
"z thir_k we don't know the a_nswer vo tha_, jo_ir.. that's why we want to load this software progr_ so we can monitor to see if that glitch is occ_- ring frequently - or it may never occur agai:-_ ',_c really don t know."
what's it look like?
okay.
okay.
i don't see it. it may be in your window. 03 oh 54 09 cdr yeah.
"yes. 05 15 39 22 l_p ail right, come on in."
"houston, apollo 11. one of the larger craters on the back side - i noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and i put the monocular on it. i was able to see - oh, an area maybe a quarter of a mile in diameter. it was really a fresh- looking dark-colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - es- pecially the one that caught my attention. quite remarkable. over."
okay.
well. got it.
no.
"get my top. i can kick a lot of that stuff off my legs. how do i look in back? i_mp-eva terrible. okay, turn."
"good old-fashioned american gray tape doesn't stick to lunar-dust-cover fenders. one more try. i think it'll stay, for an indefinite period of time, right now. not bad for ev gloves."
... minutes. l0 0b 17 32 cdr - - testing his theories with what we been doing.
go.
turn it on?
"okay, the time of transfer to i_mpower was 57 hours, 11 minutes. for your information, we seem to be reasonably fat on power. in fact, we are looking at a procedure that we might recommend to you later on after the burn and so forth of powering up one of the command module main buses via the lm umbilical. this would enable us possibly to charge up the command module batteries. over."
"that's how you want to do that, isn't it, tony?"
okay. 04 08 12 22 _ that's voice backup.
- -biostack in it.
"at 129:20, the same thing, the switch - the delta-p that you read back to us is switch on to talkback gray. and really, i suppose, we should make this a generality - that we don't have to put it in the flight plan every time."
"well, fra_ly, dave, it's your guys option. if you want to lie down and take a little morning snooze while the rest of us keep working down here, that's your option. i'm not sure that we want to - we weren't talking about starting the eva early. i think that was kind of agreed upon before - we start on time, wasn't it?"
"okay. i think you can see the boulder and that's how you can tell, right?"
"okay; no need to trim. we get - zero, plus 7, plus 1."
37
roger. go ahead.
"roger. in other words, you're asking to confirm that it does come full out."
okay. and the sllgles i copied last time were 217 on the shaft and 33 on the trunnion. cnp that's close° just in the sextant again_
"okay. we're hi bit rate. _-_ 04 19 37 11 cc roger. thank you. next step is descent 02 to close. and why don't you do that now, because the step following that is for the ground to monitor the descent 02 tank pressure and the cabin pressure, and we're going to look and see if the leak, which we've seen so far as a drop in the tank pressure, is due to a cabin leak or to a leak in the system itself. copy?"
(laughter) i'm going to get them with the scoop.
"yankee clipper, houston. high gain antenna: pitch, minus 13; yaw, 225."
it's the first good concentration of large rocks that i've seen. very similar to the large rocks that - that 14 saw up at the top of cone.
okay. you can doff your gloves.
"oka,j. we'll plan to do that."
"roger; that's very critical, dave. we copy you loud and clear. we need a bag number for that."
i take it you're going to pick up the - the reports - postsleep reports later. is that correct? from ron?
that's affirmative.
"okay. frame 26 for 4 seconds - i mean for four frames. 01 22 08 15 c$_ okay. that one cell i spoke of that was about three-quarters of an inch in diameter now is about an inch long and maybe three-quarters of an inch wide. each - ail of the cells seem to be bigger, in general. they're bigger this time. there is two small ones at about an eighth of an inch and - and along one side. the other one is a half-inch, a half-inch - oh, a quarter of an inch, a half- inch, and then a circular when you get around the outs - out - annulus of the cup. then you start getting circular sides instead of straight sides. ail of the flow comes from the little center spot and flows outward from the center toward the out- side of the cells."
"az.,this is houston. i think it would look a lot - lot better if you could bring it over closer towards the _. 04 18 42 15 _ _t it right here in front of us, al."
descent propellant iso valve - iso - isol valve - descent propellant isol valve.
we didn't put it in my safe place.
"under the - under - yes, i put it under - - --_"
yeah.
roger. stand by.
"no, no."
"okay, geno, west side of steno there."
do you have - -
copy that.
you say that sure has been planned for me?
"man, if this don't get you back to one g, nothing will."
let me reset the valve.
"couldn't be better, al. how's it going?"
"gordy, the country gene's pointing out is souvh of the orbis that we've been following for several days: and ron_ even more than gene and i, ,%nd it's some of the shriking country of the far side of the moon that human beings don't very often have a chance to see, but a trend's been started in the last few years_ and i suspect it will continue. _ roger, jack."
let's see. the 02 flow is high.
"okay, hatch is going in."
"you're right, aquarius. let's delete the rcs checkout. and a dps looks go."
roger.
huh?
okay.
"good readback, and here's the p32 csi pad: 176:44:33.91; 178:37 all zeros; 057.1, plus all zeros; 0404.6, 0517.0; plus 057.1, plus all zeros, plus 001.3. over. 07 06 00 17 l_-_,_ okay, jim, i need the noun 11 csi t. seconds snd everything after eelta-vy. lg"
"okay, now, ken, here's - it - this gets kind of messy through here so you might try to write small. and the only thing we're trying to do is, of course, get into p40 and take the auto maneuver, set up for the scs burn, get back into track attitude, and then back to scs. and the way we'll do that is we'll take the first line, ""cycle cmc mode, free, auto,"" and delete it."
"well, you'll never believe it, but after we had the leakage on the morning of the 26th, somebody sat down and wrote up a special procedure, just in case."
"okay, it's flying pretty good."
"and i think i see, on the surface here, linea- ments that are trending about - northwest-southeast, jim. do you get that feeling? morton's [?] little lineaments. look - look as we go across here and if you think about them, if you look down there."
"wait, wait, wait, wait."
"orion, this is houston. for your information, your total eva time was 20 hours 14 minutes and 55 seconds. over."
i'm kind of worried about this camera back here. it might come banging down.
- - white crater is a - or even right like you're headed now and then veer off to the right.
thank you.
"hatch is closed, barely."
yeah.
"... yet, it takes a long time."
off with your tone.
i'll give them to you.
yes. r_ 06 02 21 17 cdr-eva okay.
that fender is really going to be a nuisance.
"okay, the seal is clear, like i promised i'd make it, coming over the top. bob, the seal is clear."
"that's an edge of a crater, i guess."
"and the more i look at this material, the more i see it has an awful lot of these little flow pockets in it. there are a lot of collapse features like - it looks - i would say a whole large area may have collapsed. you see relatively large numbers of small craters and a generally undulating pattern that covers this entire area. and we're almost up to mendeleev now, and the material looks a little smoother. it looks like i've got some smooth material that's kind of filled in with a little rougher material. and it looks like, as i look down at it, that - what is in fact smooth just doesn't have as many of those little craters in it. but that's not really the case. the dark stuff has more craggly kind of craters and more linear furrows."
okay. i'm asking him.
"okay, jim, the helium is holding right up there. it's 2400 and that was where it was before we started getting those rcs lights. the pressure never has gone above about 205, 210 maybe."
did you turn the descent water off?
"yeah, maybe. i don't know."
roger. we're pressing.
okay. e_$ of tape apollo 16 air-to-ground voice transcription
the engine override is off ... - -
...
"get those tv cables cut. now, wait a minute; leave it right on there for a second. come on over and put the thing in my back and let's mount our cameras and then etb. is that all right?"
roger.
yes. 06 01 01 22 i/_p-eva - - the north rim.
"okay; copy add at 12:15 ""waste stowage vent valve, close."""
"i think we've been averaging 11 or - 11 kilometers, houston."
"go ahead, joe i was just going to say, it's 3 o'clock in the morning back there."
good.
"and just for your information, your buddies on the surface are out walking around the rover right now on television."
stand by.
"okay. first statement is a statement: ""verify ags in operate for 5 minutes."" then we go to ""ags address 400 plus 5, then 400 plus zero. a_itlrde control: pitch and roll to pulse; yaw, mode control. maneuver using ttca pitch and roll."" the computer is controlling yaw, but you can over- ride with aca. you with me? over."
see 'that? off to the north?
"you notice when we're in the light mantle looking at the scarp, at this angle, it loses some of its high albedo?"
very weak?
"okay, charlie, say when."
"columbia, columbia, this is houston. over."
all right.
okay.
i feel like i'm pulling 50.
"okay. suit gas diverter, egress."
that 's it.
"okay, you're going about 110 right now."
okay. the levas are both on.
yes.
"and, gene, it'll be about 7 minutes until the evasive burn; 5 plus 03."
cove is.
"there you go. that's a boy. you got a book over here, too, you know."
"right. over to the right on the edge of plum there, looks like there might be rock with some phenocryst in it. if you're over that way, you might look around and see if you see something like that. it may have just been dust on it."
"okay. and, also, we'd like you to read out t ephem for us. that's verb 5 noun i 1706 enter."
"..., houston. and the computer likes it."
okay - -
"abort system propellant, rcs command; verify."
that's verified.
it seems to have died slowly there.
"have at it, john."
pip pin didn't work.
"well, helium press, rcs."
"don't worry about it, charlie. 06 03 27 39 i24p-eva well, i was gonna put it in a sack so they'll make sure - all that hammering, i don't want them to lose it. yeah."
okay. stand by.
about 10 minutes to sep - i mean to jett. ten minutes to jettison.
roger. go for pdi.

an outside reading? what do you mean?
"it was just out there north of grimaldi. just north of grimaldi. you might see if you got any- thing on your seismometers, although a small impact probably would give a fair amount of visible light."
i don't see the lec out there. where is it; down on the surface?
"and, you know, the terrain, looking from the east here - the - is just a general rise to the east. it looks like, oh, 2 - 2 or 3 percent. notice that, dave?"

"15, this is houston. if you see something signif- icantly different from the point source, we'd like a real-time voice description of it, as well as dse recorded."
"gene, i'm going to go up and look at this one rock. why don't you set up and sample any one of these other big ones. they're all the same. like the one near the rover. and i'll go up and try to get this big one down there."
right out that way; right out that way.
"11, houston. the radios are still in good shape, and we are still waiting for your rates to decay. we've got 0.03 degrees per second _n pitch now."

"okay, that's baja down there."
yes. it looks like it's almost all the way in.
okay now -
"oh, snowing. no - no, not quite. the windows are in pretty bad shape, and i guess the service module - we'll be trying to shoot out of the lm window, because every window in the command module is just covered with water droplets. it's going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those cleared off."
you're supposed to get that.
06:05 -
you even hit it with the front end and some of them pop off. they're flying all over the place.
that's affirmative - -
"aquarius, houston. negative on the p51. we want to stay just like we are, but we'd like to be able to correlate what you're doing with some simulator work we're going to crank up. and so if you can give us information as to what stars you can see out the window, we can make that correlation."
roger. we'll suggest that.
"roger; copy. and, jim, checkpoint 2 is out at 4.3 clicks - -"
"okay, can you give me a bearing and range at victory?"
okay.
"okay. you can give me scb-5 then, and -"
roger. stand by 1.
roger. we're ready.
"why? there you go, look at that; there's the old star we've been missing."
"okay. we copy all of those updates. the only one i don't understand is on 11-1, on the pgns activa- tion, ... we crossed out the pro and added an lgc/ dsky closed and right before that it says lgc/dsky closed."
"(laughter) i don't know what we would do without you, joe."

"well, i was down to 0.4, now it's up to about 0.5, 0.4 and a half. ail we need is less than 0.8. well, i hadn't been timing it. i guess it's about 30 seconds, though."
"yes, frc_athe copulating craters. off to your right, you'll see mendeleev, the big huge - - 03 10 09 28 iatp yes. let's see. turn around and look back along the track now, 180."
"- - know if i want to take you down there or not. yes, jack, hold on ... you down there. lmm-eva horatio has quite a different appearance than camelot. it is - and that's the main one - the rims - the blocks do not get to the rim."
"yeah. i - i kind of feel like if we're ever going to be able to sort this out, north ray's probably the place. personally, to be able to get down 200 meters is something we probably ought to do to - to see just how complicated this thing really is."
-- you get less and less each swath.
*** fall out.
"jack, we lost all of that due to the antenna switch. say again."
okay.
and we're going to turn our tv monitor off now for a short bit while we have some other work to do. apollo 11 signing off.
"no, let's get up per the flight plan. we're very much aware of - of that; we've just been doing some restowage and a few other things around here. but let's get up per the flight plan and fine."

"okay. o1 03 29 52 imp okay, tony. go ahead."
(laughter) looks like there is in some parts.
you're not all the way in darkness yet anyhow.
"no, we will not turn the sep on, jack. you might cover it with a blanket as well as you can. and how about a temperature reading before you leave, when you do that?"
"i knew they wanted that, gordy, and that's why i only gave you one."
okay. .f
and we have a purge valve.
"okay, orion, you better turn the power amp back on, so we can hear you a little better."

"i'll check the ed batteries one more time. and they're still 37 volts, jim."
"i assume that - all i wanted to know is that first time, 07 20, that's the time of steam tressure peg. right?"
click and lock. get your flaps back here.
roger. we'll work it out.
"gordo, we're just finishing chow and doing a little cleaning up, and i'm doublechecking the stowage and so forth. but we do have a minute. is there by any chance any late news? anything going on today that might be of interest?"
"okay. i see the battery light flickering now. t_p,' 78/2 ]'age 579"
"the origin of that question was there was some question whether the panel may not have come off entirely and, underneath that, is some of the mylar stuff."
okay.

"you're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. neil, jan had said about yes- terday's activities, ""the evening was unbelievably perfect. it is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the manned spacecraft center, the american public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration."" she was then asked if she considered the moon landing the greatest moment in her life. she said ""no, that was the day we were married."" and mike, pat said simply, ""it was fantastically marvelous."" buzz, joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the eva on the moon. she said, ""it was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. after the moon touchdown, i wept because i was so happy."" but she added, ""the best part of the mission will be the splashdown."""
"okay. and, houston, aquarius. you might know when you've had enough ranging so we can get the power amp back off again."
"yes. l_-eva right now. v_en i say fragments, i'm talking about rocks that are - are greater than a centimeter in grain size."
this geologist turned engineer for about an hour.

"okay, now, this says that - this is after the pro on gimbal test, and we're saying that if we - you get one of these_litches, use the rhc to stop the rates. would there be any objecti0n to just switching to scs while we do the rest of this, and that's my question. now i'll read on. it's ""verb 23 noun 20 enter enter,"" and i have a ques- tion there, is that - i got the impression from what we were saying in our previous discussion that this wasn't restricted just to the middle gimbal; it's a possibility for - for the others. and then a ""verb 40 enter,"" which will release the platform. verb 62 will take us back. it's not - it's not clear to me, once we've put in noun 20 as zero, that verb 62 is a useful number. it seems to me that i must have skipped something here."
"okay, and on the - right under that on the ""pro verb 37 06 enter,"" we'd like to delete both of those lines."
"orion, ho,,t do you read casper :_-_vhf alfa? ot 10 02 04 cdr man, you're just super on vhf alfa. how me?"

"okay. we think we've got a pretty good handle on what the problem was - and that was, that the - the lm communications gear, we think, was jumping on the voice subcarrier, rather than the main carrier. and the symptoms that we had point to that. what would happen is, when i would try to transmit, then it would lose lock as soon as i put modulation on the voice subcarrier. during the checks today, we're going to try to verify that the system is indeed working okay. and we can do it without any changes in the onboard pro- cedures by - purely by procedures that will be handled at the ground site and here at mission control. and so that's what we're planning to do. we really don't - the problem that happened has been seen before, evidently; and it's not that unusual. we really don't think there's anything wrong with the onboard equipment. over."

"yeah, but it - it's not working. yet this works like a - hank, i don't really know what's going on with our antenna. it's - i get you the best signal strength by going to manual and narrow. and every time we switch to either auto or reacq, why, it seems to break - break some kind of a beam switch, lock, or something. and we tried going to manual and wide and then working it through reacq and then bringing it down and things. that doesn't help any. would there be any future in trying secondary electronics, the servos? think it's in the antenna electronics itself. which one you going to fix?"
"okay. we copy that, john."
what would you folks think about my going to whatever attitude i'm going to do ptc in tonight and get it all damped and ready to set up?

are we going to use your -
"that's right, buzz; and the last item here, _. do request that we do a p52, even though we're not doing midcourse correction; and we suggest you get to that after the waste-water c_umpha _ been complete. we also have a state vector ui- date for you, if you can give us po0 ard accept. over."
we'll leave the kit in here; i'll take it over there and then after we get our suit off ...
"go ahead. _mp roger. i just was th_n_ing while i was waiting here that the cleanliness of these two spacecraft is certainly a tribute to the - all the people at gx,_-,,-nand downey and at the cape, who worked so hard to put them that way."
yeah.
"that's right. i heard what you said, but you're turning our voice around."
"right. i sure do agree with you, john."
have you got master arm that goes at 17
and i'il nut this one down here.
"and, jack, you're going to be on the biomed tonight? whose side are you on? of course, i am. bob, i'm hooking up right now. i sort of rested my - my own personal sensors and i'm putting the mechanical ones on - electrical ones, i guess."
okay.
"oh, looky at that."
"well, i'll try to take this camera ... how will that be?"
roger. understand.
"... okay, gang, ... - - time skip"

"12, houston. go ahead. we concur with you on your setting for fra mauro. 06 21 44 30 cml3 okay. i'll make it 1/125th on the next pass. time skip"
"there's 190 on this roll. that's one-third of the way, right?"
"that's because everything is so much bigger; the craters are so much bigger - than anything you've ever seen, and i think that's why."
can you get around all right?
negative. we would like ail the drive enables to pwm 1.
"i might suspect as much. oh, don't worry about that. 06 23 45 57 l_p-eva okay. let's pour the old samples - -"
they will be. but we don't have the lights turnea up; you won't be able to see them.
"yes. my ears are popping to beat the band - i changed my mind, i'll let it go down slowly."
okay. 04 12 16 06 lmp/cdr propellant temp/press monitor ... ascent then descent.
"okay, aquarius; ttouston. that attitude looks pretty good. itow's jack getting along?"
very good.
okay. ·
got that. 05 10 45 21 imp connect 02 hoses.
*** that will survive going back now. it's a frothy - glass agglutinate is going to be in bag 481.
"well, i guess - i guess our first indication was lack of a good integrity check. as a matter of fact, we couldn't get much more than about a pound in the suit. and the first - in thinking it over, we - we thought the only thing it could be would be those connectors, because that was the on - only semiopen port, even though it shouldn't - shouldn't be leaking. and, everybody checked their helmet and gloves and they appeared to be locked, so we broke open the helmet and gloves and jim reached in through my zipper and pulled out the lcg connector and stuck in the plug. and -- then we rezipped, or i did. jim rezipped me. and we tried another integrity check, and it _:_ worked okay. i guess beyond that - i don't have any explanation for it, other than the only pos- sibility is that the lcg connector was leaking, or that somebody's glove or helmet was leaking, be- cause the suits have been, as you know, very tight all the way through."
and i'm now ... all the way out.
"must be the main regs cutting in. (laughter) that's right, you can't see master alarms, can you?"
"okay, ronald. the computer is yours and you can turn the lunar sounder radar switch off. leave the recorder switch on."
okay. here we go. okay. the runt - the fright - the front wheels turn. i can't see the rear ones.
"you can pass the word to captain green, back there on the ti to clear the flight decks."
"no, they're - gene was working pretty hard putting tb-t drill in the ground, and it was some pretty difficult work. and they - they each fell a _ j couple of times, so they were really pretty busy."
"oop .... -- 06 05 12 09 i24p-lm yes, that's what i thought. watch the lid _- doesn't come open."
"35 - 35, oxidizer; and 20, fuel. right where it was when she cut off."
yeah. i'm fine. i just - -
"i was just going to say, it would be interesting to hear what they find out."
"and when you get it in there, try to tap it; maybe it will come out - -"
"okay. jack, you can be getting on. you won't need a bomb, and i guess you won't need the lmp camera unless you want it. we'll be deploying the bomb at steno."
"oh, just take them straight on. that's all right."
"endeavour, houston. do you have the falcon on your monitor?"
- -then you're going to take 500 millimeters when you get back to the rover while i do a radial sample.
"apollo 16, houston. i have your final entry pad."
"go ahead, houston."
okay.
roger. thank you. (columbia)
"hey, ken. r0n's asking what you were wearing last night when you got cold."
verify. i have those down here.
"i think you're right. i think that's it. let me get over here, and then i'll head a little bit to the south. l_-eva yes, we're a little more west, i think, than we intended to be."
"okay, that's going to vent. okay, you're at vent."
good.
"and, houston, mode set was on time."
"roger. okay. flight plan updates for the coming rev and -there's several of them here. and just to keep you feeling a little bit more optimistic, on the following revs, there are very few updates. okay. at 212:40, we want to delete map camera image motion, increase. at 2 - -"
okay. just a second.
"roger. but you know where it is, so you'll find it when you get there."
"maybe we all ought to slide down a little, and then - and then ken can - -"
yes. okay. i'm going to - -

... high bit rate.
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read?"
yes. that's right.
"bob, we are at vip."
okay. stand by 1.

roger.
that's what i'm going to do.
"yes, that's what i say. i think b is that deep crater right directly ahead of us, ed. c5 12 32 05 _p nc, i disagree. i think - see that crater right over there we came by? to the south, the big cne?"
"fantastic. that's the first foot on the lunar surface; it's super, tony. okay, tony, we're making little footprints here about 1/2-inch deep, not kicking up really very much. we're going to have to pull that mesa up, john; that's too low."
()kay.
copy that.
"okay, thank you. oh 22 35 27 cdr-eva shazam!"
"roger, ron. i've got a - you can go back to block, ron. and on that same page with the j-3, i've got the t-horizon and tca."
okay. i'm going to walk away with this one.
okay. on panel 5: ...
"wait a minute, wait."
"okay. 03 15 h0 30 ifc i k_new lunch was a little short today. 03 15 ho 3h cdp, well, they knew we were going to be busy. 03 15 ho 37 ti_zi yes. yes, we didn'z (cough) - -"
okay. cut-off at _2.
...... again.
there's a recent hit.
"houston - houston, i'm sure you've seen it. we're reading below the green band oxidizer pressure, about 163."
"well, things just as nominal as they could be. we had good tpi and then midco'_rses of around 1.9 and 1.1 feet per second, dblta-v total. give you the exact numbers if you want them, but every- thing's just about nominal. 05 23 02 40 ij.°fi and you're locked up on the steerable, housvcn."
"roger, jim. and we're reading you 5 by, babe, when - when that thing's connected. sounds like that 's the problem."
"well, i almost got it. the old - oh, wait a minute. you - what page did you give me?"
"yes, i wouldn't be surprised - -"
whoo! i got to go around this thing.
"hello, apollo 11. houston. goldstone says it - tv looks really great, five-by; we don't - the agc looks like it's working fine. the f:22 is good; we have no real white spots. they're real pleased with it. over. (goss net 1) tape 7/6"
"which mag do you suggest for me, joe?"
"hey, bob, it looks like we might make - getting to sleep on time tonight, and - well, we will make it. and i think it goes without saying, we def- initely want to get up on time tomorrow."
"okay, 280 is over here."
"yes, damn cold."
how's that? pretty good attitude?
very good.
"oh, you won't believe it."
"okay, gordy, i - i'm looking around, but i can't figure out what that masteralarm is. i didn't see any 02 high flow and i didn't see any lights, and we did get it down in the leb."
that's affirmative.
"okay, houston; this is the challenger. you were loud and clear, loud and clear. no different from the transmissions in voice, and counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. how do you read? over."
"well, they , they - -"
"this is - partially sacked. there we go. you got it. ': 06 02 15 33 cdr-eva okay, that - get the after. got it. 408, houston, is the bag number."
it's probably done.
"yeah. they're not as large, and i hadn't seen those before just now. they're right in the corner of the window, as usual. it's going to take a little work to find them."
yes.
"aquarius, houston. go ahead."
he's not going to be this 1°w . 2-8 day 5
okay. our waste off.
min; low.
okay.
"challenger, houston. one update for the postsleep procedure. i understand you brought in the lmp's camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the jett bag before the final jettison here, and by the way, you're stay for the final jettison."
"aquarius, houston. over."
"but the bulk of australia is very clear, all the south and the north. it's just that one line of - of clouds that crosses the center section."
go to ...
"you got your little - hey, where are mine? where's that other one? oh, - okay, that's all i wanted to know."
it's on.
got your eye on me?
"yes, it's barber pole."
damn! sort of lost him.
"*** get out. *** put this away. wait a minute. get up, out - all the way."
i got the ordeal up.
"now, some of the - a few of the inclusions are - well, they're all subrounded to rounded, and a few - and a few of them are very light colored. i'm going to try -"
cetting in practice.
"you want to start from here, or do you want to turn- okay."
"using these values, huh?"
"okay, dave_ you ready to press on with that glycol pump check?"
"that's right, jim. sorry, i should have used that terminology."
okay. the next one is at 141:50.
"okay. it's in. okay, 42 - 41 lpd, 3000 feet on profile."
i was dumbhead for letting that son of a bitch overspeed_ wasn't i?
"okay, i've got my hands off it. it's standing there."
urn.
"no, the boom out."
"*** master a_4, on, 30 seconds *** hit us again. houston, the master arm is on, and the a and b lights are on."
"okay; houston, 15. if you want to orient yourself on the tv there, bob, we just came over macrobius-a, and the small crater that you just saw - we just went by, is romer-j. we're coming up on - on romer-k here in a moment, which means that very shortly, we'll be coming up over the littrow rille - rima littrow."
"well, where does it fall, joe, and what does it concern."
roger. and was that an empty one?
"houston, tranquility. did you all come up with (tranq) aay other solution that we might try to the mission timer problem? over."
"okay, stand by."
"houston, apollo 11. do you need some help keep- ing omni's locked on us?"
"okay, joe. the crater is very uniform. it has debris on the order of - oh, a foot or so - almost throughout. no accumulation of talus at the bot- tom, and it's got fines covering everything, noth- ing really sharply exposed. and most of the fragments are subangular and it looks like non- vesicular, although i do see one high vesicular one right in the bottom. and it's about 60 meters across and maybe - oh, 10 meters deep, smooth sides, and a very slightly raised rim. 06 22 19 35 imp-eva dave, let me tut - -"
... what are we gonna do with our suits now? i hate to waste all the effort to wad them up. how about -
"okay. are we going to use the same techniques that we normally do for lm activation? in other words, i try to maintain an attitude, smd give him some angles and then - are you going to give him the angles? then he does the 52."
roger.
"roger. go ahead, il. over. (goss net 1) tape 7/4"
"falcon, houston. do you have an estimate of your landing site?"
"okay. church services around the world today are mentioning apollo ll in their prayers. presi- dent nixon's worship service at the white house is also dedicated to the mission, and our fellow astronaut, frank borman, is still in there pitch- ing and will read the passage from genesis which was read on apollo 8 last christmas. the cabinet and members of congress, with emphasi_ on the senate and house space committees, ha_e been in- vited, along with a number of other guests. buzz, your son, andy, got a tour of msc yesterday. your uncle bob moon accompanied him on the visit which included the lrl. among the - -"
you know? l_ 06 05 14 09 lmp-lm it's number 6.
you want a verb 58?
"yes, i do. actually we - pete's pads went in a little bit further than did neil's; i'd say most of the pads are in about an inch and a half to two, and it sort of looked like we were moving slightly forward, and that pretty well killed off our left-right velocity when we touched down. the right-hand footpad seems to have bounced; that'd be the plus y, the right-hand-side one; the others don't seem to have. so it must have - maybe hit there first, and rocked back and forth or something."
"gene, i'm going to go up and look at this one rock. why don't you set up and sample any one of these other big ones. they're all the same. like the one near the rover. and i'll go up and try to get this big one down there."
okay. copy that. you guys may be getting just a little far north.
i guess that's some other - -
okay. we copy that. 06 05 26 49 l_-eva csvc is in the rock box. racking it in there.
"also, we've tracked you a while now a_udmidcourse 5 looks like a whopping 0.3 of a foot per second at the present time."
okay.
"yes, i - want to - want to - come in at a -"
"(laughter) well, put it on there, i guess. yes. close up a hole there next to the ... okay, let's see, i guess we can button that back up."
"let me - let me get my hand out of here, that's what's holding me up; now you can pull it in."
"yeah, i think so. i'll check again."
"0 - okay. dump the ops, ken, up to - to get the cabin up to 5.6 and then leave it in bleed flow."
"well, i think the flight plan will probably ke_,p me warmed up, too."
"no, we're not there. we're not too far from salyut. i did find that, - i think."
"okay, then, gene; no problem."
freddie baker's [?] simulator was never like this one.
"okay, bob, i'm going saveral meters around to the east and towards the south to get this pan."
"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 - -"
"okay, vance, go ahead. 06 05 5b 49 cc okay. these are going to all refer to your visual sighting targets, and so the first one -_ is v-lb, tsiolkovsky. you don't need to pull out the book, just - but i'll reference them to the pages in the book. first question - or the first c_mment is, would you mark the area on - in your book - c_ the central peak where you saw layering, and when you get back, we can look at it."
"suit t_p, cold."
"yeah, we understand completely. 04 01 09 i6 _ jim, your up-lin k voice is just beautiful in every antenna we got. over."
"go ahead, jim."
"okay, and the shutdown, if it's - if it's ... control - tli - if you overburn shutdown, you ..."
"roger, dave."
...
rigel. okay. what have we got. 03 13 h6 10 cmp okay. you want a plus 288.30.
we r;opythose in the src.
i'm going to take a tour around that boulder and get a case on it.
"roger. i understand that. that's the only problem, though. is that correct? it won't affect the other batteries?"
(laughter) you mean you didn't enjoy it?
"no medication yet, but i'm considering a couple of aspirin. i'll let you know if i take them."
ignition.
"oh, i see what you're saying. yes. no, you - you had to have some sort of a solid crusv and then the impacts hit the solid crust and broke through the crust and got down into the liquid mantle."
"okay. gee, it's nice to sit down, isn't it?"
"43:40. thank you, gordo."
"yes, still with you. got it."
"well, there goes the monitor. watch out fdr the trim."
pressure is 90 on the gage.
"gordy, you want delta 1, 2, 3, and 4, and charlie 3 and 4 for damping. and you want bravo 2 and delta 2 for spinup, as the flight plan says?"
"(laughter) it looks like it is gonna come apart, though, to me."
okay. understand.
you have an ergometer up here.
"understand the first, vance, and no one has on any biomed - -"
yes.
mine's off.
that's affirmative.
"okay. 214:17, stop to start and laser altimeter, on. go."
"... too, pete."
- - our block population in - here now on the south rim of coehise and it's - and up ahead of us *** it's up to 5 percent. and it's - all looks like subfloor - light to tan subfloor gabbro - or tan- gray. *** much blue-gray; *** on here.
"oh, i see one."
"if you get it hooked on_ you can pull the tether off my hand there, charlie. 09 03 12 53 c_fp-eva no, sir. okay, how we doing on umbilical now? how we doing on umbilical? you got most of it ::nside? okay. go ahead."
"let me show you something. how easy it is in 1/6 gravity. now, lend me your flashlight."
okay. what? let's put the - let's put the soil in there with the ...
okay; enough said. i guess what we don't need right (chuckle) right now is a nice female voice.
"okay. rcs alfa, 85 percent; bravo, 85; descent 02 number l, 71.5; number 2, 68.4; ascent 02 num- f ber 1, 99; number 2, 99; descent water, number 1, 42.3; number 2 is 40.2; ascent water, number l, 100 percent; number 2, 100 percent; and descent amp-hours are 1157; ascent amp-hours, 572. over. 05 18 20 35 lmp-i_ roger. i copied all that."

go ahead.

wouldn't be at all surprised.
is - is our shutdown.
good readback. let's press on with the checklist.
"no, why?"
"al, how do you read now?"
"good point. 06 0t 14 12 cdr-eva roger. well, i'll tell you what. if we do a rake sample in the wall, would probably be our best bet."
"well, you've got to, also got to be careful with this tool carrier, houston. did you want to put the gnomon in, pete?"
"houston, antares."
"just a second, jack."
do you have the speed amps?
but i want to go 10 degrees off our takeoff angle; and i think i'm headed out about that way now.
"15, houston. over."
"oh, yeah. we took pictures of it."
"jack, was that activation 1, step 3 only, or all of activation 17"
"hey, geno, the guys are looking at that buddy slss bag and suggested you all make sure that you're going to have room to do the equipment jettison and get the hatch open and all that. they had planned on stowing it the next day."
... get our ... are off.
"yes, i got two stars, circling back, nunki and antares ... back up again."
roger.
"is jack in the sack, or is he with you? 04 ih oi ........................... _ _-_ _l_ t+,_ of humorous; fred's aieeping place now is in the tunnel, upside down w_th his head resting on the ascent engine. jack is on the floor of the lm, with a restraint ... _rrapped around his arm to keep him down there."
- - suit isol valve. 05 06 08 58 cdr-i_m god d_n!
"we - our update puts you to - the delta-h to 35 kilometers, mike. over."
"okay, jim. and min diverter on your plss, please."
"for lunch, scratch the vanilla pudding in a can; the white bread, 1; and the peanut butter pa- rentheses wp; and add a chocolate bar and coffee."
okay. we'll be able to get better comm.
"circuit breakers (clears throat) - no, wait a minute; i'm right at the place where i got to stop, right now. ail right, no direct ullage breakers yet. stop right there. pick it up again after dick gordon gets done his namby-pamby - -"
you got about 65 percent.
74 - -
roger.
didn't get it; p63.
"turn some more, i can almost reach it - another."
"okay, jack. the second line under ""imu powerup"" says ""fdai power to both,"" and we're going to make that a ""1."" the reason we're doing that is, again, to conserve power. there's no reason to drive the second fdai before we get that information to put on it."
we can hear you loud and clear. we're just looking at rocks right now.
"oh, i can even see stars now with the reticle turned on. is it - guess what i got? antares!"
what?
"how about friday evening, jack?"
"delta-vs compare pretty close, as matter of fact."
"bob, 17. how do you read?"
"let's see, 018 degrees for .7, so right over the next rise, we should see homeplate."
"okay, dave, and just plug it on to your camera at your convenience. you'll want to change the ex- posure time to i over 125, and you might call out the filter position."
"that's affirmed, jim. how do you read now?"
"oh, about a minute from now."
"no. before you do that, come here a second, would you, please?"
"i mean, does it - -"
"... looked at that earlier and you said you couldn't do it. 06 22 35 17 _mp ... no, no ... between fra mauro and descartes."
"aquarius, ttouston."
"oh, yes, particularly, you know, if there is a little time. i - i could transfer the bags up and just leave them on the porch, wait for you to get up there, and you pass them, then i could grab them with that lec hook."
"secs logic, two, off?"
okay; and i'm drawing a couple of little pictures of it to show you when i get back.
roger.
_laughter)
"if you're talking to me, it's about 0 - 104.7 and then 0."
"morning, houston. this is falcon."
"oh, yeah. am i supposed to put that in right now?"
... in. check the aps.
"okay. john is marking on out there, and go ahead. i'll copy."
"... put the uv thing in there, charlie. time skip"
"... move over. man, it's rough to find a level soot to put anything. okay. number 2 is comin_ gut."
"is the f-stop satisfactory, houston?"
... splattered it all over the ...
okay. we think you guys are getting to the point we ought to swing a little bit west to make that 234/2.1.
"every once in a while - every once in a while, she breaks through a soft spot."
okay.
"okay, houston. going to 3."
"and the next change, jack, is panel 275. scratch the step ""cb main b, bat b, close - bat bus b, cmos e."""
"tranquility base, this is houston. over."
"and, char!ie, we'd like the lcru on internal."
supposed to do that.
"they're in, tony, and can't move it."
"okay. okay, at 1 minute, john, we go to ags mode control to auto -"
"that's about where they were, ken. i'ts about time to start your v49 maneuver."
okay.
"okay, you want me to get a - you want to break that and i'll go get this sample, gene."
"well, i'll have to -"
okay. i'm down to 37.
"well, wait a minute - maybe not."
okay. we copy. 389.
"hello, apollo 11. houston. over."
"okay, there's the minute now."
"it's out. it is, now."
"and, houston, tranquility. have you had enough (tranq) tv for today?"
"we think we know where the platform is, jim. the tracking looks real good from the last burn. we feel just a p52 will be required."
"ckay, gordie. we've got you on that."
that's a good idea.
"it's still - still a problem in scaling when you look at something like that, until you're sure that you have the right feel for it. but i think it's pretty obvious, and i think picking it up tomorrow will be relatively easy."
"okay. we had 62 - plus 62 1, plus 0.1, plus 63 1, and i'll take yours."
okay. pads and everything are in the work. may- be we could clean up a few things now. we need the noun 20s on page 212 in the contingency checklist. that's from the lm.
yes.
okay.
roger.
"yes, sir."
"what do you need, charlie?"
"well, i tell you, i woke up at one time - and i listened to the noise, and i thought the thing was off. i thought to m_self, ""great, somebody got up and turned the cabin fan off."" 0b 22 l0 ll lmp i was burning up down there. i just about got up and got the hoses - ... them down there. 0b 22 l0 16 cdr boy, you should have done that before you went to bed. get yourself some air."
"okay, but - we can get it open. you don't get the handle all the way open. it'll never come any further than this, charlie."
"okay, thanks."
stand by.
"that's all right, we've got these two."
"okay, jack. now you can put the lcg itself; that is, take it out of the inner bag, put it in the outer bag, and stow it some place; we recommend u-i, but you can stow it wherever it's convenient."
that's right. you always want to stay way ahead; i hope i can do that tomorrow. i'll find out. i don't see why not. we'll be spring-loaded to a think-ahead condition.
"oh, you're kidding. okay. i'll do that right now."
"houston, apollo ll. i am going to start a ma- neuver to p22 attitude at this time."
roger.
"yes, just a second."
"and, joe, i just put my diverter to min, and i never tried it on the rover before, but the con- trols are very easy to reach."
"okay. and when you get to power 6, you ought to see a circuit breaker page, panel 11."
"yeah, i'm positive, unless they got a cap on, they're empty. okay, tony, we fou_id them."
it's really bad.
"okay. my comment's are exactly the same as neil's. in fact, everytime i get down in one of these little craters_ i sink in a lot further. i'd say our footsteps are sinking in -"
copy that. i_p-eva central station is ... gene's little pet job makes these things slide out by themselves almost.
"okays that will be one step off your presleep checklist there, see. and after the presleep checklist, we'd like to add ""accept vhf."" and what we're gonna do here is get you configured for the vhf bistatic test during your sleep period, so disregard the vhf part of your presleep. and at 155 -"
right. we've got about 67 percent - -
say again?
"mark. a flash at the 12 o'clock, intensity 4. 08 05 16 25 i24p that was right down the plus-x axis, joe."
okay. it's 210/3.4. 102 sa7y
- - 22 ... 200.
"in the ... pocket. lf[f hey, gene, can you attach this to something up there? okay. _id ... ou_ of here again."
"the ags thinks we're 50 miles, dick."
h-dot is a little high ...
"okay. we'd like you to go reacquisition now, and we'll command."
"jim, are you climbing off the rover now?"
(laughter) yes.
... it should be on now.
"and the boulder fields that a1 pointed out - the rocks and boulders are getting more numerous toward the top here. however, it's nothing like the rubble and the large boulders that we saw at the nevada test site. now, this is surprising to me. i expected it to be more lillethat. but it is not, at least, not where we're lcoking now (heavy breathing). jonfidential"
"okay, that sounds good."
"i was almost in the right a_titude to start with. hey, now, would you guys, in a little bit, not look? it sure is nice to get somewhere more than a minute before you have to be there. and we're all set up. i got the window shade up and the camera installed, and we're all ready to go."
"oh, that's right. yeah."
i said thank goodness for that.
"okay, both ... are off.... wanted them."
"well, that's what i'm saying. we can use these fans right here and use the circulate air right through the use of those fans."
"oke_, while we're waiting for the caution and warning, come turn around and i'll unstow your ops - 02 actuated - if you'll bend forward slightly."
and the rake and the scoop?
"okay, after your fourth frame, you're going to change the shutter to 1/15th of a second. and - and then take four more frames at 30-second in- tervals."
"ken, you having any luck with that lock yet?"
"for ti-is s_nount of time_ we can really only get the - the ones that are essentially there. 04 21 ih 05 ia{p yes, let me grab sunother weigh bag, because you're too far away for me to - - 0h 21 _4 08 cdr a_ninch in diameter. oh 21 4_ 15 ilvfp - -.can't help you veo' well this way. put some- thing together in a minute. 0i 21 h_ 45 cdr i think i've got them, ed. dh 21 44 47 i_p okay. i'll get one for the fines. age> _04 onfide 5 04 21 44 49 cdp get one for the fines and we'll start - i'd just say, just grab an undisturbed site out of each quadrant, we didn't hit with our feet. cut it down to about a centimeter level - and fill 5he bag that way. ok 21 45 13 l},_: okay. you want the medium-size scoop cr the big scoop roi' this?"
"ken, houston. the comm may be a little better now, if you'd go through the problem again."
must be getting near the earth; nv sinuses are starting to bother me again.
0k_ r.
"well, after all, it is 5:25, cape time."
okay - -
"well, that's the bag that goes in bag 5. and bag 5 goes in the src. jim, just let me take out the - the unused core tubes. joe, speak up now if there is anything else you want to put in bag 5. i'm going to take it over to the mesa. yes, there's - there's no sense in putting bag 5 on the hand- tool carrier, joe, because it's just about full. why don't we put it on the mesa or in the src, or something."
"okay. be getting that out, and you can give us the attitude for tv."
"houston, we've had a problem. we've had a ,_ main b bus undervolt."
*** on there. 05 00 19 21 l_p-eva got to keep those mzsa blankets on this west side closed. i - the sun's on that side of the mesa.
ready for pan camera mode to standby?
"well, i think we ought to get below the highest peak up there because that seems to have the rocks on it."
...
and all of those are rounded. c
okay. updata link breaker ts coming open.
"now, just a second, pete, i haven't got this etb rigged. one second."
"hello'_ apollo ll. houston. one request: the optics switch to zero. and we've got a lot of theories on why it maneuvered at seven-tenths a moment ago, mike, but no real definite answer. we'll be back with you later. over."
i'll leave it in slew. relay to us. see if they (eagle) have got me now. i've got good signal strength in slew.
"well, i guess that meens yes. delta p and the g_m_a ray extend wes 2 plus 37, end on the mapping camera, retract wes 3 plus 32."
"okay. houston. minus a half, plus - -"
"vance, jim's going to go to vox now."
roger-roger.
"endeavour, falcon. if you're reading, we're not reading you."
"well, i can give it to you in hours from entry interface right away - 38 hours _2 minutes and seconds. and in miles, you're 1_3 500."
"it goes back to whatever it was, doesn't it?"
"15, this is houston. how's the view up there?"
okay.
roger. we'd like to have you verify that all the vents are secured before we spin it up again.
you sure you're sending us to the right place?
"it's in there for the - the maneuver to the - yes, the eclipse attitude."
you got it.
do you happen to have two stars to recommend to us? we got a 405 here.
"okay. look at 12:30. see that large block sitting up about - i'd guess it's a quarter of the way up hadley delta. one of the few - well, probably the only large block on the side of hadley delta."
"is it a double crater, al?"
roger. reading you loud and clear.
- - should see the lm.
_/_at?
okay. we'll follow that little box just like it's in the flight plan. go ahead with your - the rest of your updates.
okay. ready to go on the food?
and it's been there since we laun - it's been there ever since we launched.
*** and ecs. can you see that?
this thing is leaking like a sieve.
it looks like a rainbow. dark one.
pitch 1 - 1 and yaw 1 to start.
"okay, mine's off. and - let's see. connect the i_ 02 hoses, red to red and blue to blue."
"oh, yeah. 06 02 40 08 i_4°-eva i definitely think - about - this is fine here. get on up a little bit on the - that full throttle?"
"yes. i'm still with you, charlie; go ahead."
outstanding. that's got to be a first.
okay. i'll tell you the numbers i read; you tell me if they're right.
"roger. very weakly in the noise, but i think i can copy. go ahead."
"okay, x-ray/alpha covers coming open."
"still no good words about the gravimeter, huh, bob?"
"and when you get a chance, al, i need the - the uv bracket. 00 00 59 36 _ okay."
"how are things on the home front, t.p.?"
"america, houston standing by."
"it's working, but we got to check it out. it comes up very shortly, i understand. some time today."
"stand by 1, ed. would you verify this hose for me? 05 15 46 44 lm_) okay."
make him ...
"hello, joe. how are you?"
better last night?
"okay, we copy. you should be about 40 meters from plum. is that right?"
"america, houston. we'd like to try antenna i again. we'd like you to go extend for barber pole plus 3 seconds, then off, then retract."
okay; we'll see if we can locate it.
"roger. pete. _k irl_rk i?1 a i,._"
"okay; i don't feel it. we ought to start from here, john, and do a radial sampling in towards plum."
i'm now in the area of the minus-y struv taking some ... photographs.
that's for sure.
"and, houston, while al's getting that television, i'll go ahead and get my contingency sample; get it out of the way. iikdnfide"
roger. you getting hungry?
"... what are you going down there? ... _,-_mp yes."
"okay, fred-o, good show. on row 4, starting with ecs: suit fan 1, close; glycol pump auto transfer, close. under comm: vhf b transmitter, open; vhf a receiver, open. under pgns: signal strength display, open; imu operate, close. under eps, row 5: cross tie bus, open; and inverter l, close. over."
yes.
go.
"okay, aux water's on. we got our tones - our tones f yesterday. can you see anything?"
"we got casper's keeper over in the lunar module taking a peek, and we'll be closing it out and we'll get it in a minute."
"okay; stand by 1, and i'll get them ready."
"that fine, dick. fine. very good. 05 23 02 23 i24p you're nearly there, babe. you just let me burn them out. l day 6"
"hello, houston; orion. over."
"okay, and we're going to p52 attitude now."
what happened - any problems?
"... really cling to that stuff. getting it off your - separate, simultaneous communication link in use between cc and @4 06 22 44 -- begin lunar rev 46"
got a bag.
you really sit high.
isn't that?
omit the vhf.
not too good.
"yes, you better leave that camera bracket up there. 00 00 32 50 _ yes. yes, i can feel a little bit of the zero-g effect, a little flushing in the face."
all right.
just got it.
... over_
uv is going on. okay. let's open a few covers.
"okay; understand. at 163:10, you want the image motion increase to barber pole and on."
- - putting the collection bags on now?
...
"it's not time-critical, fred, but if you have the people awake now, you might go ahead and do it. incidentally, you probably know this, but the next several hours are going to be pretty quiet from our point of view. we're working on the entry procedures and should he ready to read them up to you in about 8 hours; and between now and then there's not an awful lot going to be going on, so you guys could be catching up on your sleep schedule. over. 04 17'23 22 l_tw_ okay, jo_."
"okay, stand by."
yes. cut him off in midsentence. yes. we got the two things he wanted.
"okay. we're in p40, and let's check noun 40."

casper_ houston. how do you read?
mark cdr.
the problem with looking at the earth (laughter) particularly antarctica_ is it's too bright.
okay.
"okay, if you'll give us accept, we'd like to up - update your state vector."
what is it?
or that was - stand by.
let's get rid of it.
... could look at this.
"roger. stand by, antares."
"where are we getting any flow from, i wonder?"
...
"okay, i never did give you that. it's ll0 and 136."
"sounds like you guys are really living it up up there. all that music, food. i didn't say drink."
okay.
... why don't you do that?
okay .... uv bracket.
okay. got you.
"okay. sta - stand by for 2 minutes, john."
... jumps so the lakers will want you when you get back.
"roger. get out of the way please, jack, and we'2! take a look against some bright soil."
*** fan?
"roger, dave. we're not going to ask exactly for a mark when you ingress the hammocks. and, by the way, i think the space program is the any - only place where a person can ingress a hammock, but we would like a status report on the two of you when you get comfortable. and, a final thing, you might be interested, the score of the all star game at about halftime is the baltimore colts 14j _-_ college all stars 7. and we'll be standing by for your status report. over."
okay. what else can we do for you?
it's off.
... over.
9kay; 5 plus 24 plus 20.
"yeah. yeah. that's a hard valve, isn't it? okay, it 's closed."
"get one from the command - _p -- we've got our data card book - - _p what do you need? a p30 pad? _p - - stowed away. can you read each of the items, and i'll copy down the pad that way?"
he's going off the bellyband.
would you brush the - that white thing off for me?
"okay. wait a minute, john. you're hung - okay. you're clear."
"then we'll get a©s from carnarvon. we'll get a go for tli, and we'll burn the son of a gun. o0 02 12 o1 l}_ beautiful. o0 02 12 10 c_ some ride. c$ ',4fident! i"
"roger. we did not see the 231 load go in. could you verify that, please?"
"okay, we came to the end of the eva-3 prep and post card."
"john, i think we can just leave you - those - doomaflickies - the core tubes in the - in there, and then when i get to the next place, i can - -"
"well, i guess we weren't aware we had that many problems. i thought this was a rather trouble- free flight, myself. we went a long way, we spent a long time doing the job, and i think, relative to the number of systems we have in all the space- craft, that we had very few problems. i can think of none that were significant that would enable me to compare it with gemini viii at all. we had a - i guess the first little problem we had was a - a leak in our water system, which was cleared up rather rapidly by somebody having already done some investigation and having a procedure at hand. i believe our system is such that people have all the anticipated problems understood, and, when they have them understood, they come up with solu- tions which are quite meaningful and successful. and i feel like the spacecraft and the life-support systems on the moon and everything worked exceed- ingly well. i - i guess really i couldn't ask for much more. how about you?"
burn's complete.
"tuna salad, chicken salad."
"and, houston, aquarius."
"yes, sir."
okay.
okay.
okay.
"yes, they pressed me into service because they have - we woke up the challenger and they needed someone on that one, so i'm over here. still cold and cloudy."
and the front of the probe looks okay.
"yes, we _o, charlie."

"okay, charlie."

"oh, beautiful, i'm glad to hear that. okay; your general direction right now, it's pointed to the southwest. you can probably look down and see the _ lm_ shadow. and, the sun is at about 7:30 to you now, so, you don't get in that kind of trouble."

okay - -
that's going to come out with the etb ....
"fred, we're recommending auto maneuver. over."
that ought to be us.
did your ags agree? what?
"okay, fred. the one i've got for you is at the end of power removal from the command module lm umbilical. and just for your information, after you go through that entire procedllre and about the time you're ready to transfer to the command module, at that time, power will be removed from the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it. that is, after you've thrown the switches in the lm. is that clear?"
"challenger, we'll have a story on that for you later. we don't think we were really low level."
"verify tunnel hatch, pr_sure equalization; and tunnel vent valve, closed. they are. ron, is the tunnel vented yet?"
sure hope tha% color difference shows up in - on picard.

"seven feet, cross-sun? a little too far away, old f buddy."
"yes, cycle it back, and your se audio, closed?"
"okay, we'll go ahead and go the - and do the imu fine align right now, if that's okay with you, houston."
copy that.
"hank, what was the jet you wanted to have me turn off?"
"yes. i got comm, but -"
it's either that or anorthositic gabbro we saw up on the front. up on the massif.
"amd fred, houston. in a little while here, i'm going to have a procedure that i want to read up to you and have you copy down for futture use. it's a procedure for powering the command module main bus off the lm, and it's something that we feel that's going to come in real handy later on for such things as popping off the command module entry batteries, and also possibly for doing some preheating and preliminary powering up of the command module before we get rid of the lm. we'll have that for you in probably 10 or 15 minutes. over."
"oh, it's kind of - bunch of high clouds - cirrus, i guess, - but it's down around 35, i'd say, and and pretty windy. so it's nippy when you're outside."

okay. cabin warning light is off.
"now, i don't know."
that's the game.
"no, they should be off. isn't it off?"
okay. i would say let's worry about that later. and the word is that we'll just go ahead with the normal dump on the back side as it's scheduled in r the flight plan.
happens to be pay day. it's the 15th.
stand by.
yes.
"roger. o0 02 49 28 _ okay, tfouston. i'm going to omni charlte. oo 02 49 43 _ gordy, you got omni charlie. over."

"when you feel up to copying, 11, i've got a couple of small items in the way of a flight plan update and your morning consumables update. ov©r."
wait a minute.
"one of those crater-fill materials that you also see in other kinds of depressions other than cra- ters is a very smooth, light, plains-forming material. and it is, although eratered, when you see it at the terminator, it is smoother than the mare; that is, it does not seem to have the swell, the sea swell characteristics or ridges or other features other than the crater's superimposed on it."
"turn on some more water, charlie. i don't know if i can stand this or not."
thank you.
okay.
roger. was touch and go on that because at one time they're losing that game.
...
integrity check; okay.
someday i'll get up there.
"okay, i'm going to move your hose back to back. okay, charlie, i'd like to get your - str - i'd like to get this strap a little better on you."
okay.
"no. and i dropped the core tap. but i recovered those smartly. i'm getting where i can bend down in that suit, tony. when i first started off, i was going head over heels, but now - look at that stupid thing. there. okay, one more pin .... lock the collar, and the drill is loose. come the core stems. walking into a little 3-meter crater here, tony, you can see. really dig in when you go into those craters."
"see that rock right over there on the little mound, just projecting out of the edge of it?"
"fir - 15, this is houston."
"could you verify that you gave us narrow on the high gain antenna, please?"
"houston, battery compartment's 1.9. you happy with that now?"
"- - thrust a and b, off."
"roger, joe. would you start with delta-vt, again? i missed that."
"man, that is hard. there's the same clast over there."
"odyssey, houston. 0', 2! 0 l _,(] cml' go :jjlead."
"aa-ah. think i'll get an aspirin - a couple of aspirin again ... 02 20 51 43 l_p i'd like a couple of aspirin, too. 02 20 51 49 iamp well, would you like some pictures?"
"okay. incidentally, at the rover, our bearing was 018 and range .2. that's pretty good for a trip like that."
"()kay, i just want to set it here so you don't knock it over."
okay.
"roger, we got the dump valves in view. over."
can we go back now to the very first one?
"oh, stand by, joe. we've got 1, 2, 3, 4."
"orion, this is honeysuckle. we're still having a little trouble with the incoming from houston. we should get it restored very shortly for you. sorry about the delay."
"okay, that'll make the surgeon happy."
"okay. we understand it's in good configuration again as far as alignment and leveling is con- cerned, jack. let's go on and take some more alsep photos, and let them think about it for a minute."
"i don't like this strap in the way up here, al."
okay. i got the idea.
about 15 feet?
roger.
"okay, bag 404."
okay. do you want me to give you a callout on the systems test meter positions or not?
"okay. 33072. let's - add scmething ... 03 04 24 h9 imp yes, that figures. 335. 03 0h 4h 52 c_ and we're 330, so we're 0.5. we pass?"
there you go.
fifteen more seconds.
ail my comm breakers are in.
okay. l_-lm that's good. i can reach it.
roger; thank you.
"you wan_ to _ive me the - everything from p12, please? ..."
go s_head.
"ail righty. we're about 4 minutes from los, and all systems have been looked at, and they're all looking okay. so, guess we'll see you on tother [sic] side."
"okay; all the talkbacks are still gray, houston. it's pitching around now."
then you can go ahead. i'll walk back.
okay.
"say a_air:. 04 22 07 32 lc is src n=nber 1 sealed, and clcseup camera off? 0h 22 07 35 cdr src n'mmber 1 is sealed. ot 22 07 38 12_ and verify that closeup camera is off."

"roger; and, in connection with that, we'll ask you to stow the high gain prior to going into ptc."
"voice check follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; voice check out. ob 14 17 18 cc okay, jim. that seemed to be better."
"okay; 2-16 - 2-16, line 4, ""20 seconds"" to ""2 sec- onds,'' and 2-17, same line is ""1/15"" versus ""20 seconds."""

"okay, ken. in about 15 seconds, you should be north of b_llialdus, and we'll have you go to f/5.6 at that point."
"no, we sure don't want anybody to get in. 07 03 13 34 cdr-_ yeah_ that's right. there's 5000 psi on that door. at least. whew. verify safety on the d_mp valve. 07 03 13 51 lmp-_ okay, it is."
"okay, we'd like to try to get the bulk of this flight plan update up tonight because we won't have the 210-foot dish until 2 hours before lift- off. how you doing up there?"
you got it?
yes.
okay.
fire.
"hello, challenger."
...
"okay, mighty fine. and i think that chamber pres- sure was up around 95. i really couldn't swear to it. so you might take a look at the read-out on the playback."
"we're tweaking now, joe."
it's a beauty.
"hey, that sounds like a good report there. they - sounds like they got a lot of stuff done and also getting a lot of good information out of it already. tape863/5"

"okay, bob, the - the long can is sealed and i guess nobody knows what's in it but me."
"give me number 50 again, please."
"it's surprising. there still is quite a bit of room down there even with the hycon camera box down. and now, i'm going to bring the camera back up."
roger. beautiful.
"houston, _his is 17."
0kay_ you've got po0 and data.
we could burn this - -
yaw right to 98.
"well - the nut that holds the handle of the camera on broke off; and so, the handle's free, but that's okay; we'll just carry it around."
"roger. that's cb essential instrumentation power, main b. over. and it's, closed."
why?
okay. eliminate pcm cable on - on the sextant photo test.
"okay. stand by a minute, karl."
yes; doi-2.
"roger. as soon as we get some tm in here, we'll give you a go."
roger. out.
"(laughter) yeah - yeah. john says sock some water to me, and i just get the breaker, and he says that's enough every time. man, it really freezes you. you can't take it any - any long length of time; you just have to turn it on to get your suit all cooled down in about l0 seconds and shut it back off again."
"and terminal direct 02. okay, i have that. 02 flow high."
"awful quiet, isn't it?"
"well, it's right in my window. 00 02 18 17 i2fp yes."
"all right. lrs°-eva and, houston, *** the temperature limit on the dsea?"
"okay, everything looks good. helium valves are open. pressures are great. past the 10 seconds."
okay.
minus 2.0.
don't forget to dust your camera.
righto.
"the heat flow experiment electronics, when you go over there for that uht, was aligned."
...
"okay. and then as i said before after - after docking, at - at this time, we're showing you an hour and 30 minutes for the transfer. and then you'll come inside, have an eat period, and hope- fully start the rest period. and your rest period will start at about - -"
"okay, 354."
"okay; understand. ""cb 02 tank 100-watt heaters, 3 main b, open."""

"*** makes any difference. *** and locked, and dust cover, verify. *** the comm?"
"no. it's just in the procedures. it's been that way. they said that - that if the solutions agree close enough to pass the test, to keep them independent."
roger.
"see, it doesn't do it here."
yes.
"i think you're looking - probably - that may be rudolph, right there, jack, out your window. *** looking more at those boulders and trying to stay in the spots in between them than i was - -"
"go ahead, vance."
"i doubt it. not when you consider the fact that we got to get - how many hours it's gonna take to get suited up and jettison the la{tomorrow. it's gonna take all day to do that. well, what do you got to do now?"
"those walking hinges are no longer any good anyway, after we get down to this point. okay, now sit down ... it's bouncing out."
"good spot right there, i believe."
roger.
okay. (eagle )

"roger. and - if you could give us the high-gain angles there, we'd like to get that going."
"ron, we're ready for pan camera power to off. and did you go to heaters after you set the self test switch to self test, when we started this?"
- - ...
okay; good luck.
yes.
"roger, al. copy. and i'll see if there's any- thing else they want to do here."
okay.
... yes ... down to 270 ... }'age249
"i say that photoelectric cell amplifier for the master alarm is a good device. it's working very well, and it's a nice pleasing tone."
copy.
okay.
"okay. good thinking. we are - it's - there has been a lot of consideration of what kind of maneuvers to let you do to i_botograph the lm, i mean the service module. we consider it quite low priority; the feeling is that it will be real nice to get pictures of the service module, but they are not required for our troubleshooting program. as far as the - the attitude control authority, and so fortb_ we will get you more detailed word on that later; we are working it. it appears that using the a(]a instead of the ttca after s_rvluu module jett will give you excellent attitude control authority, and that's what we recon_nend."
"hey, ron, could we ask a question about the heat- flow experiment setup?"
"oh, okay. why not? 04 l0 48 34 i_p-i_m get to work. 04 l0 48 35 cdr-_m very easy. 04 l0 48 37 lmp-i_m master alarm. 04 l0 48 38 cdr-_m check. turn up the - the anun/num lights there. 04 l0 48 48 i2_p-i_m anything. 04 l0 48 51 cdr-seva oh boy, what a view."
need the spring to hold the nose down here.
"ron, i just might draw your attention to the flight plan at 167:20, in that area where the lunar sounder finishes up, and it says that there will be no sim bay or pcm data recorded until 169:03 and then you have to configure the dse there. just want to draw your attention to that."
"no_ that's it. i_ .._ 2c - - item 17. just change the last pa_ of the statement ""stow on a-i"" to ""stow on a-7""; and, on item 19 there, change from ""stow on a-7"" vo ""stow on a-i"". that's it. c_[p tiaat's it? okay? we cmn do that, i think. l_ ..."
"no, i sure don't."
"okay, jack."
that right?
... recognize that.
"ken, still looks a little loose."
- - ... triangle bigger than hell.
roger.
after he saw the way you drove.
okay. you got it in pressure?
*** gene's calling you.
"16, houstcn. voice check. tape _8/7"
do you know what we have to do yet?
"okay; i can see - your image is about 2 degrees, now."
"the map was wrong. it's been mapped wrong. we're down in a little swale now, and there's about a 30-meter ridge off to our left about 300 meters; it blocks out stubby. you want us to go up and travel along that ridge?"
"have that static, huh?"
roger. go.
okay - -
"there. screw it all the way down. that could make a guy mad, you know it?"
at 5 feet.
"sps gaging, four, open."
"well, they like to have some of it in black and white, you know."
it's in the cockpit up here. don't we want to leave that out?
that's going in bag 41 - 410.
soil - that 's right.
"okay. in the csm, on panel 5, we want cb lm power 1 and 2, open. then the lm power switch to reset, release. in the lm, panels 11 and 16, x lunar bus tie breakers closed. on panel 16, the ascent eca control closed; the descent eca control closed. on panel 14, bat 5 normal feed 0n, followed by bats 1, 2, 3, and 4 low voltage taps on. then bat 5 normal feed off. then ascent eca control breaker open."
ohl i didn't check that - that comm.
"no dust, joe, no dust at all."
go ahead.
"yes, we are; go ahead. tape25/4"
"okay. don't forget your gnomon. whoo! oh, boy."
"righto. okay, al. and we'd like the high gain antenna to auto and when you've got a moment, we'll pass you up a tei-45 pad, but i guess there's no big rush on that."
"*** eau_ht in something? yes, it is. you're - hold it - wait a minute - get up, get up, get up. you've got - you're sitting on - get up."
(laughter) 03 08 36 0! cdr so what did they put on my leva?
"boy, i wish ..."
"do the ... so i can take two swaths, if you want."
(laughter)
... houston coremtech on 16 - 7 ...
what was the pdi time?
"it may not be when we get back there, judging from the looks - looks of us. that's good to hear, though. it's a good bird. so is this one."
thank you.
"okay. well, i got a new one on that somewhere."
that - that spot's been in the same place flashing. is that what you said?
good show.
stand by.
yes.
...
"okay; that small? aw, the stinker."
that's where it is. we're climbing.
"okay, you want me to try and stationkeep ... 04 02 ob 57 cdr say again?"
"oh, that is interesting! what in the hell?"
okay. we got plenty of time - after the burn?
"okay, ron. we copy all that. o! 22 15 20 cmp yes. i think there is a general migration of - of the cells. kind of toward the bottom of the circle, if you want to look at it that way. they seem to be stretching kind of in that direction, too."
"that'd be - be pretty good to miss it on landing and fall in - fall in on it before taking off, huh?"
"okay. now let's go down and get that unusual one. - get that unusual - one. there's a dense - and there's another unusual one; look at the little crater here, and the one that's facing us. there is a little white corner to the thing."
roger. that's what you're supposed to do on copernicus so you remembered better than me on that one. it wasn't 30 seconds - -
right; 24.
"that's affirmed if you - if you're there, we'd like it."
"columbia, houston. we have a p22 update for you, if you're ready to copy. over. j 04 07 06 27 cmp at your service, sir. (columbia)"
"that's what i thought. it looks pretty good. 07 09 31 28 cml° houston, did you get me on logic go and the omni?"
"and, joe, the 0ps checkout has 5700 on mine and 5600 on jim's."
"apo]lo 16, you have a go for i2_jett."
"well, they don't necessarily have to be volcanic, gordy. i refer to them as alteration, and much of the hydrothermal, or hot water, alteration we see on earth is related to recent volcanism, or ancient volcanism; but, also, we know of that kind of alteration of preexisting materials to take place as a result of - of just fluids working their way up through the earth's crust, and i presume that such a process is also possible on the moon. the ones we saw seem to be associated with areas of dark mantle of various types, and t most of the photographic evidence we have is that those dark mantle deposits are associated with volcanism, but it is not necessarily proved yet, i believe, that the - the orange soils or the alterations we've seen are volcanic. however, the tape188/4 process would be a related process, that is, one of internal origin."
"okay. it's a pretty good one, but it's too big to sack, unfortunately ... - -"
we're getting there slowly.
"okay. houston, deca power is open at this time. do you want me to close it?"
"okay. it's on the left-hand column, right at the bottom line; it says ""read plss 02 quantity to houston."""
"gdc's alined. 00 04 14 09 _ okay; det, reset."
"okay, jack. as long as it's only i foot high and l0 feet away, that's satisfactory."
okay.
yeah.
"well, let ms get a piece of that side since it was underneath. then we'll roll it over and get a piece of the other side."
yes; can't even see the horizon.
"now, i need the - i need the eyepiece."
i don't know.
"okay. we'll go clockwise with it. we're clock- wise, and no change."
"well, we got the pan camera figured out for the new whole show, huh?"
and rh - - 00 02 42 37 aa ...
i think i'm probably the only cmp that's ever witnessed an - a lm burn from inside the lm in - in space flight.
"i sure hope so, charlie (laughter)."
going to wind up in what attitude?
huh?
*** lots of clipoff.
okay. i'm putting it together now.
what a rendezvous machine this is.
okay. go with the supplement.
move that thing out of the way. 06 03 10 18 _ where's the data hook?
"you don't want me to kick the lean yet, huh?"
"roger, bob. copied 152:58:58, 153:57:03, 155:55:07, and 157: 53:14. over."
okay ....
okay. o4 oo 2o o5 (clankiug)
"okay, joe. thank you."
"roger, bob. i've got it. it's showing in low at 133:17."
"gene, you dropped out there right in the middle."
"okay, turn it off. l0 00 02 5i cdr looks like _9 to us. go; don't talk about it."
"yeah, that's ... right there. ob 04 53 46 cmp well, that's not - those crater chains there. let's see, we just passed .,. probably?"
"okay, that's a good readback. item india: 112:49:52.35 - - cdr-_ say, gordo."
i owe it to myself.
okay. copy that.
"well, i've lost track. i don't think - i don't think there's any ... -"
roger. sounds good.
"okay, are we in detent 2? 04 00 53 37 _ yeah."
on that other side.
"no, i ... something."
what ?
"yes. right now; yes, it's dropped off to about the 70-percent point, joe, and it was before up about 85."
okay. let's see if that's correct. 04 16 39 hl cc is a1 in mode a at the present time?
okay.
yes.
mark.
"let me loosen it, and get it a little straighter."
okay. and we think you're even farther north than i was saying. maybe it's about 215 would be your heading for there.
"okay. on panel 3: the first three steps we took care of; mode, voice, to voice; power, sce, off; power p_[pto off; and s-band omni would go back to braw_. panel 225: fi,ight bus, main b, will go open; and cb cte, main b, wili go open."
"okay. you want to reset the camera, right?"
"soon as we get rid of the service module, joe, i think i'll be able to maneuver a lot better. 05 ]7 57 42 cc sure thing. 05 ]7 57 48 cdr okay, jack just reported that all thrusters fired on both rings."
coming up on another mark.
good.
"roger. copy, jim. a_ldthe - jack's going to read you the pad right now, so i recommend you go ahead and get started. you shouldn't be delayed by the pad at all. u_ uu }7 _ cc uarius, _u_uuu. i w _uu ju_z u_z,,pad."
"yes. i do that most of the time, i think."
"okay. now you']l back out fairly quickly after you go into this proeeffure. ail we'll need is about 5 minutes of tm, and so if you're ready to copy, here it comes."
"america, houston. at 240:30, you'll be about 10,000 miles out, at which altitude the moon will just about fill up the 250 lens field of view."
roger.
"we're ready. 04 2b 00 13 cdr-eva sun shadow is zero. i am rolled right 4 degrees. i am pitch zero. i can't be rolled right 4 degrees. that indicator can't be right. i question that. if the roll indicator's right, i might be rolled left a couple of degrees."
"okay, houston. did you copy -"
"roger. you're really down low, scresming across, huh?"
good idea.
"roger. we'll be going off here shortly, and we'll pick you up in the morning for mzre."
okay. fine.
okay.
"_a, uplink squelch, enable .... minegoes off. [pplink squelch, enable. okay, s-band - my s-band to t/e; ics to t/r; relay to off; mode, vox, max; a to t/r, receive. okay."
okay.
"hey, joe. is it all right to use the waste man- agement system?"
"yeah, sure could."
"yes, sir; thank you very much. i'll catch that baby."
okay.
"okay, over the top. 08 23 51 01 cmzp it's coming over."
"hey, houston; america. let's press on and pretend like i'm eating between when !'m t_rning the lunar soui{der, on, and off - okay? in other words, let's get the lunar sounde_ pass."
"oh, we log zero!"
"and off on the left there, that's the - the haemus mountains around south of the apennines."
okay. i get a go fron msfn for this?
"well, probably be 6 miles high when we - get over there - pdi."
"that's where you're going to get it. let me see what i need. drill, rack, core bag - drill at i ips. okay. let's go do it right."
"dadg'mmmit, now i can't get the ... 07 00 47 20 i24p-eva okay. i'll take the same set of pictures coming back, tony."
roger; copied that.
yes. can you get it? good show.
"jim, this is houston."
i think the general agreement in the cockpit is that morale around here just went up a couple 100 percent.
two of the corners are - -
okay.
"hello, houston. endeavour."
"roger. i'll wait then. 04 20 27 52 ia_p-lm bob, will you give me the coordinates again?"
"okay, connect - okay, plss mode, cn. bob, we're both going off the air. we'!l get on lm comm."
that 's right. that 's - -
"okay. connect the - okay. now in - audio circuit breakers closed. now, both panels, vha - vhf a, receive; b, off. okay. mode ics/ptt. 05 o1 46 g1 cdr-i_4 hello, houston. do you read challenger on lm corem?"
"let me turn here. wait a minute, i got turned."
"okay, ed, houston."
"well, there were several times there when we were riding along where we'd hit a - a sizable bump and you could - you could see the - the wheels come off the ground and then float through the air and - but dave should comment more as far as the - the driving. and it was really like a bucking bronco, that's true, because i was strapped in. as you know, dave had to strap me in because i had some trouble with my seatbelt, but i - i really did feel like i was on a - a bucking bronco."
"okay, verify ecs caution, h20 sep component lights, on about a minute. okay, here they come. suit gas diverter, full egress; verify."
i'm sure it does.
okay.
"okay, it's coming up."
okay. i'm all set; thank you. and i'm starting with an f/8 and 1/250. and i'll wait for you to tell me when to change settings.
okay. get your gloves out.
"ho-ho, just right for that little can."
i'm trying.
"oh. he never did make it on, so he taped it on. and we don't know whether it's light struck or not, and we don't know why lt popped open. but, we're surely suspicious. we also don't know if it was only partially on to begin with, or that we really did lose film. so i think it's best that we take a fresh magazine which we have, and we'll get those pictures again."
"okay, jim. thank you. and that's all we have down here for the time being. i've been reading the apollo 15 status report that's put out every 2 hours. what's normally several pages is just a page today. and - with very few words on it, the most prominent one being the word nominal, the meaning of which i'm going to look up as soon as i get off this shift. 02 02 11 39 imp very good."
throttle down; 7 plus 22.
"yes. you can maneuver in pgns, jim. i'm sorz?, i thought you were talking about the att hold and the lm jett afterward. you can maneuver in pgns if you want to."
okay.
"roger. ron, you're looking great. we need a - words on the spacecraft condition. we got a couple of rockets out at white sands ready to launch for a uv calibration, and we need the go from you on that."
the holes on the handtool carrier only line up one way.
"apollo 16, houston. 10 03 59 22 651p go ahead."
yas_ _til i gec past the end° i got to get my heading changed about 10 degrees to parallel. we'_e s-bill in the sazae relative position_ bob.
coming up to 7 minutes.
yes.
"good morning, houston. anybody there?"
...
"yes. o_ l$ 39 42 inp okay. mine's on .... rot a clear. don helmets and visors. okay. let me get your helmet for you. stay right where you are. okay. watch your head. got your snaps; that's on pretty good. locked. get your - everything is so light up here. the helmet cover is just about flippine throueh this. out there in the cape, it was a little bit tougher."
"that's right. we want - let's see. 25.6 is normal, so we go to 25.7 to back it up."
"hadley base, this is houston. we think, jim, that mag tango tango is on your camera in the etb now, and tango tango is color. over. 06 17 37 48 i_p-i_ okay. thank you. y- t'age 997 apollo 15 air-to-ground voice transcrit_pion 06 17 38 46 i/4p-lm joe, this is jim. we confirm. we do have color on my camera."
"yes. come on up here, and i'll get the cores up. --"
"okay, charlie. what we saw down here, i guess, when you started the - started the charge, it - it looked like that perhaps you hadn't pulled the bat relay circuit breaker; then you stopped and then - then it looked normal to us."
"apollo 15, houston. you're go to start to spinup for ptc."
"a and b is off. okay. plss mode, commander to b. you get no msfn reception."
"joe, i don't think i got the probes all way down. i think that probably one of those cores may have - been bent or something. what do you think about that?"
"okay, i need those maps, gene. could you hand me the maps ?"
thank you.
roger.
"houston, falcon."
"okay. you can use ww on the 500. on this 1600 millimeter stuffj some instructions that never got up to you and didn't get to us until today, on those 16 millimeter mags, the limit on advancing that film is one frame, and there are two red perforations - two red marks along side the window there, and if you can line up a perforation hole with those two red marks, we ought to be in busi- ness on the 16 millimeter. 06 07 33 52 cdr-i/_ dick, we did that today. we knew about that pri- marily because of the split ring problem. and we made sure all along that those perforations were lined up with the red marks - -"
well.
"horizontal strip across it. horizontal strip abo_;a it, which should take in the upper l0 percent. vertical strip through it. · 06 21 30 12 lmp-eva let me know if i get in your way, dave."
- - i used it.
*** the mazter?
"that's great, it says decongestant - -"
roger.
i'm trying here to figure out where those two ... are. 03 11 02 b3 cmp they should be -
first target at 8:07.
"go ahead, 16."
"ah ha. yeah, houston, i'm looking back at the _. charlie, you can get a picture of the - i cmn get a picture if i put it on f/whatehacallit, and it'll show that - that rock is between us and the lm."
"hey, i - you know what's happened?"
okay.
"yes, joe, sure are. we're just in the middle of breakfast."
"good morning, dave."
"02 service module supply valve, off. ll 01 ll 15 cmp. service module supply is off."
okay. you've got me. (eagle)
we'll - we'll try to switch it ourselves. stand by on the angles.
(laughter)
"okay, houston, did you get the ags cal numbers?"
okay. looks like the cmc's right on.
"okay, how about frame counts on both you guys be- fore you start? 05 22 19 43 i_mp-eva 152 on the lmp -"
"roger. have you got a power reading there for us, geno?"
okay. we got the next milestone. we're counting down to pdi.
roger.
yes.
"yes, it's all open. all set."
go ahead.
"okay, here's the cass - here's the uv cassette."
okay.
that's affirmative. we might - that might be - there's a couple more changes coming at me here but let me make sure i got them straight and i'll call you later. go ahead'with whatever you were doing.
"here, they really don't seem to be. okay. where do we stand? hey, i got to get the ascent batteries on it."
"okay. well, i don't make a habit of following myself. i like to cover new ground."
#** this orange juice ...
(sneeze)
"i am. logic po_r, two, off. sm/ac power coming on. fuel cell reactant valves to normal."
"well, i'll go back and forth once in a while to get a ..."
"okay. what settings do you want on that, houston?"
z guess we aren't going to be that far apart that it'll mess up your ...
"i'll tell you, ron, if you wake up during the night, you might sit there and stare at the second hand then maybe you could count and tell how long you're awake. cm_o (laughter) okay."
okay. t-start: ll4:03:ll; stop: 114:33:18.
johns _he lead we're concerned with is the sternal lead - the one on your breastbone. you mighv jmggme my a _±e bit.
"okay, joe. into the etb goes cdr's camera, and mag november with 76 frames."
"roger, apollo ll. the way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the sep burn that you had yesterday. you'll see - noun 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus x until you read 4. over."
"oh, yeah. i just can't get the darned insulation out of the way. it's a little stiffer than the - 09 03 10 56 cmp-_ffa okay, it's on."
yep.
"press reg a and b to egress. 06 19 12 40 lmp-im a and b are egress. 06 19 12 43 cdr-i_4 okay. with the plss 02 on,we'll do a pressure - integrity check. find that little valve down there."
"loose limits. give me a mark on 5 minutes to go, ed."
"b-l, b-2, and b-3 are as you have them listed."
"okay. i - i guess we don't have a good answer for you on that, bob. they're all stowed away. and _-_ they've all been recorded as we've gone along. is there any particular need for them before tomorrow sometime?"
"okay, dave. thank you."
"well, if i just put the - well, i'll do that. i was going to say you could read the probe temp if i put the circuit breakers in."
"they are egress. cdr-ir okay. put your plss 02 water - no. 06 16 _6 _3 irp-ir on, now. mark it. cdr-ir plss 02 on, ia{p-ir plss 02 on. cdr-ir right. lmp-ir okay, it's on. cdr-ir okay, and mines on. we'11 wait till it builds us up. press flag should clear at 3.1 to 3._, 02 flag is clear at 3.7 of _.0."
"houston, 15."
don't let me - i'm not -
okay. let's get the helmet on first.
"... o0 08 12 29 imp see, you can't see -"
roger. well_ they never stole the continent.
"yes, i know."
"well, you were reading at probably a 90-degree low-gain angle."
"thav has a hint of bedrock, but it's - and that's about on the southwest rim - about 20 percent down from the upper rim of palmetto, tony."
okay. one minute 56 seconds to go. you had a 4c:3and a plus 100007 05 22 29 oh lmp 4(0 and - plus 10000.
"big man, that time."
"here it is, right behind me now. i got it. wheee! there it goes!"
we're going to need him.
that's the old littrow site.
i thought it was after you called p61.
go ahead.
forget it.
"and, karl, on the waste water dump, i overshot l0 percent, just a little bit, but i'm reading - i'm reading about l0 percent now."
"roger. it's beginning to look like the globe that you might buy down at the store, huh?"
"- - not at all. hopefully, it's in the photo- graphs, but we're marking it down - -"
"okay, this is ed. i'm on 3.75; min flow. i'm 40 percent and very comfortable. and there's weird, al. you can see the triple crater in it. it's the - -"
lioh canister is - in the - and the ... box is sitting on the table. and i'm sure that's okay.
i may pull a jim irwin here.
354 for 0.4?
...?
go.
right. that's correct. but we're adding it here anyway. okay - -
"dave, you're loud and clear."
"and, al, while you're getting ready for the mapping camera, if you'll let us, will get an e-memory dump."
"roger. when you get dark-adapted, it may be that things will come through pretty well."
"apollo 13, houston."
... 00 01 26 56 imp i'll take some uv pictures of it.
"oh, okay."
enter. 0v 03 30 53 imp - - enter; 04366.
"no. i was just curious what the recovery area looked like, and i'm sure that my compatriots will clue me in on it, if i'm nice to them."
it looks a whole lot whiter over here. even in the shadow; look at that shadow down there. would you look in the shadowsl they're something'
mark. you have s-ivb to orbit now.
"okay, if they are, cb descent eca and descent eca control, chert. 07 03 22 _1 lmp okays mine are both open."
"apollo 15, apollo 15. roger. understand, con- tinuous barber pole."
yes.
"go ahead, l_qual,'[as."
don't worry about that° i - i can throw those switches on and i think the other guys can mix the food and i can eat it at the same -_ime. no pr oblem.
okay. i - i've got the stationkeeping.
"okay .... torque the noun 93s, after the two marks."
"houston, this is antares. over."
an igneous rock.
"apollo 11, houston."
"roger. 04 l0 55 07 cdr-seva - - about looking around. separate, simultaneous communications link in use between cc and cm 04 09 42 -- begin lunar rev 15"
... by 10 miles.
"ron, if - if you're stowing the ops_ we might want to hold here a second. we're going to want to dump that ops down to as low as possible pressure, and we'll be wanting to give you a go on that. let me get on - get hooked up here around the room. cml° okay. you know, we've still got it out. we thought we'd, you know, stow it later this afternoon some- time."
"houston, apollo 11. go ahead."
"stand by a minute, ken."

"okay, jack. they apparently don't believe you when you said you aligned it last night and they're concerned the shade is not on 20 degrees. copy ll_ on that battery temperature, gene."

"right here? llv[p-eva whoa. yes. swing it. whoa, now swing back over. little more, little more. whoa. little more."
"okay. unless you'd like an explanation of what's to come, i'll go ahead and read through the steps here and pause from time to time to make sure that you're getting it all, and then we can talk about the details of why it's breaking out like this when we finish it."
okay.
roger.
"houston, 16."
pitch.
yes.
"that's affirmative, columbia. it's about 4 miles long. stand by. we'll have you a map location momentarily. over."
"hello, houston. this is america."
"apollo 15, apollo 15, houston is out for the _-_ evening."
"ow. pa 3e14 coj""tf!nti 6"
"orion, do you read on vox?"
- - toes ...
"okay, that'll probably be all right, ed. we're going to have to move out, now."
huh? you need what?
thank you.
"i'll tell you, if challenger hits that south massif amd you're anywhere pointing in the right direction_ you ought to have a spectacular shot."
what's your estimate of the - when we'll be able to see the lm?
you'll have to fix my antenna. (tra_q)
"roger, dave. got them right here. and if you're ready to copy, here they come."
"roger. standby. (cm3ss net 1) tape 67/9 04 08 35 2'5 cc lfello, tranquility base. houston. you can start your powerdown now. over."
"no, but this thing isn't all the way out of the - ... here, let me have this end of it. let me come hack up the ladder a notch."
okay. we copy that.
"roger. cdr-i_4 and the quantity light came on somewhere, i believe, after we landed."
this is the same time as the yaw.
"res sing. this is really a comfortable position, mates. pull on rufflegs like this. really helps your back. doubled up."
"okay, jer. understand, we'll mark on the same thing as this pass here."
yes.
"11, houston. it's pretty hard to describe this view. it's really - really _reat."
"okay. that is correct. then to reconfigure from this configuration, jack, we want you to leave the mai_ bus tie switches in the on posi- tion and pull the circuit breakers out in reverse order that we had you close them. over; and do you want me to read them up individually?"
"okay. 0kay_ stow 70-millimeter, the hammer - okay, stuff that handle. i'm getting it right now. good godfrey. okay, src number 1 coming up."
okeydokey.
where are we in the checklist? let me -
"okay, i'm on page g/9-4, column bravo, line 04 is 13353; that replaces 11522. line 05, 00041 re- placing 13000."
... tei pad? 07 02 22 55' cdr two hours and 5 minutes.
"bob, we don't move around from here too much. i tell you, these slopes are something else."
"i'd say we're about 95 degrees east, coming up on smyth's sea."
"hello, 15; this is houston."
we'll take high gain to auto.
_f_krk. a little light dim streak in the lower right eye - lower left.
"okay, turn it back on."
okay.
...
"mark. light streak - white streak in the right eye, upper center. moving from up - - time skip"
all you really need ...
"okay, copy 153."
"roger. we tad good high bit ra_e data, and they're pouring over chat now. 01 14 34 39 c_l_ okay. i'll sit _ight then. than_ you."
okay. and there was one piece of flight data that we needed that we didn't bring along this time.
"you have po0 in accept. (f;o:::n;],_f]) tape 2/_1"
"go ahead, l?."
right. i think so. buzz is looking through it now. just a second.
"hey, al, you've got a couple of people interested down here in particle clouds now. and, first of all, we'd like to have you verify that you saw particles all the way until you went into the shadow. i certainly believe you did. you were telling me about them just as you were in that position. and likewise, if you have a chance at sunrise tomorrow where you are in that same posi- tion with the sun illuminating you, but not the background, could you see if you - there is any remaining signs of those particles?"
"okay, p2- at 210:35 will be p10, uh, p20 for uv scan option 2. noun 78's are all zeros, noun 79 a minus 0.4 of a degree per second. is that right?"
roger.
"hey, john. how about an emu status check? your - you pulled out your pin on your purge valve."
"scissors, john?"
"yes, i would say that - i think houston is just concerned about us getting down in this crater. we been thinking about it, too, houston."
"this is a great sight, i'll tell you. you're right, i was working ... what we were doing. missed the whole freaking flight."
what was it you wanted to put in the pga bag?
"unless ycu could get - well, you could get the top of that csvc. 06 oh 20 23 cdr-eva where is it?"
and i see a - see a very large crater over at 1 o'clock.
mark.
"which way, left or right?"
"it's worth a few pictures. 06 21 3i 44 ia{p-eva you know, i'm really surprised - -"
"okay. magazine rr has no spare frames. so if you want to take any photos, we are suggesting using the dac and the 75-mm lens and using jj which is very high-speed black and white. ninety-eight percent of jj is unscheduled. here are some set- tings you might use for terminator photographs over mare. use t2.8, 1/500, and infinity. for termin- ator over highlands, use t4, 1/500, and infinity. and for tsiolkovsky on rev 7_ that's get of 232:58; that's sometime in the future here - we're sug- gesting using t5.6, 1/500, and infinity. over."
"aw, come on. i doubt that. that's got to be better - -"
ail right .... - - o0 o1 57 26 i2_p verb h8.
"okay. i understand that. in that case, we'd like to take a piece of tape and tape the cover down to keep it closed when it's not - when it's supposed to be closed. the feeling is that if the cover flaps partly open, you may get specular reflection off the inside of the mylar down onto the mirrors causing it to heat up during the drive when it's supposed to be closed."
"copied 216:03:55, 216:18:30, and 217:18:5 - 15."
"okay. step 9, add, after ""ascent water, close,"" ""cabin gas return to egress,"" ani last change is step 9- delete the first line. over. 07 09 59 03 i_p i got you."
okay.
"well, you know it's hard to see a blanket here, but that's got to be shorty right there. l_-eva okay - -"
okay.
what is it?
thank you.
"okay, i'll say we started ay - excuse me, i've got a piece of candy in my mouth - *** 8:41. camera will go vo operate. _mp 40. 07 13 go 4% _._p m2_rk _, _i."
"okay, it's at 84:32. stand by 1. jack, flight just told me we can wait on this if you want until some other time in the flight plan. we want to get into this experiment checklist with the pa - pan camera, mapping camera film cycling. or we can do both of them concurrently. 02 19 b1 24 cdr hey, bob, let's get the camera cycling out of the way first, and then we'll pick up the flight plan updates."
yes.
"okay. we copy that. ·i_mp-eva okay. oh, man."
"s_y again, neil. over."

"(laughter) okay. secc,ndap_y s-ba2_d po_r a_41: should be close. 07 23 28 54 lmlp okay."
"okay. i'll just read you back the lift-off times, starting with 46, 163 plus 54 plus 55; 165 plus 53 plus 25; 167 plus 51 plus 55; 169 plus 56 plus 26; 171 plus 48 plus 57; and 173 plus 47 plus 29. over."
"yes, i took a reading, jack."
"thank you. and we've got about ten minutes until los at the present time. when you've got a pencil and a paper, i'll give you a short flight plan update and a camera pad."
"okay, hand controllers are locked. directs, off."
copy that.
you had then down there.
"no, that's ail right."
"okay, we - it will."
"watch your foot there, charlie."
"you mean you're not going to come home with a beard, huh?"
"that's affirmative. i don't think we're up to the next one yet, but we'll keep - keep you posted on whether we see anything, or how they're doing."
"okay, !'ye got it marked down. we'll also see if we can find it on some bigger map."
roger. zero.
yeah.
good readback. -_
okay - -
enter.
do you have a wet pack in the lm?
"roger, al. copy. you're in."
lm suit circuit 3.6 to 4.3?
"okay, up one flag."
i got it.
"say again, there, jack, i - i missed that."
"coming up on 1 minute to tig, i_eil. how's it (columbia) looking?"
"mike, are you satisfied with p23 now? 01 03 25 23 cm_° yes, i'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what _t did to oar state vector. still not altogether happy with the various pro- cedures. if we could pick stars withir the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you cculd allow p23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that sub- stellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it."
that's affirm.
"yes, because i didn't - -"
you have it.
...
well - -
"a little navy groggy, i think's what you me_. (music: ""light my fire"")"
"yes. yes, it would have, too."
"would you believe you're looking at chi.cken stew, here? ail you have to do is - 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. now we get our hot water out of a little spigot up here with a (_ozs n_,""r' 1) tape 22/9 filter on it that filters any gases that may be in the drinking water out, and we just stick the end of this little tube in the end of the spigot and pull the trigger three times for 3 ounces of hot water and then mush it up and slice the end off it and there you go, beautiful chicken stew."
"roger, ron. we copied those. _lp no_ it won't make any difference. okay."
that's verified.
got it?
we copy that. and we're running the cal curve.
yeah.
"yes, think it's perfectly adequate."
okay. itvs coming around to the number 1 window. we'll get you ...
okay.
"but the whole thing seems to be pretty well altered, or metamorphosed - compared to the major rock we sampled - to the other blue-gray rock. this bag is terrible. i can't - it won't latch."
"delta-v thrust, and the light is out. okay, it's coming to normal."
hey_ bob: hole-in-the-wall seems to be a - -
"and the uv cover's, coming open."
"it sure is. it sure is. pretty h,,mmoeky and driving is much sportier. 06 01 00 25 i_4p-eva yes."
"no, sir."
"roger, dave. we copy."
roger.
roger. we understand.
"bed - that's got to be bedrock there, babe. yes. let's get some samples of that. 05 14 36 58 l_ got to be."
"two meals tomorrow, breakfast, and two more meals today - -"
"yes, sir."
okay.
"okay; roger. and what we'd like you to do, gene, is we'd like you to get the csvc samples yourself, that will essentially be your sole task at this station, jack can do the solo sampling and we'd like to get one pan and the gravimeter, and then we'll leave this station. we're going to absorb some of the time we spent with the extra gravimeter reading and some of the time we absorbed at sta- tion 2 in the longer stay time in sampling at station 3. that's our plan. so it will be cdr for the csvc for the long cans, excuse me, and"
"okay, and we're about 30 seconds from the t-start time on the pan camera, please."
any suggestions? _-_
"okay, i'm going to go ahead and take her - a mark here and get on this schedule."
"okay .... pitching her down a little bit, right here."
"okay. out beside ""cb (11) and (16) eps,"" scratch the first line there. that's ""descent eca con- trol, two, close."""
yes.
"endeavour, you can give us auto on the high gain. and, al_ vance is sitting beside me here. he's been downstairs talking to the pis about the pan camera, and has some good words for you."
that frame at the lrv sample was about 115.
"stand by. stand by a minute, charlie."
"okay. that side's complete. houston, you can tell america that challenger is at taurus-littrow."
- - alterations to the surface. and that's in highland country where that is a distinct gray against the tan-gray or tan highland background - general highland color.
"yeah, maybe it would."
"yes. t confidential 07 04 27 07 i_mp okay, 30 seconds - -"
go ahead.
roger. f:8 at 250th.
"i see charlie over - charlie's down - down there to the southwest. can i go reset on this thing to clear these numbers off before 2 minutes? 05 00 41 5_ cc yeah, we can go reset."
huh.
"if - if you guys could get an idea down there of the needle you're threading when you shoot for 50 miles at a quarter of million, you'd be mighty proud of yourselves. i'll tell you, we are."
"john, can you velcro that down for me? excuse me. there, that's great. okay. i guess we got to dust and stow antennas."
... hose is stuck.
"ll, this is houston. on the basis of your last p52 alignment, the platform looks like it's indeed performing very well. no problems there, (goss net 1) tape 47/10 no updates required, and no pipa bias update is required either. over."

"okay. you still want mapping cameras, standby, up there in the fourth step?"
"that's a pretty outstanding picture here, i tell you."
attitude's good.
"bob, this big white clast - i'm not sure there aren't - some smaller ones in some of those other big boulders. that's just an intuitive guess."
roger. understand.
"roger. don't move and look at it. it was not that important. if you can see it, fine; other- wise, forget it."
"oh, sure. the crater that i described as looking comparable to shorty, i don't think is the one on family mountain. i think it's the one on - bright dot - about the same size dot as shorty on the l?-l leadin for the - 17-1 for the landmark tracking."
that's right.
"well, it's on the gate right there, just hanging. - i just put it there."
houston; challenger. how do you read?
"... circuit breaker .,. 09 o0 02 12 new apollo 14, this is new orleans, welcome home."

"well, that ought to be pretty impressive. well, we're down to 2 minutes, jimmy."
"and auto on high gain, please."
...
roger.

"oh, man, you're really swinging. okay. charlie, we'll do something about that up-link, and - we're - we're working maybe the switch configuration now."

i'll - collect it.
02 tanks - fans in tank 2 are on.
"wrong transmitter, probably. · al"
hold that for a minute.
okay. we concur with that.
i see a horizontal bedding.
yes.
"roger. speaking of that, the burn attitude's going to be 104 degrees, so you might keep that in mind when you get down here. you're getting kind of close to it now, or - beginning to get close to it."
"no, i haven't."
is it?
okay. we'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13 as far as powered flight goes.
"okay, houston. we've got 60 minutes up here. how's your clock look?"
i've just got to get a picture with the 500 of the old orion sitting out there.
i understand a portion of the mesa blanket's still on the - on the fronz.

yeah. how much did you put in?
"oh! (laughter) easy. easy, ... okay; all the - all the way in very easily with a push, joe."
okay. that's only 20 degrees.

can you tell me which side of the lm sim bay?
"okay. you're not going to like this, but i'm going to give you this one first because i've got it in my hand."

"well, i guess that we all assume maybe you're like the rest of us and turn to your sport page first sometimes. so we thought we'd recap the pro foot- ball action yesterday, in a rather strange day, since there were only - only two games that really made any difference. and i think the scores kind of showed the day. in the american conference playoff games coming up next weekend, oakland will play at pittsburgh. pittsburgh getting into the playoffs for the first time in 40 years. the cleveland browns will take on the undefeated miam_ dolphins, who have won 14 straight. in the national conference, dallas will be at san francisco satur- day, and green bay plays at washington on sunday. quickly recapping some of the scores from yesterday. on that sad, sad one here in houston, cincinnati rolled over the oilers, 61 to 17. there were three touchdowns scored in the fourth quarter within less than 5 minutes of play, all on interceptions - on the part of cincinnati. new york giants, it says, upset dallas 23 to 3. i question the upset since dallas was already in the playoffs; and, in what i watched, it looked like they were aware that they were already in the playoffs. buffalo upset wash- ington 24 to i7. and again it's a questionable upset because o. j. simpson had a great day, and larry brown from washington was kept on the bench for the whole game. oakland, 28, over chicago, 21; detroit, 34, over los angeles, 17. los angeles' hopes for any playoff berth had been knocked out by san francisco's win on saturday, and it looked like they played that way on sunday. cleveland, in a real tough one up in new york with bo-knot winds and a - gale - gale-force winds and lots of snow and cold, defeated new york jets, 26 to 10. green bay, 30, over new orleans, 20, in a tough one, which saw two - two touchdowns being scored off of blocked punts. kansas city, 17, over atlanta, 14. and, again, atlanta's chances for a playoff berth had been wiped out on saturday; and, appar- ently, they played that way on sunday. denver, 45, over new england, 21; st. louis, 24, over philadel- phia, 23. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"

"okay, joe. i'm putting that antenna up now, and i should not point it at any of the experiments. is that correct?"
"but if 6/7 requires more time when we get there, we can borrow it from one of the other stations; i guess, in particular, station 10, probably. as the initial activity then, we are going to have to take explosive package 5 with us, and we'll stick it under the lmp seat, and i'll remind you in real time when we get down on the ground on that one. and number 5, 3 pound, will be deployed at station 10, and again i'll remind you about that in real time, so don't - you don't have to bother to write it in on your checklist. planned traverse proceeds as normal. we're expecting to spend about an hour and 20 minutes at stations 6 and 7, and the sugges- tion is that we may end up wanting to spend that totally at the split boulder at station 6, hut, of course, the option still exists to visit more than one place and sample other boulders if it seems feasible and attractive and desirable. they are suggesting additional 500-millimeter photographs, especially if it seems that we can use those to document tracks and sources of docu - of the sampled boulders; for instance, at stations 6 and 7. we are continuing to hold the nominal 47 minutes at station 8 - that is, 8a, and we still think that's as good a place as any to sample the sculptured hills. station 9 is still nominal 30 minutes, but in view of the similarities to the in - to station 4, we're anticipating a possible desirability to remove time from station 10 to enlarge station 9, but that will have to be a real-time decision, based upon what we find at station 9. station 47 - station 10 continues nominal. we're still interested in sampling the blocks and also interested in - in trenching to try and see - if we can say something about the dark mantle - light area relationship and, perhaps, the nominal coring. we're going to - we're going to deploy ep 5 there; and, other than that, they're basic- ally the same. if we have the time during that closeout, and you'll know if we have enlarged the closeout somewhat, of the lm, based on our experience the last two nights, particularly for dusting; but also, if time permits, in that time we might try and get the - use up the extra double core, if there is one, in the dark mantle near the i_mor do some trenching near the i/4. but that's only if time permits at the very end, depending upon how the consumables run out. they want to call attention to two particular things here. one, since you guys really haven't gotten any very big rocks so far, they're recommending, they say here, and i quote: ""the value of large individual samples has been demonstrated. we recommend that several football-sized samples of a uniform igneous rock be collected at station 9 or 10."" i'll pass that on as that. another point of interest is the l- to 20- millimeter size section of the regolith, the dark mantle, the lithology. then, any observations or collec- tions you can make pertinent to that would be of interest in trying to determine the relationship of the dark mantle to the subfloor units of gabbro underneath. two short questions which i'll ask, which i hope - hope you can answer in just a very few words. one of them is a yes and no answer. one, we - they can't find the geophone photos specifically called out in the transcript. there is probably a little bit of garble at that point, and the people in the back room will be very happy if you could say once and for all, jack, that, yes, you did get the geophone photos. over. 06 14 50 03 ijmp-lm yes."

okay. put it right in here. iconfidenti
okay.
put it in that one right there. can you get it?
yes. down about 8 inches.
reach o_t and tickle your probe.
"no, i'm narrow deadband now."
"set pitch, plus 114."
"you didn't try to ... to go there, you - - 03 23 24 50 lm_ that's right."
"i'm hearing you 5 square, fred. how me?"
"we're working at it, partner."
"in fact, you're coming in a little louder."
"okay, bob the high gain is up and connected."
yes.
"do those blocks look like gabbros, you guys?"
"how'd you like to have the pan camera power, on, here?"
okay. copy that - -
"you want the canister? it's easier to just put the bag in the - in the thing over here. i think. il4p okay. i'll send it over. 07 21 11 33 cmlp what's that? that's okay. that's all right, i'll get it (laughter). doesn't look like it's going to fit."
okay.
"- - one is just a general comment, ron. as you can see, we're cutting into your eat period, and you're going to be awful busy, and your eat period is very short. so, right at wakeup, while you're working, you might be considering getting eat things ready to go up with - ready to eat. you know, just as you're doing you postsleep check and that, you might be getting some food out. you're going to be busier than the proverbial one-armed paperhanger there."
"it's all on, all squared away."
"what, tei?"
data ... get ahold of the - (laughter) it doesn't need aps for - it needs its attitude control.
"and a note here from eecom that, due to destratifi- cation in your oxygen tanks, you may get a eryo pressure light; don't worry about it. that's during the burn."
"okay, houston. i just got a spectacular white rock. it - but it's kind of dust coated. but it is - it's so fine grained that i can't see any crystalline structure associated with it. it's sort of covered with zap - you can see plenty of zap pits. that's going in bag 1 - 13."
did it come loose?
roger. thank you much.
i think they might be ...
ard pc is steady. steering good. we're oscillating ir the roll dead band.
i think our - take one more swath here.
is it half and half? because - -
yes.
"okay. and i guess the etb to go, is that right?"
okay. you might run that by the cpcb and see if they approve our in-house ...
"and let you get suited. and it might be better if you just pull your suit out and stuck it in the corner and got all that stuff out of the tunnel. ·.., we can put it here and - -"
"go ahead, jim. 06 06 31 46 lmp-ir yes, are y'all ready to go ahead with this battery m-uagement? it's called for at 13:29."
let's go get it.
"okay. fine; thank you_ joe. how does the lm look? are you still tracking it? 05 _2 o] .17 cc ail i've heard was that it's that the cabin was holding pressure. i haven't heard anything more. and, odyssey, we're ready for you to warm up the bmag number 2's at your discretion and x we're curious whether the moon check attitude is good. over."
316 and 115 miles. it's in there.
"i see why we planned all this before i came. 06 04 25 41 i_p-eva okay, the plate's installed."
"what's this bright one down here, kind of to the right?"
"looks like ron got a good ops. hope we don't need them for transfer. yes, i checked that thing, i thought."
"yes, that's a definite - we concur with that definitely, gene. don't want you to work into your sleep period."
"..., ken?"
- - with dr .... about the gnomon.
"en - endeavour, houston. best omni, please."
"orion, this is houston. how do you read?"
"hey, houston. i think the ant - the sha - the antenna is aligned and pointing at you."
it looks as if our old friends at ascension are enjoying a fairly nice day out there.
"we'll have one more to put in here. i'm just going to lay this one over here. yes, the big one. man, there's some big ones in there, too. mmmmm $ i_g°-eva we can get same of that subfloor."
"it's black - black colored. right, chartie?"
got a minute to _o to inboard shutoff.
"yes. and the other one's not even circled; it's just north of the - the one in the bottom, and that's the one that even shows up on here and the - impact-type, because it's got ray - ray material, but it's a fresh impact bringing up bluish - bluish-type material."
okay. and the moon just went by at about minus 14 degrees.
"deadband, minimum, att control to mode control; (tranq) mode control, auto, both."
you've got accept.
"stand by a minute, dave."
yeah.
"roger. is it oscillating now, charlie? 09 06 34 58 imp not in reacq. no, it settled out in minus - about minus 15."
"okay. okay, ken- -"
yeah.
we're standing by for your capture call to go free.
can't you go back to zero and try it again?
why don't we have - i thought - we want those ...?
"oh, me! give me some water, charlie. i'm really about to erp."
"oh, man, the television ... _-_ day 4 page 119"
"oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. it's got to be lava flows."
bring that out of there! i can see why that's propulsive.
sure will.
"okay. fine. 06 05 05 39 lmp-ir i could send some tape out, dave."
"okay, aquarius. we're working on what's going to happen next. in the meantime, we'd like to take some high-power items off the line, so on panel ll, open deca power, and open deca gimbal. on 16, open the atca breaker."
"mark, 1 minute."
"i think so, gordy. is that an offer or do we have a choice?"
i just about ended up down at the bottom of the hill.
"tony, it's a secondary. we're at 357 at 3.1, and we got a secondary that's fairly blocky rim. there's one up just to the up - a little upslope from us that might be better. but there's not as mnny blocks on the rim. same size crater."
"()kay, john. here you go."

*** in. locks go in?
"and, again, on the traverse itself, we'll skip the tv getting out, since we won't have ac and all and the high gain, and so you don't have to worry about deploying the tv and tripod, and we'll leave the tv for charlie when he gets the lcru out. we will need a few more words during the alsep deploy or, correction - during the lrv deploy, since we won't be able to watch it. and, our best guess on an alsep area is still sort of northwest of you there, but it will be completely up to you; whatever looks best. and again, the use of the uv camera, we'll - -"
"pitch down. we're going down. i just put in one click down, ken."
"change the ""0 plus 53"" one to ""l plus 10."" change the ""l plus 31"" to the number ""l plus 40"". over."
"that's affirmative. and now, after the mapping camera is off at 201:30, we want to cycle the laser switch off for i second, then on for 15 sec- onds, off for i second, on for 15 seconds, et cetera, for 20 cycles. and after 20 cycles, we will leave the laser altimeter, on, for mefn analysis. over. 08 08 57 08 cml° okay; understand. you want at 201:30 - you want to cycle the laser altimeter, off for i second and on 15 seconds, for 20 seconds - for 20 cycles, and then leave it turned on."
"columbia, houston. recommend you take sextant marks and do not reinitialize. over."
and a reminder that eventually you're going to have to turn to the south a little bit to pick up - the final thing at the - station 2.
ready to turn the card? 04 l0 43 ll cdr-in yes. hold it. 04 10 43 32 lmp-in i'll hold it if you'll push it on there. tape69/12
roger. go ahead.
"and we're right now 347 for 4.4. a little de- pression here, jim."
okay. we think you guys are getting to the point we ought to swing a little bit west - -
okay.
quit having a good time and go to work (laughter).
roger. copy that.
we're lapping it up down here. keep talking if you feel like it.
"oh, okay. i just wondered. i got a lot of noise, but i hear you loud and clear whenever you talk."
well - you got a - you got the pan.
"oh, i read you loud and clear."
i got it. that's a big rock.
"no, that's - that's just to go back to now."
can't make the etb stay closed. 07 03 05 42 lmp-i2_i huh?
"okay, gordy. the lmp ops is 6100 psi, 6100."
"okay. i'm going to go up there and get it. jack is - and fred are asleep, so i'll be off the air a minute."
"roger, dave. i think you still need the mag from the dac and from the 5o0-millimeter camera."
the indicator is still at full.
"yes, i'm going to do it like that on all of them. ·now, when you come up on a thing like that, el says t-start minus 1:40 -"
"okay, ken. it's running. tape36/2 02 06 17 21 cml° okay, and are we gonna check out the alarm function, or are we just gonna check out the loading capability?"
okay. stand by 1. let us look at it.
roger.
let me tell you - my hands from that drill - -
that's okay.
roger. understand.
"okay, we start earthshine photos in about 20 seconds."
"orion, this is houston. how do you read? 03 21 30 22 _p you're 5 by, jim. how me?"
"aquarius, houston."
"okay, i'll take the items one at a time as they come. first off, the central peak. the central peak is - is a very large - spur peak on the - on the south and east sides, getting blocky on the north side; and there's what appears to be some layering visible on the - on the south and west exposed scarp of the peak, dipping to the north at about 30 degrees."
"it is c_ning out - yes, you're right. 06 05 38 29 cdr-i_ let me check it."
"okay, because it's on a flat bench, too."
it should be open. that - there's no question about that. it should be open.
and could you give us auto on the high gain?
okay. that's okay.
"okay, pete. when this thing drifts through there, i'm going to punch an enter."
- - and 111.
sounds good.
"okay, we copy that. ir on and the cover open."
okay?

ail right.
"right, vance."
okay. it's ... - -
"i'll get the radiation report here shortly, and - could you confirm by position that - h2 fan should be in?"
"that's photo tv sector, f:8, 15, and three. now, i have photoscoop imprints, f:8, 5, two in stereo."
some of them have -

"well, when i looked at them right at first, that's what i thought - but i think that the zap pits are making the white stand out more. they're fooling you a little bit."
"hear me, ed?"
you'll be glad to know you are go for depress.
"want to get all your mags out and stuff like that to take over, huh?"
okay.
"hello. loud and clear, 17. we're with you."

what's the problem?
"okay, here we go, a -"
"what - _here do they go, john? yeah. time skip"
"yes, we ought to get some good pictures. it isn't quite as good that way_ but you do get some picvures anyaow. c_ that's what i was trying to figure ou_. houston_ what's that big crater we're going over right now in fecunditatis? zt's probably on your mad - yes, taruntius_ that's it. yes. lm__ spe_king of grabens again - how's our p_n c_mera doing? c_ _ 38, a_d we s_i±l got 18. 09 1l 50 51 lmf speaking of grabens again, on the southeastern blanket of tar_untius, about a crater radius outward, _here's a crater looks like an impact also on a trace of a graben, and in this case the ejecta blanket that extends out along the graben both to the west and to the east is noticeably blue gray against the tan gray of the fecunditatis or at least the taruntius ejecta blanket. basically, it looks like blue-gray wings on the crater along the direction of the graben."
i'm -
"okay, copy 9 - 90, 00, 00111."
roger.
got it?
"i say i'm sure glad we didn't have a lm impact, too."
"okay, 16. ail we have is the g&n data. we don't have tracking data because you are uncoupled. however, based on the g&n data, it looks like less than 1 foot per second."
jack's at 120 on the heart rate.
"dave, just let me know before you drive."
yes.

let me get my water.
i want to get 63. yes. go ahead.
"okay. i'll - thank you, sir."
"eps system is good. ecs, all indications are normal."
"i don't know, but i've got a lot of dusting to do here."
"on second thought, forget that core tube. it's too granular, and most of the material came out of the tube. i'll just scoop a couple of samples, and bag it, of the two top layers."

"okay. we're headed 354 and going - that thing is taking us straight for the lm, john. downslope is easy."
and open her up.
cdr's prd is 17045.
yes.

work good?
okay. go ahead with the t-start.

okay. drogue removal's coming next.
"he says, seriously, it's looking probably like you won't have any more. g1 l0 59 45 cmp hey, that's real fine."
"jack, i put that there to hold the src down."
and thank you for thinking ahead on that one.

"apollo 11, apollo 11, this is houston. do you read? over."
yes.
okay. we copy that.
okay. just take it slow and easy. 05 o1 38 38 i_ip-eva slowly going in. what i'm doing is letting it do the work.
"- - what this is - go ahead, ken. 10 06 13 19 cml° i was thinking about the things that happened today. we didn't have to do anything. it didn't lock up anything, and it didn't look like even zeroing the cdus had any effect on it."
...
let me look - -
... - g&n power .... ?
you got an upper?
"we're going to give gene his auto mechanic's license if it works. 05 18 14 57 cml° how's my - yes, right. how's my zpn? ail i did was move it. i didn't put in a new sensor yet. do i need to put on a new sensor?"
"roger. i am told that we'd see 38 degrees for that package, and it'll be okay for the burn. we're massaging the detail procedures for this burn at this time and we expect to have a real clean setup to you in plenty of time."
"no, we'll change it from the cue card."
have a wet pack.

"hey, good show, pete; good turning."
"houston, 15."
how's your biomed look now?
"that's affirmative. 05 00 20 27 _p okay, looking at alphonsus, i'd say that there's this a - well, you can see this obvious little band that we talked about that runs north and south through there. and that's an entirely different texture than what you see on the material on either side of it. but it is the same on either side. looking from north to south, i don't see anything that's - i can really call - i couldn't - that says there's any topographic relief going from south to north. there's no demarcation that's evident that's different at all. although there is some of this material that's in the south that runs towards the crater center that does, indeed, look like it might - might be tapering down and thinning out. i'll come back to that in just a minute. let me pick up davy."
"yes. i don't remember anybody having to use them, and both my docking window and - and both al's window and my window - we've collected moisture on the lunar surface, and we've started collecting it, here, in flight; so, i put the window heater back on."
"okay, jim. how is the comm now? over."
"okay, al. that's a good readback. and, al, let me advise you that be - because of your orbit, the tpi is going to be nonnomlnal in angle, about the - about the same delta-v; however, a different angle. we'll have more words after insertion. 4"
where is it? i can't see it.
i want to get around here and get a burn report off.
it just got dark.
"go ahead, bob. _ 09 09 29 06 cc okay, at 226:22, on - it will be a line above the line that says ""x-ray, on."" the new line that will be added will be ""x-ray, off, for i second; then."" over."
did they hear?
roger. cdr-iai we'll get a picture of america coming right across it.
ail right. that's a good idea.
"i'd say less than a half an inch, if that, but they're here."
stand by.
"don't worry about it, dave. we see you starting to come into view now. - -"

"endeavour, houston. i need omni alfa."
okay. now i'm - this is using up a great deal of rcs which is going to violate the next line. is this preferable to trying to do a regular rendez- vous now?

and we're go for door jett.
"yes, he's at the extreme right-hand edge of our picture, al; and you're off. 04 20 co 17 odr okay. we'll turn them back on. this is where _{e're going to deploy. oh 20 00 22 oc well, i guess the primary consideration, of course, is to find a good site, and our being able to watch zou is secondary."
okay.
"pete, it doesn't seem to be acquiring in reacq, and i stepped it through."
i don't know where the hell that came from.
"yes, sir. okay. we read the tge, i'm going mode 1."
take a little jog over here to where it's a little smoother.
...
"well, we're not. i just don't want you to."
"17, houston. you can go back to block now."
"and, ken, you don't have to acknowledge, but john and charlie just got back into the im, and they're just repressurlzed."
"(laughter) it does, doesn't it?"
"bob, when we come out of ptc, then you want us to go right to the sim door jett attitude?"
"sure is, karl. no question about those mountains being there and where we're at with them. 03 07 25 _l cc they stand up on your horizon, do they?"
photo bay b - -
okay; we copy that.
roger.
and back it up with a start. okay; go vox. go vox. 07 23 35 27 _.fi_ vcx.
"we've got to get headed west for a nav update, john."
"well, ekalv. but this is cnly- this has got those two whatchaca!lems there. 3? $5 28 27 £f,_-eva bt_atyou mean? 06 u_x 28 30 cdr-eva all those - yeah, oks?/. they can't ac in the src %_efe do they go, in the ets? 06 05 28 _; i2,sp-eva oh, no, jn a rock box - in a rock bag somewhere. _.,/_dyon't you put them back here on the one - in mine, john, it's back on the rover here. 06 05 28 44''cdr-eva okay. 06 05 28 l6 l\_-eva back on the rover. 06 05 28 59 _....-__v,a. __he_,e_ you go."
"suit gas diverter, push-cabin."
here's one.
yeah.
"that's affirm. better worded, it would have been maneuver and hold in attitude for moon view, et cetera."
"and, joe, let me verify that the position of the earth and the grid is the important thing and not the angle at which the grid intersects the local vertical. is that correct?"
"mark. i have flow. yes, sir. but - will you watch cabin pressure for me? want me to read those while you guys do the integrity check? okay. let me get up here. you want me to read those things while you - you have both hands -"
"gordy, you didn't listen. i can't see the earth. i'm talking about that other planet."
i guess that sort of depends on what y'all can san about the old platform.
"say, al, if there's any uncertainty as to the deployment area, we'd rather go to a zoom of 100 instead of a zoom of 150; but if you think you've got a good site picked out now, why, we can go to 150."
"okay. 06 03 54 48 i_mp-eva i won't touch it, joe; i swear!"
"hdw's our buddy the redhead doing, houston?"
okay; that would be great.
okay. that's right. you're getting a radial sample. that's fine. i forgot you were doing that.
"how we doing on the time line, houston?"
okay. you're headed out the door. looks real good.
sure is.
"right. power switch on, and watch the film advance as you come on so you can tell us how many degrees."
hold it up.
"no, i don't think i ever went through zero, be- cause i initiated at the sep."
"hey, that's something else. look at that. i wish i had a picture of that. 10 04 19 24 i_p where is it? 10 ok 19 25 cdr right out the center hatch. 10 04 19 28 cml° turn your camera on a minute. turn your camera on a second, al."
"well, that's all right, jack. we'll live with it for a while_ we're looking at - no need to acknowledge this - we're looking at your temperature problem. and there's a couple of obvious things i'm sure you've undertaken, but if you haven't - all the window shades off. get some sunlight in there. and might crank on all the lights to get some more heat load in there. also the - of course, the cabin fan and the temperature - cabin t_mp control thumbwheel - it's your option on that. the other things, like mixing valve adjustment and powering up other items, we're looking at very seriously, but we would like to not do those items until after the eva this morning. we'd like to remain the status quo on the ecs system with the exception of - you do have the cabin fans on your option there. but we would like to re - retain the rest of it status quo until after the eva."
okay. did you hear what i just said about the ecs light aridthe blinking c02 component light?
seems kind of strange ... 03 15 50 38 c_ep i mean that son of a bitch has been out for a long _ime. 03 15 50 _1 i2_p yes.
40 at 3.
"i may have done it again, jim. let me see."
"okay, it's out."
yes.
"okay. and then verb 49 to a p52 attitude, whic_ is 152, 250, 042."
makes it - -
"roger, ed. the ascent bats were on at 103:50:45, and i'll check ed bats now."
"well, thank you very much, sir."
63.
i think dave's imagining all these.
okay.
yes. see - it looks like they progrmmed us for 40-minutes-late lift-off and that's what we have.
yeah.
"understand. t-start, 151:57:14. t-stop, 151:58:27."
"roger, jack."
"yes, i can get it. okay. okay. cml° okay?"
leave it alone.
okay.
"this is houston. say again, please."
that's fine.
you don't think so?
see that? r 06 21 31 33 i_p-eva yes.
"okay, i'm going to slew."
okay. so would we.
"okay. also, we're running out of - there's no time to get 500's either, unfortunately. we're planning on station 4, which will be a better perspective distance anyway."
"also, there's a sequence of different kinds of crater filling on the far side, and i think that, as the orbital stay progresses, we may be able to pin down the relative age relationships and the characteristics of those crater fill - filling episodes. whether they are single episodes that happen in a variety of crater or they're a function of the age and characteristics of the craters in which you find them is not clear right now, but the - they seem to form fairly distinct groupings of crater-fill material."
"without the ball, i still have use of the ttca for control of the - angles."
"what happened to them? you all ready for me to come in, al?"
yes.
"okay. we're ready for another one, then."
"joe, can you see the drill?"
okay. outstanding.
"3.1, is that all?"
"i don't think so, fred. it's several hundred miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number, i'm told. and since the sla panel didn't make the midcourse correction, that might be it. apollo 13 air-to-ground voice transcription psge 72"
"okay, houston, 15; 30 seconds."
"falcon, houston. you're about a minute and 40 sec- onds from los. we'd like to see a 400 plus 30,000 before los."
yes.
that's enough pictures. i'm getting tired of holding that button.
roger. 211.
topping off the plsss right now.
okay. (columbia)
"boy. it just might be permanently shadowed, houston, because - because it's down-slope, and when the - golly -"
yes.
"stand by, columbia."
i wouldn't believe that in a million years.
they've been working. that's for sure.
"i don't want to go in that crater, that's what i don't want to do. okay. we're at 0.6; how about 339 ·· ·"
"aquarius, houston."
"okay; 3, 2, 1 -"
"and, falcon; houston. for your p57, we'd like to use star 5, again, and you should find it in detent 3, at a curser of 184 and a spiral of r- 282."
"okay. well, turn to the left so i can get this other hook."
i say because i sure have not.
okay. we're looking at it.
"okay, houston; 15. out of 40k, and we're showing about a .7, .2, this business now. everybody's in good shape."
".,."
"okay; do you know when you're brushing lcru, we'd like the blankets left at 100 percent rather than 65 percent - we'd like them all left open; and it's been a little warm, also."
"hey, loud and clear."
plus 26.8.
mark cdr.
"that's correct, and you are to start that checklist from the beginning. and at 57 plus 00, you move the csm ptc procedures to completion of our dm battery checkout. and i guess that's an item for al."
you should be able to. be right at the terminator.
"okay. 06 22 15 20 _-eva okay. tony, this big depression off to the left that i was describing is - on the east side, it's a very shallow slope into it, about h er 5 degrees. but, on the far end, the west side and the southwest side , it has very steep walls, 20 degrees of slope - -"
"john, you are just beautiful. that is - that is - the most beautiful sight."
"and it looks like you ought to be getting in your p52 when you get a chance here. cml° yes, i'll get her down here. (humming) can't tell about these geologists. they put on extra maps in your spacecraft and things like that, you know. yes, i get - i gaveyou the last frame number on that romeo romeo, but i think i forgot to tell you the one after the - the other one. oh, by the way, on the other one, agassiz was com- pletely in the darkness and there was no crater rim at all to shine down on agassiz so we didn't get him at all."
"- - each of them has it - that little microswitch; if i release it and do it again, it'll do the same thing."
"third row, ""suit fan (2), open, diverter valve, open, co2 sensor, open. 07 23 29 h3 imp okay."
okay. it's 210/3.4.
"yeah, we sure did."
"excuse me, pete."
i don't see canopus.
"yeah, that's a new first."
"in that depression. bob, you do want the core in a depression, right?"
we copy. thank you.
"yep. did that this morning. i mean, after the first ... what time did they say we get the aos? about -"
"was doing temporary battle with our friend, the trash bag. i have you, visual. tallyho."
"okay. as soon as you can get to it, we'd like you to maneuver to that x-ray pointing attitude that's listed in the flight plan at 245:20. but we do not want you to configure the sim bay. we'll give you that item by item after you get in attitude."
"okay, houston 15. understand you've got enough sim bay data so we'll turn it off. going into ptc and using alfa and delta for damping and bravo and delta for spinup."
... stuff down here.
"hey, tony, i'd like to give you a what i - - 05 08 bo 01 cc go ahead, charlie. 05 08 bo 02 i_p-lm let me say something, tony, here. i'd like to give you what i think - the - the three major areas that we saw today. one, here at the lm, is a - i'm con- vinced is a ray from south ray. the rock types being predominantly frabare [?]. over by flag, we were out of that ray. we were in the cayley, and i sampled on the rim of buster. and whatever made buster, i don't think it was a secondary, because i think +be rocks that we picked up there were true shock rocks. and i just can't see a secondary do- ing that. so the recks around there - we were definitely out of the ray at buster and flag. and also, it's - excuse me. it's buster and spook. at flag and plum, we're again into cayley with hardly any blocks visible. so you have a cayley without the blocks fartherest out. you have the cayley with the blocks that, i th_nk, are some of the stuff that was made from buster on the rim, and then in here towards the lm, we have the south ray."
"the core's in there, isn't it?"
"oh, he is? ... circuit breakers ... that light."
ail righty.
"okay, jack. go ahead with your question."
"charlie, i just barely read you on the forward omni. 04 o0 27'40 lnp okay."
"dave, can you hold up until we clear up the corem, please _."
"tranquility, houston. we'd like your prd read- out, and we have double-checked your t_4dump. it all looks okay. over."
"is that the number 3 section there, geno?"
"we're sort of around 27:30 in the checklist, more or less, and you want the power amp and tm to high?"
"okay, we copy. thank you."
"*** sin in. okay. purge valve in pga, red to red. 04 23 17 57 li_ mine's up about right,"
"spacecraft control, scs."
i'm reading you loud and clear. okay.
that one's for you. here. have at it.... turn around ...
okay.
"roger. copy that clearly, dave, and when you are ready to drive the rover, i've got some words to lay on you about getting those front wheels unstuck."
okay. think we'll use that one there for the optics cal.
okay. go ahead.
"houston, challenger."
we've seen pitch and yaw; we've not seen roll to date.
roger.
roger. 09 06 34 05 imp do you want me to try reacquisition?
"in 3 minutes. john, can you get over there? i got to launch this satellite in 3 minutes."
and do you have this lm dap load for us and tei?
"okay. suit gas converter, pull - egress."
"okay, vance; we've completed that procedure, and let me know if everything was okay."
"houston, 16."
"yep. fire - ascent helium press, fire."
that's okay. it's not going to burn anything tha_ - that ... good. and i don't - -
okay. how about a range and bearing readout.
"he sure must be a longs ways off, because even now he's not very big. you can see his moon, though. that's about all you can tell from it - tell who he is."
how about that.
roger.
mark.
"okay. and, charlie, you can expect the feedwater tone."
"okay, and after the pan camera block, want to add ""v over h override to high altitb_e."""
roger.
you might be able to. it's awful glary though. he'll be well sunlit up there.
roger.
"go ahead, jack."
... comment.
negative.
"do you see it, jack? 05 l/j04 26 cc okay, aquarius; houston. i recommend you termi- nate average g. over."
"seventy-four. 05 13 36 42 _ seventy-four it is, f:ll, 250. okay?"
i don't see a drop anymore.
okay ....
"bob, i see no - no clear alignment of plagioclase or pyroxene in this rock. that's the one with the parting in it. it looks as if - integrating what i've seen here and over at the big rock - the geo- phone rock - i - that the layering or the foliation or the parting, whichever it is, is the result of variations in vesicle concentrations. the sample l0 echo is a sample of the more coarsely vesicular rock. i could not get one of the finer - more finely or nonvesicular fragments. but i got pictures of it."
roger. we copy that.
"okay. i can hear the fan running. oh, man, whew!"
"looking good at aminute. hey, jim, at pitchover, do you want me to go aft omni or stay forward?"
"okay, do you have any feeling - do you have that hard layer underneath there like you did yester- day, when you raked at station 1, jack?"
"al, the computer is yours; you've got a state vector, a target, and a refsmmat."
"there's no light in there. i don't know if there was ever supposed to be, but there isn't."
"roger. dave, we're reading you loud and clear."
"yes, the locator is really all you need; but a partial pan to show the area would be appreciated."
okay.
"where are you, al?"
i - you're going to have to get further down. f i can't reach you.
okay. let me go to f/ll.
it 's sort of pointing west.
"i stand corrected. what they really wantea was to bring al's camera back, instead of yours; so, we'll only be bringing the one camera, the cdr's. 05 15 07 29 i2_' okay, houston. 05 15 07 35 cd_ excuse me just a minute. 05 15 08 01 lm_ right. right. fredo, correct me, now; m_g kilo-kilo has never been used. isn't that correct?"
"roger. we won't be able to see it to keep track of the times, remember, al. and, also i guess the mass spec people would appreciate any more comments you can think of. next time you take a look at those particles at sunrise. over."
you can't do it - ... you really can't.
"thank you, gene."
okay. on the way.
"negative, negative."
"that's only half of it. we have most of it hidden away. it's been pretty interesting doing all the camera work here to get a little extra training running the tv here, hopefully for when we get on the ground at fra mauro. the monitor does make it pretty easy though."
"okay, let me turn around."
"okay, fred. it's just beginning to cut off at the bottom, but it's still a very good picture."
"i don't know, charlie. 05 20 26 26 i/4p-lm i can't remember where that comes in the flight plan. i think it's right at 130 hours."
"okay. we're going to take an outside view now, out the left side, joe."
could that be it?
"lock her, dave. you can ..."
...
you did? cdr-t_m yes.
that one right there.
"but we'll look for a rock that's glass-coated, tony."
"houston, how does the cabin look to you?"
"it turned out pretty good, i think."
"i'll tell you, you might take a look at the old lm. she sure does a good job - landing in this kind of terrain."
okay.
thank you. and verify your transponder off.
"okay, here we go. 1, 2, 3, - oop! i got ahold of it. and a bunch of ... going out there. (laughter) lost the - oh, there goes the pen. yes, ... (laughter) okay. it was a felt-tip pen. no scissors. (laughter)"
excellent. 03 10 49 -- begin lunar rev 3
"oh, there you are. this is much better. how is this?"
okay.
okay. let me come up to the hill there. i got the picture.
"okay, burn time's going to be about 18 or 19, 07:18 or 07:19, jack. l_-lm okay."
roger.
it's pretty reasonable by comparison.
are you there?
good show. that's the way it should go. now we'd like you to turn around and look at the cosmic ray for a second.
i'm staying in p22 here a second just to record (tranq) the noun 89 and then over verb 34.
"roger. that's verb 46. roger. aquarius, houston."
"careful, guys ·"
"okay, it seems to be locked now, tony. i don't know what happened - it just - i pushed on it back at the lm but it - -"
it's going to be one of those high - high - angle energy conversion roundouts.
"gordy, the null bias check. plus 0.9 and 100 seconds."
okay.
and_ charlie; understand you got the muley rock and put it in the big rock bag?
"i wouldn't consider it low, ken; it's climbing right back up."
"the - okay. the light material - light-colored flow material - around the edges of the - of the basin - texture appear to be nothing more than just simple mass wasting off of the edges - or off the - off of the rims around the basin. the rims themselves are quite - cut with the mass wasting in a - oh, i'd say an extent of about 330 degrees on the north, east, and south sides. now, on the west side, the rim there is a very, very, large, clean scarp; and when i say clean, it goes almost from the basin floor to the - to the rim itself in one large chunk. and that scarp appears to define the limits of a couple of fault zones that go through that rim of tsiolkovsky. it was kind - it - i couldn't trace the fault zones beyond tsiolkovsky from the vantage point i had very well, tape93/52 but they're very distinct in the wall itself. and one falt zone coincides or - occurs in the same location as the su - southernmost edge of what ap- pears to be a rock glacier extending northwest into fermi_?_. now, that rock glacier has all the flow- bending and the - and the loping toes characteristic of what we consider a rock slide; however, one - one - feature about that slide that i mentioned before is that it has what looks like fairly fresh crater imp - impacts on the slide itself and seems to have more impacts - in other words, a higher density of craters - than the - than the surround- ing floor of fermi, although fermi looks - the floor looks much older - it's much smoother, more like a cayly formation."
"roger, pete."
"that's fine, deke. thank you very much. and we appreciate those kind words."
will do.
"those frames that ron mentioned - this is jack - that he mentioned were taken of a area where there's a much lighter gray albedo. rather than the tannish gray, it's pure gray material that generally is on the rim crest of a number of craters. it may be related to the swirls that we see elsewhere."
*** take this one.
what's your range? i'm ready to go to ... attitude.
"oh, yes, yes, yes, yes."
tried that before. it worked on the ground. you know something?
"water flag, a."
"ken, in regard to that davy thing - i was just talking to spence and he says that the - that was the correct time and that - that - where they call officially the terminator. and the photo setting should have worked. but it sounds like from what you said, it may have been a little too dark."
"okay. and, al, one question. did you get the sesc sample out of the bottom of the trench? 05 14 35 k7 cdr well, i told you the trench was kind of a miserable failure, because the walls kept falling down. and i could get a sample from the bottom, but it wouldn't be the bottom, i'm afraid."
"and, endeavour. we'd like auto and high gain, please."
"master arm's on. two lights, houston."
"stand by, hadley base."
really? ... 07 10 18 ll c_p it's really been grim as far as that kind of stuff.
"*** like to get off the plss water and get some spacecraft water, too?"
... time skip
"whoops, oh, yes; i got some soil."
"houston, 16. time skip"
roger.
"and, john, do you have a bag number for your white rock, or have you collected it yet?"
yeah.
"okay, i'm cracking the hatch now."
roger. stand by. we'll have an aaswer.
"okay, dave. i think you can get in now."
"okay. sounds good. volts, 39.1; amps, 1.3."
"you know, i can't get down to you."
"yes, i have to go back the way i was."
"okay. and do you have any estimate, vance, on how long we'll be charging battery b?"
"okay, now i need no special techniques to do this."
"..., how about radiators, water ... and all those - -"
"go ahead, ed."
no; it's fine.
"apollo ll, this is houston. over."
"roger, mike. we'd like to see you go _o accel core,and on the manual attitude switches. then to turn on the auto rcs select switches, and then go rate command. that mill prevel_t us from firing jets uncoupled. over. 01 08 33 36 cml° okay. fine. and i would guess go rate command and roll first and then followed by pizch and yaw. o1 08 33 '_5 cc okay. that sounds good if - and when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go rate command at that time and it'll stop us right on."

"okay, let's get that tv out and show e _rybody. wait a minute. lock inner mast; lock cuter mast; extend and lock brakes - we've done; s_[gn; remove thermal cover. okay? we want thermal cover."
yes. it was a very quiet night. down here the old black team is complaining they didn't get a chance to make any transmissions. ron evans is getting --
"okay. thank you. it's no big deal, dave, nothing to worry about."
"okay, the tcu is locked in. 04 09 t9 3_ lmp-eva houston, i've seen an awful lot of rocks, as i worked here. they look just like those pyroxene gabbros that i mentioned. the pyroxene's irri- descent in the bright sun. the grain size is about - oh, between - maybe the mean is 2 milli- meters with max maybe up at 3 or 4. and it looks like predominantly a pyroxene plagioclase rock - elinopyroxene, but i haven't looked at it real closely."
that's what it s_s. i don't know.
"okay, yours is closed?"
"okay. block population is unchanged; still appears to be the - when i can see large enough blocks - appears to be the gabbro, although there's not as - not as much to look at now in terms of blocks. the surface characteristics have not changed. there are no craters that we see that are bringing up clear, blocky rims. there's a - most of the fresh craters have incident rock around them. the craters are the same size. they are older and more s_dued. that incident rock is apparently broken down. i suspect a small zapping breaks that down fairly quickly."
i mean down. she looks good. now if i remember right -

here's your helmet. keeps - or is that my helmet? i think we've lost track of helmets.

"you'd swear that - sure thing. you'd swear that you ought to be able to see the i_ with these binoculars. i think if you knew where to look _-_ exactly, you might be able to see it. but you couldn't hold anything in your hand any more sensi- tive. i'll tell you, the cinco craters stand out very nicely and the crest crater is very obvious from up here. but it looks like the path you've drawn that goes from station 5 to 6 and 4 - that path looks to me like it runs down sort of a tongue of material. that you can drive up it - and that those white lines we've got drawn on chart 9 charlie - really aren't obvious at all. when you get over around more in the south ray side you start to see these things, but it's just not at all obvious that they're going to see any- thing - down that path."
... i knew ...
"i was afraid of that. okay. and for charlie there, we'd like to verify that on the third eva when he was driving out to station 11 with the polarizer on, that he used nominal camera settings. he didn't allow for the polarizer."
"i wouldn't have ..., if i was ..."
i'm hoping to get out of *** water. (laughter)
dead band is min.
stick the purse in here.
"okay. yeah, i can stuff them in here. let me get these core tube caps out of here. out of sxe and put them under the .. pin. okay. i put them on the htc, how would that be? c[ 05 31 58 cdr-eva that's fine, that midcap is empty. ct 05 32 oh cc okay, charlie, you called out that you put two core tubes and john's crystalline rocks in scb 3_ that should have some empty core tubes and core caps in it. could you straighten that out? 06 'i,_32 18 l_-eva no, we - it had two core tubes emptied and we ussd - we used the bag, tony, _shat's true - 0{ 0_ 32 27 cdr-eva hold it, charlie. 06 05 32 28 ii_2-eva excuse me, john. that was set - -"

"i think everybody's feeling better down here, too,"
"okay. that's pretty smart, charlie."
"ail right, dick. you're - we're still in secondary servo's there. you might go back to primary ones."
"right now, you mean?"
"the only thing that i didn't recognize vas - there vas a little ripple of pogo that kind of built up and died out to - to - to about 09:07 in the s-ii burn, and then it quit at- and then after - after the engine shut down, i felt a little pogo."
there's that word again. the ancillary stowage container.
i think i could probably tape the camera somewhere so it would have a - a view approximately the same as what we've been seeing.
mark; gene. just a spot flash in the bottom of the left eye.
"hey, hank. hey, hank. have you got two loops punched up? have you got two loops punched up? the noise is getting louder and louder. it sounds like i got - i'm trying to listen to you over a football game. and i can hardly hear you over the din of everything else. i don't know whether you need to hold the mike closer to your mouth, or whether you got another loop punched up and i'm getting crossfeed."
... right-hand ...
okay.

"looks good. oh, i'm sorry. it's not him - it is not he. thought he was moving, but he's not - just - don't see him at all."
"hey, that sounds real interesting, ken."

yes. where is the tape? anybody know?
"0k_y, jim. sounds good."

"well, you haven't smelled t® much urine, have you?"
"dave, would you turn m_ ... valve, please?"
okay.
"it appears that that pipa's responding to tempera- ture changes, is what the problem is, john."
"look down there at 12:30. it looks like the block's there, almost in position."
"okay_ okay, that big mamou is locked. i got a lot of oxygen. i still got 22 percent."

okay. are you beautifull iafp what's wrong with my camera now?
"okay, one last little check is optics power is on. we'd like it off eventually. i expect you haven't gotten that far yet, al."
i've got almost - okay. and then work towards the -
i knew they would.

"okay, there is a special request. rather than grab samples at the north crater rim there_ they'd like to get a documented sample of a partially buried rock."
"15, this is houston."
"6.50 d_'gt...s... and, jim, houston. i guess, as a last il,r,r,w,e expect that it will take us about an hour to update your checklist and your tim,?lines sometime later on today, and we'd just like you to consider that. i expect it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that stuff ready."
and the question is how hard is that? what's its ...? i don't know.
standby.
"open, dave?"
"well, we might need a trash bag, john."
okay.
okay .... want? 61 ... 63?
"okay, translunar, inject, verify?"
he's coming to us on b.
"that's what it looks like from here, jack. it's pretty much the opposite of the lm activation procedure where we do the dock coarse aline."
okay. call me when you get your minute.
"roger, ron."
dead on it - right on the side of the roll.
"okay, that looks good here. 04 11 49 19 lmp-i_{ okay, tony, we'd like to thank everybody for the great job of regrouping, and getting back to what seems to be pretty nominal from now on; and we'll see you in the morning. i guess you can give us a reveille call over the squawk box here. over."

"okay. to show that our good postal service has deliveries any place in the universe, i have the pleasant task of canceling here on the moon, the first stamp of a new issue dedicated to commemorate united states achievements in space. and i'm sure a lot of people have seen pictures of the stamp. i have the first one here on an envelope, at the bottom it says, ""united states in space, a decade of achievement,"" and i'm very proud to have the opportunity here to play postman. i pull out a cancellation device. cancel this stamp. there's august the second, 1971, first day of issue. what could be a better place to cancel this stamp than right here at hadley rille."
"okay. now, 13, request you either move it away from the bright area or else move it back to peak. over."
okay. i'm on the audio panel that gene was on when he first transmitted.

roger.
"roger. if possible, we'd like for you to lift up that door and inspect the clearance between the hinge and the top of the mapping camera, and look for any scrape marks on the camera or on the door and any evidence of twisting or bending of the stellar lens glare shield."
"8.65 by 50.9. 05 22 17 14 l_ _ okay. i've got 50.3 by 4 - let's see, 403; _.k, so that's - we're right together, al. t confide i,"
we'll get it to you. yes. let's get soil in this bag.
everything looks good.
"okay. on your right side. okay, i 'got it, and it's moving in - looks like a combination now. it's moving, though; it's oscillating at this time."
"okay, casper; this is houston. we're recommending that you null the line-of-sight rates and fire 5 feet per second toward the lm."
roger. we copy.
"okay. taking the picture of _he met tracks, houston. with the closeup and the sun angle's - -"
"and as near as i can figure, tony, what we've got to do now is load up the plsss and go get them. want me to reset the fa_ uv again, or you just want to be happy with this? we - all we got to do now is a piss loadup."
"i thought we had another ... - - 06 23 10 54 cml° ... to the attitude, pete ...."
"okay. stand by. 02 16 07 33 cml= okay, jack. is this a long one?"

i'm sorry. i want it in normal for 30 seconds.
that's all correct. thank you. and the last bit of information i have down here is a mapping camera photo pad. at 214 plus - -
"oh, man; yes. i can see what you're talking about now. lt_p-e%_a look over by hanover. cdr-_fa it looks like the scarp overlays the north massif, doesn't it?"
"15, this is houston. we'd like to have you go wide beam on the high gain antenna, and then to narrow."
i'ts really good. that saved us a lot of time.
"and %he cauzion, of course - not mere than i_0 ox the aps."

affirmative.
okay. that's it.
"okay. now, after we get down to - after the p61 entry prep and prior to entering p61, we want to add - and the - what we're doing here, ken, is we're resetting the average-g flag, which we set in 509. and if we do not do this step - now this is a - a pretty critical step - if we do not reset that average-g flag, p61 will not call average g. so our procedure here before we go into p61 is a verb 25 noun 7 enter, 75 enter, 1 enter, enter. and if for some reason p61 would not call up average g, your fastest and most obvious cue is that lack of the comp cycle before noun 61 comes up. if you don't reset this, your noun 61 comes up immediately, but - with 509 running, we've got to get this step in or we'll not pick up our average g."
"okay. and this time you want to do a pulse torque, p52, option 1, at 46."
that's affirm.
okay.
"yes, sir; they're open. oh, what a nice little machine. *** little downslope, but at the heading you want, and i guess ed's satisfied with the tv response, huh?"

"okay, you're - it's partially covering the rover, but i think it's a pretty good shot. how's that? let me get the focus right. ,"
what about station 3?
we don't get to bring our acas back.
roger. 0.9.
look at - -
"okay. you understand that? secure cable - and that's the same one, the comm cables - to tv bracket - top of strut using two straps. you got that?"
... back here and see if i can bump into it.
mark it. i still have no mtvc. i'm bringing on the pitch 2 gimbal -
i can't! there's no way. 07 22 36 25 imp ...
yes.
"well, i think the one you're referring to was what we felt was almost entirely plagioclase or --_ perhaps anorthocite. and it was a small fragment sitting on top of a - a dark brown larger frag- ment, almost like on a pedestal. and jim and i were both quite impressed with the fact that it - it was there, apparently waiting for us. and we had hoped to find more of it, and, i'm sure, had we more time at that site, that we would have been able to find more. but i think this one rock, if it is, in fact, the beginning of the moon, will tell us an awful lot. and we'll leave it up to the experts to analyze it when we get back, to determine its origin."
copy that.
okay. it's a frothy - glass agglutinate is going to be in bag 481.
roger.
"yes. bob mercer. 01 08 18 b1 cmp oh, yes."

okay. i am jets.
"okay, karl. go ahead with the tei-37."
"well, you could call up a star."
"charlie, this camera here is kind of dusty."
"jack, could you get his - his flap on the other side?"
"okay, houston. would you like to take over our clock?"
"the other one is located at 7 - the other one columbia) is located at 7.2, two-thirds of the way from mike to nan."
okay.
"not quite,"
"yes.... let's see, i'm going to start getting up around ..."

i'll go to b.
"okay, jack. how do you read now?"
okay. and we're thir_king that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. and i think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... dcuble that. i guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. over.

it's kind of the way they said it was going to be.
"apollo 11, houston. one minute to log."
okay.
can you hold it?
something smells terrible in here. you notice that ?
you out completely?
_d the transmitter's going on.
"okay, bat's at volts and amps."
roger.
"how's the time, bob?"
"mark. barber pole, and it's gray. okay. going to the mass spectrometer. deploy."
i'm 3.75. 0_ 11 29 59 cdr mark it.
"well, it looks to me like either the direction you're headed is good or the one a little bit more to the right. you're going to - you're going to have to go far enough so we don't end up in one of the craters when we start to ... deploy."
huh?
"that solves that one. ail right. that's one. 05 15 07 53 _p yes, it is."
"one, 2, 3, 4, 5. this is a test of the recorder. over. 07 03 01 08 cmp* this tape will be used for the solar -"
"got it. that sure is a super little platform, isn't it?"
"yes, it was way back in there."
"okay, that - this can change to the integration as you come around."
"i tell you, hank, i think that the terminator got hung up here on a high mountain or something. it doesn't look like it's moving as much as it is everywhere else on the moon."
"okay. the preliminary look here - we think it's a hardware problems ken. some sort of a transient problem, and when we get the data in here, we'll be able to tell a little more about it."
gingerbread?
okay. copy that.
roger. they're looking here - looking good. lnp sure felt like it. i think we saw them all from here.
who's sitting on your right tonight?
"yeah. 04 00 53 39 _mp okay, let's go. push your breakers in."
"stand by; i'll verify it, jim."
- - motion.
- - and then i'll finish it up for you.
see you later.
"okay, thank you."
"i just got another uplink too fast when i took the data switch back off - it's happening, i guess, about a third of the time."
"okay. panel ll, close suit fan circuit breaker, and we'll get the suit fan cranked up."
"15, this is houston. sorry to tell you, but i made a couple of errors in that read-up. can we make it two corrections?"
roger. understand. you - -
"and off, lefts hi. 04 22 47 33 _mp off."
copy 39.0 and 1.75.
okay. i got those deletions. go ahead.
see those glass fractures that - -
it's probably because the power's ...
roger.
why don't you snap it right there? that's where i figured it'd go.
"okay. henry, how do you read on the high gain?"
yes.
why now?
okay.
thc is - - 01 06 34 22 cmp/cdr going clockwise -
"the next item here is to take the mapping camera to the standby mode, and i assume i should do that before i turn the - sm/ac power off."
"well, i'm getting them now."
okay. stay where you are. i'm going to get mine. okay. audio breaker is -
just wanted to get a systems check from you (columbia sometime prior to los.
"yeah, i think it might be a rock surface, and we're just in its ... friable ones, the fractured ones, and we're just chipping off - here, john, i can get a soil sample from where you kicked it up with your foot. oh, boy."
"pro. okay, verb 21 - - 04 00 56 0b cdr enter. 04 00 56 05 _ - - enter; 2bb enter; pro. okay, pro. hey, that thing really takes off, doesn't it? (laughter) 04 00 56 t5 cdr knows what it's doing. 04 o0 56 17 i_myp huh? man, look at that - oh, there's old casper out there. isn't he pretty? 04 00 56 38 _fp okay."
okay. we're stabilizing. you want me to go to boost/en - -
hang on. we're going way out of plane. 04 12 50 38 _ that's right. that's where we're supposed to go.
"45 minutes, perilune altitude checks, rendezvous radar, cb, for the 99th time, they're both open (laughter). onfidenttal"
roger. out.
that's the antares.
"okay, joe. let me give it back to you and see if i've got it here. after the p52, during our ptc you want us to use p52 and observe bennett's comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if we can find it visible. it would be visible somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75 degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll, and if we do see it, make an observation of whether it is photographable, note the roll angle for photographs to be taken after or prior to initiation of ptc at 56:30. tape31/8"
this is the best friday afternoon matinee i've ever been to.
mark.
"s-ivb tank pressure is about 32, coming down. the oxidizer at about 28, coming down on the fuel."
"we have a data drop on right now, jim; we'll look at it as soon as it comes up."
"yes, that's what they said."
we're trying. the i and 2 heaters will be in auto and 3 fan will be in auto.
"yes, yes - well, there's no - no - if you want to take a color picture, they - what they want is a color picture to back up the scene you're seeing in the uv. so, if you can't get a color picture of that area, there's no sense taking it. but you might go ahead and take some pictures with the 80 millimeter. there's nothing wrong with that. on the - °.."
"dave, we read all that. we're getting a beautiful picture now. we're going to try to wind up with the tripod in the shade, if that's possible, looking back towards the lm. 'rape78/18"
...
yes; that mess you up?
okay.
"roger. on our down-link data, we see indications of high gain antenna yaw fluctuations. wonder if you could glance over at your onboard indication and see if you see it there as well. and, also we're standing by for crew status reports, when you're ready to give it. 08 o1 21 b1 cdr no, we - we see no oscillations up here, joe. 08 01 21 b4 cc okay, thank you. 08 o1 22 b8 cc al, this is houston. with a tei-62 pad, when you're ready for that. we also have a question. how did the mass spec boom retraction go? and we've got a switch setting for your mass spec when you're ready."
"yeah, you're 4200 out. it says here it -"
"roger; we saw it, and fao's working on it."
how about let me use the center window for a second?
60 - 62 - 3 -
"in answer to number 6, the answer is essentially no. we saw no venting or suspected leak on the lm or the csm ..."
"yeah, we don't even -"
"roger. we'll pass that along, mike."
"arm is closed. o0 04 14 19 imp okay. cue msfn, because we'll be getting the logics on the arm pretty soon."
"boy, the view of stone mountain, tony, is superb. look at that hole we almost landed in."
okay; you have omni charlie.
okay.
"vhy a, t/r; b, receive."
"okay, i'll do that. 12 06 27 42 i24p houston, this is apollo 15 on simplex a."
roger; copy.
"okay. direct 02's on, the cabin's coming up now."
"the old acc_unulator cycle again_ i guess, gang."
okay. let me picture this here where my big foot went.
you've got it. the coas goes in the overhead window. the stungot in my - -
"hey, mr. sic! congratulations on a super job all the way. sure appreciate it."
"oh, that's great."
our repress package pressure is 820.
"i think that s_,m_up the day. it's a day of anticipation for what's going to happen tomorrow. everything's gone off real well here, and we're just glad you're in the orbit you're in and ready for tomorrow."
"bob, are you reading?"
"it's probably behind h, isn't it."
"that's correct, and sm rcs heater b main a, open, and heater d main a, open. over."
yes. do it while you're facing that way. just hang them up. got time to do it. ail you've got is water.
"it's kind of nice having some room down here, isn't it?"
and i don't fully understand that one. never have.
loud ... - -
about 40 meters.
"yeah, i got it."
red to red and blue to blue.
"yes, you know we did that in the sim - got fouled up on that, too."
no.
yeah - -
"thought we were just supposed to leave it there. 06 02 4b 03 cdr okay, i'll have regular gloves to stow to go over, al."
"check on that, jack. just a minute."
"... and count. yeah, before we started on that, we decided to take a look at 16 20 and it seems to be counting in all three axes, and they agree with what's on the fdai."
how do pressures look?
okay - -
down below. you want it?
"yes. i got it. 06 02 59 25 i_mp now, i need my scissors which are right here. yes. boy, we got it made ...."
"roger, 14. cut-off. 00 02 34 33 cn_ and tanks are venting down. the oxidizer is coming do_n through 35 now. the fuel is coming down through 30. 00 02 32 _1 imp okay, al. scs tvc - -"
"we can now, i think, see contrast down in the shadow. and the only part of the scarp that is visible - i think jack picked it out - as being right where lara is."
"okay, houston, this is ed. i'm at the end of my geophone line. looking back over it, i see that the cable has knocked down the second flag. do you want me to go back and look at it, or shall we try one shot and see if everythings working?"
"i'm not sure that this isn't such an old crater, that the secondary - that the secondaries aren't eroded down. we've really got good going right here."
"roger. you got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. skip over to surface-61 down there at tig minus 17."
what do you have to do on this rcs?
"15, houston."
"hit it, charlie. i got the pictures. i really *** that's right near the shatter cone. ha, ha. 06 23 45 47 iai-eva yeah."
i'll pull myself in.
"houston, do you hear that?"
"well, i ..."
yes. your head's full. you feel like you've been on your feet all day. 00 02 40 52 i24p that's what i feel like; i feel like i'm kind of - -
"and what are the new settings, houston?"
that makes a pretty good tv picture standing up there. the big eye is on you.
"endeavour, this is houston. how do you read? and we seem to have a small coremproblem. please stand by."
... 03 08 59 46 c_p yeah.
"okay, houston. nominal burn; first - first doi burn we ever had that was nominal."
"()kay, i'm doing a routine check on the tunnel. 03 23 52 39 t2_p ()kay, that's - that's what we need - need."
- - very fine phenocrysts.
"roger. clv_o bob, i expect he'll probably be able to see the lights of silver city, too. well, i'm sure going to be looking for them, i'll tell you."
"_11 righty. thank you, sir."
"okay. we'll give you a hack, bob."
okay. you mean delete preamp.
m__rk.
okay. i've got everything on in my auto panel. let me try the other one for backup.
roger.
don't - don't ... (laughter).
"jim, could you give us a little help on the tilt, we seem to be hung up."
2:21.
"15, this is houston."
"houston, the water accumulator is right on (eagle) the line between the red and the green. over."
hope you can get your feet in there.
okay. you got a bag?
"okay. there's one a couple of inches. most of them are an inch or so or smaller. they're angular to suorounded fragments. *** look like the inclusions. as a matter of fact, the ones that are broken open look like some of the light-colored inclusions we saw in the big boulder. the others are too dust ~ covered to say anything about."
i can't believe it but i got her.
"okay, we copy."
pro. let me ***
okay. magazine golf is going on at frame count 2.
etb has two cameras.
yes.
"roger. you're seeing earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little mo_e than a half earth. we're looking at the eastern pacific ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see north america, alasxa, united states, canada, mexico, and central america. south america becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. we can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the w_stern u.s., san joaquin valley, the sierra mountaia range, the peninsula of baja california, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastera u.s. there's one definite mild storm southwest of alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or mcre south latitude. can pick out the browns in the land- forms pretty well. greens do not shot up very well. some greens showing along the north- eastern - northwestern coast of the united states and northwestern coast of canada."
okay. it's on.
certainly less than 1.
good.
"okay. let's see, the other thing is the - oxygen and cryo - oxygen tank b and hydrogen tank 3 sit right on top of the service module door. so that's a good thing to be monitoring."
"stand by. i think 8 went in; either 4 or 6. no, excuse me; either 5 or 4."
"yeah, i - i can believe that."
"okay, we copy."
"yeah. hey, let me take it easy now. i'm pooped."
"it's fast, isn't it?"
"oh, my. let me try it this way."
"okay. i don't care. i've started down, jack."
"roger, pete. i sent you bum dope. !1 did not use their heaters."
it's awful soft in here; watch it.
"fsrward cabin dump valve, open, then auto at 4-1/2. 03 23 54 59 imp okay."
"roger. we are copying it - cabin temp around 70. is it a little more comfortable? c_o well, we got two extremes."
"that's rear steering. circuit breakers are in, drive power's on delta, and steering's on delta."
"roger, ron."
you sound like you're in the next room.
it's open all the way. we're going to have to movembuzz _o_d _ little bit.
pgns and ags are looking good.
"i think that has to be worked out when we've looked at all the data - on the ground and discuss it with the flight controllers. at the present time, i have no idea."
"got the lanyard low - stowed. o0 00 26 58 _ okay. drinking water supply valve, on."
"yes, ..."
"hello, apollo 11, houston. the rates are damped out well enough for you to initiate the ptc now. over."
"okay, jack. i got two commander fdai breakers in, ac and dc, and the two gasta breakers in ac and dc and next you'll want the rcs heaters all on with the - pressurize the rcs and then the main sovs open. and i think they're already open."
"it's been a long day. _md did you copy those circuit breakers, charlie?"
"yes, we sure are. we've got a good picture of the skipper there."
"yes. it might be a slump block, or scmething - like that. cdr_eva jack, i'm going to go to the left."
that's off.
roger. understand service module venting has ceased momentarily. how about the descent stage? does fred report venting down there? do you still see that?
"_'_kav.._a,nd we're all waitlnz with hate,i i_re:,th to einj cdt what time _rcu end salt donnin_s. -_7 21 53 !o cmp 20d:25. 07 21 5{ 35 cc i _suess jus_ when %he {n_ i en,:i. i - l_-,'.'- let's lock here at the nex¥ csl'_r.n, 1i3:_.1. l)e!ete - - _ 53 hl hs ' ,:_%h_er) ... disccur;-u_irts."

"hello, apollo 11. houston. could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the lm back up? over."
"okay, copy that, geno."
roger. ready to copy.
"charlie, when you get a chance, we need your 554 through 6 read-outs. i see you got them now."
"okay, dave and jim; houston with a comm check. do you read? over."
okay. you have the dsky now.
okay. we copy.
okay; you have high bit rate. you hear that noise?
"yes, we're okay. ail we've got is a switch to throw on this lm power. okay. after the suit, next thing we've got is a switch to throw, and i can do that. that's 13 minutes from now. and the next thing after that - what's that?"
we still don't have - the craters at about 10 to 15 meters in diameter seem to have somewhat more blocky material in their rims. but they're not clearcut blocky rim craters. and here's one that's probably 50 meters across that has a - a fair num- ber of blocks in the bottom. looks like it might have just about gotten down to where the gabbro is - starts to be abundant again.
"okay, gordo. thank you. got you."
okay. copy that.
beautiful.
that's affirmative.
"what do you mean, are we all for it? (laughter)"
"there, you got it?"
"in living color. 05 05 i6 27 cdr-eva okay, joe. j-5 on the first probe."
"what 's wrong? i2_p-eva well, it's just about impossible. bob, it looks like the probes are going to be in a shallow de- pression. i'll try to improve that a little. it's not a real crater - it's just a shallow depres sion."
okay. everybody's looking at that now. we're trying to psych out what's going wrong here.
... go.
"now get your valves, d. they look good."
"and, pete, i'll tell you, that cabin pressure relief valve - i mean the cabin repress valve in the lm will really give you apoplexy, boy!"
i wonder what the good boss is going to go do? he must have a - i would think running - running aspo would be enough of a - of a challenge to be worth staying around for. he must have an awfully good job offer.
we're passing the 40-seconds mark. that might have been a second or 2 behind. 00 02 34 25 cdr/cmp pu shift.
roger.
(laughter)
... down; looking great. looking good.
"hey, mighty fine. sounds good."
"man, that's hot. feel that. i_mp-lm out in the sun. cdr-i_m yes."
"go ahead, joe."
...
"falcon, houston. your vent's complete. you can terminate."
...
317
another big one right back here ...
"apollo 16, houston. we want to still keep working on this sps gaging problem. we'd like to get a readout if we could on your sps fuel and oxidizer pressures."
okay; hop on.
"mark. mark. a - one- the first one was right eye, a streak going from inboard center to the upper right. left one was a streak, pencil shaped - a pencil line, left eye from center to upper right."
that's affirm.
"i found out that, looking out the window out there, that the - we'd be able to see it a lot better. and i guess with the telescope that they've got that ..."
"okay - the circuit breakers are verified. now - _-_ okay, now, we got to hook up some water."
"yes, and there she came. i saw it."
"well, here; i'll hold this. i can read it to you."
"endeavour, a news bulletin from the surface says that they are now depressing the cabin; and there is no need for you to acknowledge. keep eating."
okay.
"roger, 11."
okay. how much - how much sleep from the time when we start to bed do you want us to get?
thank you.
think we do.
(laughter) ohhl
uh-huh.
"well, i guess ... i've been on - lmp's back to minimum."
"apollo 16, houston. 08 01 43 21 c_ hello, henry. glad to have you back."
"(laughter) if the boss says that, i agree with him; yes, sir."
okay. i just looked at them.
"yes, but this is so much ... anyway."
okay.
... get the snap.
"no, it hasn't changed any."
"he ..., huh?"
"okay. you want that battery backout procedure now to take that - to complete the remaining steps? 05 08 ]5 50 cc that's affirm, jack. we request that you go ahead and finish out the backout completely until you get to square 1. over."
there it goes to reacq.
"well, gentlemen, i'll break out my two gold pens."
that's affirm. we got all the breakers pulled again.
"i took three quick pictures of triple craters, houston."
*** plss data looks good down here. · cdr yes. there's the tone. therels a press flag and a vent flag.
"then when you all get down in the leb, get that waste storage vent valve closed. 00 02 58 40 cmp/lv_p yes ... time skip"
"geno, i'll read you the pao release; they s,,mmed up pretty well, and i'll just use their words here. the time has been made up in two increments. the first one of i hour and 45 minutes in the flight plan. the crew activities were jumped ahead by i hour, and they essentially began doing those things that were called for i hour later in the flight plan. they will again jump ahead an hour and 40 minutes, and that will occur at 65 hours. by that time they will have completed all those activities required up through 67 hours and 40 min- utes in the flight plan. or, in other words, they will have completed all the activities required to get them into lunar orbit 2 hours and 40 minutes early, and in order to make the clocks then agree with where the crew will be in the flight plan, we'll jump the clocks ahead 2 hours and 40 minutes. this clock update, which can be likened to going on daylight savingtime, only 2 hours and 40 min- utes worth of change instead of i hour of change as we do on daylight saving time, will occur at 65 hours when the crew will have completed all of those flight plan activities up through 67 hours and 40 minutes. (chuckle) this simply involves setting our ciock to65 hours in the control center and aboard the spacecraft to 65 hours, moving them ahead to 67 hours and 40 minutes. then, barring any further changes in the mission time line, from that point on, the elapsed time clocks, which are used as a cue to flight plan activities, should agree with the flight plan and events that, in the flight plan are called out for a certain time will happen at that time on the elapsed time clocks (laughter) in mission control and aboard the space- craft. (laughter) this is a convenience factor."
yes.
"roger. age c nfidenti';jjli 5 0h 18 42 31 cc at 01:30, 20 feet."
that's correct.
okay. go.
stay away from the cable.
understand.
"- - no, i can see. let me - just come over here by the ladder."
"okay. and we have a good picture there, geno. thank you."
roger. we're happy with those demand regs now. and you can proceed on with that and includinz all the - the - the plss recharges that you'll need to do as well.
roger.

roger. i can't see them. (columbia)
"hey, there's an icicle hanging off that dump."
"the whole thing is going to fracture off here, in a minute."
"... 40 on the ems, is that right?"
okay. stand by and i'll get - go ahead.
yes.
make sure the ground doesn't want to try it either.
"roger. let's go on with the circuit breaker panel checkout. 02 12 34 34 [mp okay. i'll just give you - i think it'll be easier to give you what i got in. okay, in the top row on 11, we have the four ac bus tie breakers in and the ac bus volts breaker in, and that's it. second row, we have the four tca breakers in. we have the gasta under flight displays and commander's fdai. and likewise under ac bus a, we have a gasta and a commander fdai breaker in. that's it. on row 3, we have a signal conditioner 1. we have the atca (pgns). we have the engine control breaker, attitude direct control breaker, and the - under lighting, anun/dock/component breaker in. and one other, ed logic power a - ed logic power a is also in."

got about 50 seconds. 05 06 31 25 dmp-lm thank you.
okay.
i see - you see those rcs flash; there's another one.
okay; it's running.
how far did it look like it went before it jsi_ned?
"if you'll gi_e me kind of a call at what you're aiming at_ like picard x and picard, i can give you a call on those f_stops_ rono"
"okay; if they're in the vicinity, it might be a nice idea - -"
"i'm getting to like driving this machine. okay, pull pin 2. pin 2 always comes after - goes before pin 1."
and endeavour roger. thank you. 04 05 45 -- begin lunar rev 13
"we're just two little - two little sets of twinkle- toes here. there's a lot that goes to getting this rover running out here *** don't have much to do with. and i guess there might be someone else that has something to do with it, too, and i've been reading his signs, maybe not from him directly, but his in spirit, as we run up and down that ladder. and that's godspeed the crew of apollo 17. and if he's listening, i'd like to thank him, too. pin i is pulled. *** the end of the west sep antenna. do you agree with that?"
"intrepid, houston. you were off on that figure by 20 seconds. csm was right. 04 12 2_ 47 cdr yes. i had the wrong time. he's burning now, and he looks good out there."
we copy.
"it's a bucket of worms, isn't it?"
"umm, that feels good."
"and - okay, that's go. and load pitch trim a plus -"
"okay, now you got that clock counting up or down or something?"
"okay; (chuckle) that'll be great. hey, gordy, for the record; i swallowed three of those - those gas pills yesterday. 02 10 0_ 0_ cc okay. apollo 17 air-to-ground voice transcription"
"okay, gordy, i'm opening the hatch."
"okay, the thrusters - -"
"see the one we've got over there has a boulder track. that's the one, that cross-slope."
"yes, we thought it was mr. america."
"yes, that's a - no, not particularly. it's just - it would sure be low if you didn't get off the tei burn, i can tell you that."
okay; try to.
"okay, dave. first of all, no problem, we can de- lay those uv photos until after the eva. second, ""'""'_ right now midcourse 5 looks like 2 feet per sec- ond, and we do want to do it. over."
i iidn't - i reset it. i just went into zero and then off - turned the power off. that's where the alarm came from.
okay. you got the standard documentation.
"roger. apollo 13 air-t0-ground voice transcription fage 255 02 18 33 34 cdh houston, aquarius."

"jack, if you got enough film, i'll just come and help you."
okay.
roger.
"go, aquarius."
"okay, jack. you're readable. you're - okay, challenger. we read your transmission, but you're just about - just about lost in the noise. give us another count, please."
"okay. understand. oec.,nt question: when we finish mcc-7, that maneuver to sm jet']]attitude will be angles given to tis,by you, using the ags aline ball, right.?"
"okay, and then backtracking for one last one that was just handed to me; go back to 263:53."
"okay, dave. and we'll have a pad for you in a few minutes. 01 ob 47 51 cdr okay, and i guess i still have a question as why we don't take a look at that light now with the push, rap, and cycle technique. o1 ob 48 04 cc let me get a reading on that."
"right at the very first of these plans, they had taken it out. they got some alternate contingency ones there."
yes. mine is off.
"where? hey, you're right. what do you suppose they are?"
okay.
okay. the pan camera cassette is tethered. there's the pip pin.
"you - you have to raise your right side up and go to your left. it would be the best thing you could do. that's it. keep coming. up and left, up with the right and over to your left. that a boy. good show. 06 05 24 37 lmp-_ there we go. 06 05 24 38 cdr-i_m yes, you're clear."
and we're coming up now on old kastner.
"oh, yes."
"rog, and 0.5, 0.5 - half a degree dead band. cml° okay."
"it is ,lustlike - it is like we described, as very ridgey on stone - stone mountain. boulders - well, we landed in a block field, you know."
"okay. got mag xx from the camera, finally. some- tb_ng about the zero g - it kind of pulls that crazy little cassette back out of the way, and you have a heck of a time getting the lid closed on that."
roger. vt_e_.
okay.
"jim, we - we copy that - - 06 19 46 21 iamp-eva and i'm wondering whether we should leave - leave it there ..."
"roger. at 214 plus ll, if ion source, off, 5 min- utes; mass spectrometer, boom, retract. 08 20 33 lb cc 15, we'd like high gain, auto."
fire.
and i want to - to remind you to configure the dse here on - on this. 05 10 44 12 f2_p okay. thank you very much.
"okay. i_lt tell you one thing, let's t_mrnthis valve right here up a little bit. where's the helmet bags?"
we're coming across crisium.
"houston, charlie's floating on over to th_ lunar module now - to check on old orion."
"that's a satellite, jim."
yes.
"and, john, we have a new target for you."
"1c.4 ... 03 14 13 00 c_p ?hc power is off_ rhc po_fer, direct, two, off."
okay.
orion is in aft omni.
"okay. in absence of any thermal problems, this soo x-1 we're in now is going to run until 270:30."
thank you for the picture. it's the next best thing to being up there.
"i think that place where we had those small, blocky craters was within the dark mantle. i - they're not evident here in the lighter stuff."
okay.
"hold on. okay, ... lock and your cover's on. i got to zap my pga. wait a minute, i'm biting here."
"okay, we'll - we'll go ahead and go to attitude and see what we have for time."
"okay; we are roiling, by the way. and we're az 106 and - well, we're still 3.1."
"well, i can't see it. the sun was - i don't know, jack. i can't - it was about 5 - yes, about 55 or 54."
"okay (laughter), instructions i have there are to press on through that hold and go on down to just before starting the camera and then hold again and give us a call."
"we're now at o0 - 005 at 3.0. and the contact i'm talking about is at 12 o'clock, probably a couple of hundred meters."
"okay. stand by 1. iv_ _,is is one of the first opportuni-_ies that z've had to look closely at archimedes, which is one of those craters that, in the early days of the lunar mapping program, helped establish some of the funda- mental age relationships between the various units that were visible in the earth-based photography. in this particular case, it related to the sequence of events that created imbrium, cratered it, and then flooded it with mare. and archimedes is a completely circular - closed circle as a crater, and it is filled with mare. and it, in itself, is superimposed on the - one of the main benches of the imbrium crater. now, to have mare filling that crater and actually filling all the depressions of approximately the same level in the vicinity of a mare - of a large mare region, it's one of the things that's suggested to many people that rather than single sources for mare lavas, you have a multitude of sources in a very fractured lunar crust. the ultimate source in depth, though, is still certainly a subject for controversy. 08 17 20 37 imp some of the ridge and valley structure of the archimedes impact blanket is not covered by mare and extends to the southeast out onto the imbrium bench. that was also one of the pieces of evi- dence used in those early days of photogeologic mapping of the moon. you!ll have to excuse the reminiscing, gordy."
"all these dark-halo craters in the - in that one picture by that little diamond we've got up there by yerkes. the one that's farthest to the south looks like an impact type of crater. in other words, you've got a definite ejecta lopping out around on those. the one that's hard to look at in the middle of my picture, but i think it's probably the second one down from the top. it has rounded ridges - rounded rims, and - coming up on the side here i don't know if i am going to be able to see it until i go by it. it has rounded - a rounded rim. the ejeeta pattern or the dark halo is about twice the size of the ... one crater diameter. and it doesn't - it's - it's either a highly eroded impact-type crater, or it's a volcanic-type structure. and, to me, it doesn't look like a highly eroded impact one. again, that's a little one we can probably pick up ground truth, so to speak, off of the pan camera film."
but just don't touch that. it'll be okay.
"13, houston. we'd like you to isolate your 02 surge tank. over."
"boy, i'm going to tell you, when i get back from this flight, i'm going to be super shoulders after this suit."
"and a little news about your trajectory. since the midcourse 2, you've been looking real good. you've - you're homing in on 53-1/2-mile parallel. we're discussing midcourse 4, which - if we do it all - it's going to be very small. it's looking like about a foot and a half per second right now. and i guess if we do it, it will only be because it will save us delta-v at loi. over."
yes. og 05 49 ll lmp i'm going to purge.
that's fine. we can still see.
"okay, ron."
"i think one of the most impressive sights, tony, is the cloud formations you can see and the polar icecap."
"hello, 17. hello, 17. how do you read us this morning?"
"okay. 06 04 00 11 imp-eva okay, i - i - i guess we want to really start the trench first, dave."
okay. we'll observe with a pan from here. i'll take that.
"that hit on the floorboard. that's okay. *** even getting dust on my helmet. boy, this is neat, really neat. okay, now between us and the survey, tony, we really drop off again down to the base of stone. we're going down about a 4- or 5-degree slope that's still, apparently, ejecta - south ray ejecta. we're down to perhaps l0 percent now on block frequency. the character of the regolith is still the same, loosely consolidated with a rain- drop pattern. it probably looks that way because _ of the sun. i'm convinced of that. the rocks are mostly grayish with white clasts in them. tape9_/24"
we've been taking turns looking at the earth through the telescope. it's a fantastic sight.
"okay, at point a, we do a double-core lpm. i'll start with the lpm and a pan."
two-hundredths.
"i'll tell you what, why don't you park the rover ·while i make sure everything's under the lm, and we'11 dust when we get back. okay?"
"... get down there yet. got to secure the flaps. okay, you're all right."
"oh, thank you, gordy. we are go up here for pdi; doing the final trim at 4."
"that's the only place i've seen it. get a little closer, huh?"
"apollo 11, houston. over. 01 11 2._ 48 cmp houston, apollo 11. 01 11 2_ 49 cc roger. we got a liitte laser visual experiment we'd like to - for _ou to do for u;. if - if you got the earth through any of y)ur windows or through the telescope, would you sd advise? over. 0i 11 26 09 cmp stand by one, charlie. 01 11 2e 15 cmp at this roll attitude, what should our high- gain angles be? manbe that would help us locate you. we don't see you in the lens"

"okay, standing by. and i'd like to verify the cryo configuration with you and make sure that - i'll leave a battery a on charge overnight. there's no lithium canister change tonight and it looks like when you get the up-link in and i give you a verb 74, we'll be through."
it's more than that because i started after we started - -
"well, i don't know. i've only worked on one so far."
"okay, you've got to stand by on that one. things are kind of busy right now."
thirty-two echo. got three here.
"down to the maps, let's see."
"yes, it sure does. much better."
"my, you look good. your forward firing thrusters look like little flashlights when they fire."
...
i hope ...
"hello, apollo 11. houston. i wondered if during the tei burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the pugs. over. 05 15 55 06 ih5° yes, we did. based on your very excellent briefing i was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in increase. i saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so i was still expecting it to move up, and then i went down to full decrease and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent. over."
okay.
they've - they got -
"okay; what's that gonna be a target of, hank?"
...
"lean forward, you're hung up on my rcu."
"yes. i guess i finally learned that, bob, and it didn't bother me a bit. 10 i0 12 25 cc america, houston. while you're working on the fuel cell area there, we'd like to reconfigure our h2 tank fans. we'd like h2 tank 2 fans to on, h2 tank 3 fans to off."

negative; just the option 1.
okay.
okay.
"how about that, loud applause, loud applause."
how about - -
- - ... there.
main bus tie's coming off.
"okay. and, ken, on those last november november, we'll give you 30 frames on that one."
negative. i don't think so.
"okay, houston, we sampled about 3 meters southwest of the gnomon that was set up for the top of boulder soil sample. so it's a match pair, really, in that regard."
"okay. coming on; a-3, charlie 4, bravo 3, and delta 4."
okay. i'm sorry_ bob. okay; you want a nay update here?
"okay. els csm sep, bat a. bat b - closed. yes. okay. i'll bypass the old primary radiators. okay, repress package valves going on - o-n. okay. we'll cut off the service module's supply of oxygen. okay. surge tank is verified on. okay. pressure relief valves are verified normal. okay. we're verified in rcs command. okay, secondary fuel is as, bs, cs, and ds. all open. vhf is off. high gain."
"and, jim, on the - setting up the ags, right after you do the 400 plus 5, you should do a 400 plus all balls. and one other point we want to clarify is that we know that youtre sure that this burn will be made with the plus x-axis pointing at the sun to make the entry angle steeper. you got it?"
"apollo 11, houston. the s-ivb is about 6000 nau- tical miles from you now. over."
"well, i hope we gave what they wanted on that - tv show."
mark it. *** okay; about 3.4. and i got a watch.
"well, we're not quite - -"
"pick the edge of a ray, 50 meters north of an alsep site - of the alsep site. tony, i - i just don't - you can't hardly tell where one - they're not as distinct - the gradational pattern is - is just too gradual."
"okay, it's - i - i - 102 is the temperature."
okay.
okay.
okay. a quick radial sample here.
"yes, they're in the - -"
we don't need those.
"okay, we'll do that."
"okay, sock it to us. 09 ii 11 39 cc okay, it's on its way. going down the flight plan, we've got a flight plan update if you're ready to copy. it isn't too awful tong, although it's not the easiest one."
"okay. that'll be the next bit of information. i'll get that for you, jim."
"okay. i have power 6, panel 11."
"it seems like it took them a year to say ""tower's clear,"" though."
john?
okay. i - i may have copied the time down wrong or something.
okay.
on the - soraewhere around i'll try to spo_ _ more exactly - on the 20 north latitude line and about 7 east on a rimge. it's right on _op of a ridge. i think it's thaz ridge. i'll try vo spom it more exactly later.
...
i know it. it's just that it's further off on the 8-ball than normal.
"orion, this is houston. we're showing about 10 minutes to los, and i have some words for you on our general plan when it's convenient."
roger.
"i can't see it. okay. 05 22 22 26 cdr-_4 just hold it. now, just don't pull up on it."
is you about to go ahead and terminate?
"yes. well, in a little bit. confidenti., l"
okay.
"a little better than 6 inches, but it was neat looking. --"
"america, the flight plan is correct on los. to be exact, it will be 88:43:40."
yes. steady as a rock.
yes.
"okay, charlie."
was the sun shining in it?
"it still looks like i'm far from the substellar point. however, i'm off quite a hit in roll."
"that was our big thing for today, wasn't it?"
"(laughter) yes, but - -"
okay. po0 and accept.
"no. 11 11 40 08 i_p dammit, why don't you buy a set of them? ..."
"yes. i mean red to blue. did i say that right? no, reverse them."
i'll give you a hint. you're in the western hemisphere.
"hey, al, when i free this strap, would you mind ...?"
"okay, bob. it's touching the second ring; the gnomon is aligned, and i'm going to leave it alone."
see shorty out there yet?
"the dead band rate to low. limit cycle is off. att 1, rate 2."
won't it - won't it trim to those numbers that's in there?
okay.
"that would be a good place to look for it from, charlie, right up here."
not quite. don't think i can make it - without hitting you. i can't.
"okay, temperatures are good."
okay. f
"ags agrees very closely, and pointing ... (eagle )"

"and, ken, just another comment to close the loop on you on that p23s - the - like i said before, the marking data was very good, and _0u ca_me up with an horizon of 33 and loaded is a value of 28. and after massaging all the data decided to not change it since we've shown on the other missions that coming back - the - has a tendency to have a lower horizon. so, looks like we're just swinging with what we got there."
"""b-l, 3-inch mapping camera mag."""
once you get a trench at the rover - -
... bag.
"houston, this is anlerica. is there any hurry on that pan camera thing? if not, i'll take the probe out."
i keep getting keyed.
why don't you work up this film first - -
i think only in my suit.
okay. we might be 5 or 10 minutes late on starting alfmed. we're still putting some sensors on.
okay. let me see if i can't get this one here. there it is.
"wait, bob, i can give you that on the rover."
yes - but it takes attention paying.
and that is assuming no midcourse 7 here at 105 hours.
"okay, the area directly under the quad doesn't look to me like it's blistered any more than the areas everywhere else around here. that's just a qualita- tive comment. the - in fact, the paint on the quad itself is as blistered. the area directly under the nozzle on the - the plus-z jet on quad b is all blistered. i can see that in the sun. i can't tell about the other surfaces. okay, looking now at the mapping - at the mass spec and the gamma ray, i'm going to have to move aft to do that."
"well, i'll tell you, i learned a lot though."
"wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute."
"okay. and, dave and jim; this is houston, with a voice check."
"... plss mode, lmp to a."
"ll, this is houston. readback correct. out."
eva decals. etb is hanging.
anybody get that?
"*** didn't tell us to. 06 19 h3 45 cc no, we'll get it at station 8."
"oh, charlie."
roger. grab this over here.
(music: rite of the valkyrie by wagner)
"yes, i figured as much."
"thisis one of the worst bags we've had - packing. it just doesn't stay down. probably - if we get time somewhere, we ought to change that out."
chips of it.
"okay, v/h override to high altitude."
velcro's closed. okay. you know as you look at those little sparkles in the soil we're walking on and they change colors on you - -
yeah. you're gonna make me nervous ...
yeah.
ail right. we had a handoff.
"i won't, i'll put it down."
"columbia is locked up on the high gain, houston. (columbia)"
"you got anything else to do tomorrow? all right, that's what we'll do then. we'll go for a little lunar landing, how's that? unless you got something better in mind - a little surfing at the beach, or something."
okay.
"gordy, how'd that zpn turn out?"
"hey, good deal."
"oh, okay. outstanding. very good. thank you."
"okay. and when that's done, gene, we're ready for you and your dust brush to hasten back to the lm and dust each other and climb in."
"okay, was charlie 6 just two entries, 5 and 7?"
got a hag?
"okay, we understand."
okay.
ail right.
"okay, dac off -"
after center engine shutdown.
okay.
"what's that? 00 00 31 54 cml° oh, i got a - a caution and warning on the pgns. i don't know what that was. must have been taking it out of the - mode is manual. optics coupling is direct. speed, hi. now if .._ up there. the zero's off. go max speed to the right. the first one that comes off is the sextant at 40 degrees."
yes. just noticed that.
"okay, sir, you ready to go on up?"
"okay, there she goes. and, we're up to half; up to l; 1.5; 2.0. okay, you can go cabin pressure ... and go press reg a and b to cabin."
yes.
okay - -
"we would like to have you leave the two core tubes, and the extension handle, and the hammer, and the - i suppose, the core cap dispenser here. if you get back in time from doing all our appointed tasks at the vip site and at the alsep, we'll try and drive a double core here - -"
"for a minute or so. and, jack, i guess right now, you might get some fairly rapid samples in the area, since you're probably almost ready to leave. and can you tell us what you saw there in the vicinity of the - you were giving us a description of the boulders there and plateness of the - and alignment of the crystals - the plag. you want to amplify that a little bit?"
"good morning, casper. how are you feeling this morning?"
"okay, that's what iyll do. never get any pictures that way."
roger.
"gordy, how does america look to you this morning?"
go.
here's number 2.
":_ot down this far. one thing i did notice - further outside of where we saw the white underneath - but it looked like an impact had either been of the white rock or it was a splatter of white. and it vas just outside where a1 was reporting that the underlying layer was white. as a matter of fact - no, that just - the sun angle was causing it. right now, some of the spray that we're kicking up looks white underneath, but i'm convinced it's just the angle. i looked back the other way, and it - it's not substantiated."
"no, you have it on two different pages."
go ahead.
back up a little more -
"- - ... documented samples there - up on the slope of the massif, before you move down the flatter light mantle areas by the rover. just do the other sampling."
(laughter )
negative. that was 72:30.
you're coming through my side.
yes.
"houston, 16."
"okay. that's a good point - let me change my headsets here. anyway, i went right through the flight plan with all that stuff."
those rocks have been waiting 4-1/2 billion years for us to come grab them. {ionfident
"ah-ha, i get to get out of ey g suit."
"aquarius, houston. over."
they work on the repress valve.
"okay. in the meantime i'll look at the seatbelt. if i can do anything with it. 05 22 5_ 23 cdr-eva okay. 05 22 55 3_ cdr-eva *** adjust my ... all the way on my seatbelt. okay, i think without the extension handle, it ought to work okay."
yes.
righto.
"that's right. i told them about those earlier. that's the only no - i think, gene, you want to bear a little bit - hold on - a little bit to the left. see those two craters, two bright craters, that are just this side of lara?"
"disregard, al. i thought i heard you call, and it was just something else in the background, i guezs."
"ail right. 09 02 21 2_ lmp it's on the - the rewind, right - the record ... time skip"
looks like we overdid it. i should'ye kept - i thought about keeping one of those jett bags ...
okay.
"well, i wahted - i thought they wanted a core in that depression."
yeah.
and we got the time base fix indication on time.
... clipper. that sounds good.
okay. let's turn it upside down and shake it.
"joe, what - we know - let's see you want 2 and 5 on the hand tool carrier, and the rest under the seat, is that correct?"
"okay, fred, i've got six circuit breakers for you."
do it.
"ah, sure can. you bet you. i think the best way to do it is with the 250 lens on the hasselblad."
"this southern and southwestern pol_ion of seren- itatis has a general appearance of the sculptured hills, although the individual hills seem to be more widely spaced than around taurus-littrow. once again, historically, we're passing over the landing site of apollo , or near the landing site of apollo 15."
ye_.... do it in a minute. 03 12 00 15 cml° ...
"all over the world, there is."
yes.
"okay, there ain't nothing we can do about it if that module ain't holding attitude. _"" _aa'_ _ ::'3 _'_'_"
"camera's got so much dust on it, i - 06 21 07 51- cdr-eva there's a little bench in the bottom of scarp crater, halfway up - about a tenth the diameter of the crater. and it's only in - and it seems to be all the way around, somewhat irregularly."
"too much back, jim - you go back too much. come to your right now. come to your right. come to your right. that's it. now you're in. that's it, jim. ... too far back when you get on it."
"yes. you can hold that, and i'll just try to roll it up as best i can without getting any - i already got a little dirt on it ... you know what i mean? 05 il 57 00 cdr yes."
0ks_. it scares me everytime tha_ light comes ch. ah ha! it went away ....... what the coarse align error is.... just barely in the sextanv field of view.
... good.
yeah. okay ....
i think i got it. i think i got it.
"okay. go ahead, charlie."
okay.
"okay. me see. okay, the tge is reading. we got to stow our antennas and ... dusting down here. i'll make a check of what you've got up there. what have you got up there so far?"
okay. we copy that. it's in the big bag.
"oh, man, is it hard to get around here! ._-50 day 7"
"copy that. okay. when you guys get done with that rock, we'd like to get to the rake sample, please. and that's probably just as well done by the rover as anyplace else. we don't seem to see anything worthwhile here doing besides that."
"here, i'll get it. end of transcription nasa -- msc -- coral., houston, texas"

"okay, now take the optics out of zero and back to zero."
why? what did you do?
... mines 111.
"if you're going to be operating this ... for 3 days, we ought to try and set up a system to square it away."
"okay, bob. i'm going to try to give them a call now, down at falcon."
everything is working today.
where did we leave it?
"... i'm going to get the picture. get the picture. okay, let's hop on out and get one more. yes, it's pretty sparse out here. gosh, we're only - not very far at all. i'm not sure that the ones out here aren't thrown up from ..."
"are you happy with that, bob? i'm - roll indicator is indicating - make it 3 degrees right - 3 degrees right."
roger.
"negative, dave. the change at 252:00 should just be continued through until 261 hours. and that's just the dap - dap load status - should be changed correspondingly through until that time."
"that's complete, jack. panel 11 is configured."
"hey, bob, you're staying keyed an awful long time. we can hear a lot of what's going on back there. *** that's got it."
okay.
what's the 203 ... ?
this looks like a piece of breccia looks like a fragment briccia that got caught up in this thing.

yes.

...
back on this one?
now it's gray. laser altimeter is on -
"okay, ken. following this, we want you to - this attltude'll be good, all the way up to 172:30. and we want you to get an eat period in there. and at 172:15, do a p52."
"yes, i ..."
"and, apollo 16, i guess it's okay to go to that optics zero in zero, which you are, and g&n power optics, off."
"good show. here's a bag; here's a bag. okay. if you can hold on to this little one, i'll roll up the big one."
"okay, joe, the alsep pictures are complete."
"okay, gordy. that little storm - fairly big storm - that was off the coast of northwest africa yesterday, has moved inland and presumably is giving those people up there some weather. might even be getting some snow up in the atlas mountains. it's still fairly well organized and inland a few hundred miles - or the edge of it is inland a few hundred miles. the people at the cape of good hope ought to be seeing some clouds that are forerunners of a large circulation system that's south- southwest of them- that, although large, it seems to have most of its heavy clouds to the southeast of the center. and they may not get any major weather out of this one. but they'll probably have cloudiness for a few days. the storm that was over buenos aires yesterday has apparently moved out to sea and is now west - or east- southeast of that area. otherwise the - except for those three storm areas, the south atlantic looks relatively calm. the zero phase point is now off the - east coast of south america, and it looks fairly dull and gray. and i suspect no ex- tensive choppiness in that area."
"how about a food stick? can i have a food stick, charlie?"
"okay, houston. ready to go with the right-hand column. u-4 is as perscribed [sic], and r-2 is as perscribed [sic]."
"i can't reach - look at me, john."
okay.
okay.
yes.

there he goes.
"direct, two, off."

four. five.
"okay, thrust-to-weight is good - 66,000 feet. they were right on."
go now.
"okay, we're heading on back to sep."
"amd 16, there's an advisory - when you do ia - going to the p52. you'll probably get a l01 alarm, which means that you've exceeded 60 degrees middle gimbal angle. you can go on with it, _ay."
"okay. flight plan updates, 214 plus 41. the - we delete the pan - -"
"well, i didn't intend to be transmitting. we were just discussing the battery vent and things. we may have missed something in the dump checklist. we'll check it out."
"what we got to do, pete?"
"no, it's too big."
roger. and you're go at 7.
"yeah, that's got most of it."
"did you call, al?"
roger. that sounds fine to us.
"okay. i have a tone-on, vent flag plee - p [sic], and pressure flag o. 02 pressure gage is reading about 94 percent. and, how do you read me, jim?"
"ail right, sir."
go the other way.
"would you put the - you're loud and clear, dave. would you put the iu up tel - - time skip"
no. the det is over on the left side.
"okay, ron. that's very consistent data both ways on ttmt - after the burn. it doesn't tie up with the data prior to the burn too well."
"okay. let's see now. your pga is in the l-shaped bag with the other two pga's, and your helmet and gloves are in the l-shaped tag instead of the sleep restraint."
could you push it a little further?
"i agree with you. okay. 5018, it's there, and 5018, and that's what it will be. okay."
"go ahead, charlie."
how's that?
"one thing, dave, before you leave."
"man, i tell you. that ascent engine coming on, you - you - it was a real - it wasn't what i expected, an)u_ay. at ignition, there, it seems like it sort of sits a little bit, then it grabs you and, boy, off you go! and it takes you a while - at least, it did for me - to get my eyeballs uncaged. and we were - then all i saw out the window was the mesa blanket; then we were back on the gages."
204.
"okay, houston. we'll be done with p22 in just a couple of minutes."
"... what you do - what you do, you put your - 0b 04 14 36 cmp not bad ..."
you want to - i don't care. where is the best place for you to be?
we should have a horizon check at 17 minutes also.
"okay. we're to drive the commander's ball to a pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. and we should have in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750, plus 00450."
"okay, houston. the black clasts in this rock are really - really black material. it's either a very fine-grained black breccia - i'll tell you what it looks like. it looks like that black breccia, fine-grained line that had that white clasts in it on apollo 15. although here, the matrix is white, and the clasts are black."
"apollo 13, houston. over."
"okay, 377. and you've got about 10 minutes now, and we'd like to get that csvc."
anything else in there?
"okay. go ahead. i'm ready, joe."
"okay. the first extra is, and let me get the original question because this question says, qmore specifically on item 2,"" and item 2 says, 'fwere there any significant changes in the noise ¥ihration level during the single stage of powered flight?"" specifically, describe your observations during the early s-ii center engine out-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to tli cut-off_ you reported a high vibration in the s-ivb. we'd like you to describe the buildup of this vibration and its behavior through cut- off. over."
"okay. thank you, hank. hey, listen. we could go to a sim attitude or something and clean up in that attitude. we don't have to stay in this attitude, hank, because it's gonna take us a long time to get these suits off and get all this stuff stowed. maybe like an hour or so."

"bob, one little notice. supplies i had this morn- ing. might made notes, so i wouldn't forget about it. it was when you go to tunnel vent, it takes a heek of a long time to vent that tunnel. in the simulator down there, you go to tunnel vent, and it flips right down and vents. and i was beginning to wonder if it - if it was leaking or something."
84:32. 32. add the following.
"liesays, he thinks he can see altair. 05 19 17 /t4 cc okay. i'll take back the ""very,"" but i'll leave the ""good."""
"america, houston. would you just close the ir, and we'll cue you on the off call? we'd like to see it here, and we'd like to do that as a cue."
good. good show.
lgc/dsky. i'm sorry.
probably ... supposed to be with the cue cards.
huh?
"i know it, and lots of craters."
"stand by, ken."
(laughter) okay ......
we've been looking for the big man with the white gray beard.
"hey, are we in sim bay attitude?"
okay. fine.
everybody always has.
"dave, your out-of-plane data looks like about 2/10ths of a mile at pdi time."
all right. i just pulled the pin.
houston. roger. out.
"one time. that disappeared, too? that probably went into orbit. l_dp-eva yes."
"you're loud and clear. 01 t0 06 30 i_mp okay, give me a short count please, pete."
"jim, this is houston. and we're still listening to you. in the meantime, i've got a map camera f_ pad to give to a1 when he's ready. over."
...
"okay, we - -"
so did i.
... set is 290 - -
"yes, sir. they had a terrific day. i think they're going to sleep well tonight."
"the - the unlit part of the moon, as you might expect, is just as dark from here as is deep space itself."
"go ahead, joe."
"morning, bob. i'm ready to copy."
"stand by. nfide'n""t'l"
it is.

okay.
"it's breakfast, day 7 meal a."
watch out. bet you're going to go over here a minute.
copy. 50 and 37.
"challenger, if you - if you think you're talkin_ to us, you're breaking up badly."
okay.
"okay, pump is open."
"endeavour, houston. best omni."
"apollo 17, houston. still reading you with a lot of background noise. over."
yes.
i'm just now beginning to understand what went on.
"ep-2; right. bob, we're still - we're moving in and out of areas of say 1-percent to 5- to 10-percent blockiness. and where it gets blocky - not only is it more blocky, but we seem to have more of the *** craters in the range of 20- to 5-meter-diameter craters. that may be mariner right there. how do you read, bob?"
"the word at the present time is let's leave them just as they are, dave."
"yes. put one on. i'll take the pictures, and then i'll get you. 06 22 02 ob iamp-eva yes. okay, i have a number."
good signal. (columbia)
"give it a swat; there you go. lmp-ii_j oh, the beauty of - ..."
okay.
"hello, tranquility base. houston. you are stay for a t3. we have some surface block data if you're ready to copy. over."
"11, houston. that's a beautiful picture now, we've got. we're looking at a 12-second delay. to us you are just bringing it down by the optics now."
that's why - that's why i was glad i could see the ground.
"okay, and the last point is defined by delta-vm of 265; an abort delta-v of 2105."
"do you read us now, don?"
okay. secure the hoses - the lm hoses.
"okay, houston. checked it out above mdc number 2."
- - copy 156.
"charlie, while we're working that, can you copy about four short items into the flight plan at 226:40?"
i got to do that.
"okay, the hatch is closed, joe."
you got a lot of surface area on that hatch.
88.
"i'm watching here, bob. noun 20."
okay. that's locked.
i've assisted you. here comes the jett bag when- ever you're ready.
"minus 5, minus -"

"apollo 11_ houston. some of the general last minute updates here. on the entry, we had told you on the camera to set _t at oo t'eet. it turns out the biggest number on the can'ara is 25 feet, so just set it at infinity. over."
"""inflight exerciser,"" that's in there. 'water - h2 gas separators, two in a bag."""
"okay, that's d as in delta. and then in the same column down - it says ""2 - 16 mags r and s."" we'd like to chaage that to ""1 - 16 mag s."""
okay.
beautiful. i
"hey, gene and ron, this is the csm capcom. thought you might be interested. your buddy up on - above you there is chugging on and about ready to bed down himself, right now. and he did take a good look at the landing site through binoculars tonight and took a good look at shorty crater there, and noticed quite a lot of variations in color. that may be the same color changes you saw in that orange soil and that, but we're trying to match it up. and farouk and ron are working it out. we're trying to match it all up and see if we can get a comparison there."
okay. i think we'll go ahead and burn the pgns. 07 04 22 38 limp ... maneuver now?
"okay. 07 23 21 0h cc ncw, that's gonna temporarily wipe out the lmp bus, but don't worry about it. the next step is ""_at 5 normal feed, on,"" so we'll get it back there. okay - -"

okay; will do.
"go ahead, columbia."

yes - -
any suggestions?
"man, let me see. i need to see the what maps? oh, you puv them - yes - - 03 12 04 51 _ i put up there."
"all right, after we'w? done that, we want to get panel 8, sequential, pyro arm, two of them, on."
"and, 15, we're observing yaw of 61 degrees right now."
"vance, this is jack."
"that right there. yes, three of them. i threw away all the dirty ones, i think. (laughter) the whole time. boy, it - yes, it sure whipped out through there when i opened the hatch."
"houston, this is falcon. we're locked up on the - the high gain. how do you read?"
and the cabin pressure's about 4.5. you want us to wait until 5 psi for the emergency cabin pres- sure selects ?
okay. you think stubby is punched into the edge - -
"okay. under 4 minutes, minus 4 minutes, add back in mode control, both, to att hold. 05 09 19 10 lm[' okay. mode control, both, to att hold."

"it on? 04 23 46 05 l_ip-lm yes, it's on. the only question is whether it's on completely all the way. i think it is. i'll know as soon as the cooling comes in."
"ken, your current attitude is good for stars 15 and 21."
"roger. stand by one. tranquility, affirmative. proceed."
stand by.
that's a - wait a second until we get in position.
"that's affirmatiw-. we're readin_ you. we're, trying to como up with :_, go_l ido:m hr'pc i'<,t' you."
"okay, tony. i've picked up a rock here that has a aphanitic matrix with perhaps b0 percent of it white - whitish millimeter-size clasts or pheno- crysts, and it doesn't look glassy to me."
whoops. the other way. there we go - 06 21 24 36 cdr/ locked. lmp-lm
okay; i've got you a solid lock on the high gain.
"okay, bob. i got it hooked up."
okay. thank you.
okay. monitor launch-vehicle tank-pressure sequence.
"11, houston. we request that you rede p52, and if the angles come out the same m_nitude, go ahead and incorporate them. over. 00 05 36 42 cm! okay. we'll do that."
in work - in work.
"dave, the mnly problem is, if we're able to get the deep samples using the drill stems, we'd like them in the src. i guess we'll leave it up to you, your choice. we - maybe better just to take bag 5 over there right now and forego that little nicety."
"ah, charlie, such form. 05 0t 12 11 l_-eva }iowabout that? i'm going out for the ballet when i get back. you learn another line of work up here. hey, that was fantastic news about the house passing the bill, tony. it really started a great day today for us."
"good show, gang."
"roger. understand, suiting completed."
"okay, wait a minute; let me read on."
"okay, i'm looking for - i'm dying to find out what this mound is over here anyhow, al. we got a very peculiar mound sticking up out of the ground, houston, that i want to go look at. as a matter of fact, i think i'll go take a picture of it. oh my -"
roger. postlanding vent flight slash postlanding to open.
okay.
"... hose, huh?"
i couldn't even believe that.
"okay. that's a good observation. from the films you've seen of other descents, do you think the dust was less than any of the others? 04 11 53 03 lmp-_4 well, john will have to really comment on that, but as far as my side goes, the little i looked out there was by far - we could see - or, i could, on my side, see right on down through it - the dust film."
we were off - -
"okay. understand you're sitting on 30, ready to take n_rmher 30. and you've got 11 pictures left."
"okay. copy that, jack. and how far down the ' north massif is the line of boulders?"
we've got plenty of radar. we're going to do it.
let me get back here in the corner. watch your plss. there you go.
that help?
"be kind of hard to get a radar lock. oh, no."
go.
"and, how are the stars out the window now?"
"when i - when i was eating with the ambassador in kuwait, i saw him staring suspiciously when i got both arms on the table and put them together. he says (laughter) - i never did figure it out."
"okay; i'm trying to - such the stuff back in the - the entry tube there, and it looks like part of it's going in."
"f:ll, 15, 1 - - 05 14 1! 35 lmp it's going to be a tough shot, because it's in the sun, but i'll get - let it go. get over here; that might help it."
_ud then the rest of you will stand on your heads.
"apollo 12, apollo 12, this is airboss. over."
negative. we want to see if it'll stabilize.
"columbia, houston. we noticed you are maneuver- ing very close to gimbal lock. i suggest you move back away. over."
it's in the - it's in the purse.
okay.
okay. verify cuff gage doesn't drop below 4.6. i'm looking at 5.1.
"okay; give a call at 09:50, too. 09 03 38 04 _ i will. 09:45 now."
fuel's 35.4 -
"gene, if you got time there with the camera, why don't - when you get done with the camera, how about getting some gray tape and we'll put you to work on sep for about a minute."
"(laughter) they got the (laughter) they got the message all right. yeah, that's going to be a real good find, houston."
i've done that twice.
okay. onfid t/i#ii 6
...
roger. we have that in our monitor also.
"okay, bag 467 is where your kilogram is coming from."
"yes, it is unlocked. t_ip-eva okay. now push down and turn. cdr_eva okay. i got it. i_._-eva ..."
"one camera, two cameras. come on, little fellow. here comes one tv camera."
roger.
... getting to my ...
"the only trouble is, he goes out even before you start burning. 05 23 08 ho cmp ... too, pete. ih"
we want to go to this auxiliary ecliptic first.
"737100. roger. 35500, plus 33000 ...."
"that's affirmative, pete."
roger.
"yes. get it at infinity, f/8 - f/8 at infinity and maybe take another one up here - another 15 or 20 meters or so. get a good stereo down to the south."
"orion, this is houston. we read you rather weak. how do you read us?"
"helmet and gloves on. cabin repress, close."
"okay. h2 purge heaters have been on 20 minutes. we'll have to start the oxygen purge and then a ihydrogen purge. 03 12 07 29 _ okay. 03 12 07 30 _ mark. mark, mark, mark."
"houston, could you give us a hack on where we stand relative to the tlme, please?"
"vhf am a and b going off. okay, hank, your vhf is off. i'm turning off the fuel pumps now. high gain antenna power is coming off. fuel cell pumps, three, off. gonna get some mas here, probably, in a little bit. fuel cell 2 main a coming off. it is. verify loads balanced; i and 3 perfectly balanced. batteries picked up the load. okay, cb ecs rad control/heaters, two, open. rad control; they are open. cb rads heaters overload, two, open. they're open. waste h20 dump - are open. potable h20 heater -"
"go ahead. go ahead, houston."
"yes. how do you do that, al?"
"and, dave, as you might guess, when jim comes out, you can delete that step to deploy his antenna."
"roger. i have that squeal, also."
yes. we're getting down to the place where we won't see it.
"there it is - man! now, go out, dust and every- thing."
okay; i'll do that. the challenger looks as good as ever. no problems at all through the night.
"okay. go ahead, hank."
you can go normal voice.
"okay, want to go %hrough %he _j?s start card? 07 03 33 03 i__ yes. i will, dave, in just a second. i'm just checking e - eps."
"water, excuse me, water sep. well, the next thing it says that gene gets out."
yes.
"okay, right at 10."
"orion, casper."
we're retracting.
we have no druthers. as long as we do the mid- course and there is plenty of tracking thereafter to correct for another midcourse; that's my only concern.
"yes, you're d_n right ..."
"houston, 16. i'm ready for the block data update."
...
"buzz, this is houston. you have approximately 3 minutes until you must commence your eva ter- mination activities. over. 04 15 18 l4 lm2 roger. understand. 04 15 18 q2 cc columbia, this is hot_ston. approximat_.ly 1 minute to los. over."
"roger, that. i was just questioning the rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done."
"okay, hank. just make sure that i get a break here about 94:49. okay, go ahead with your pads."
yes.
"aquarius, houston. can you see any stars out the lm window? 02 !0 47 53 lmp we'll have to wipe them off, jack. they're coated with water right now."
"ten, yeah."
"you have no - no worry about that, gene. we're looking at it real close."
okay.
"the only thing we got open right now, ron, is the ou and ascent pad or pads."
understand.
"can you tell us if we have the tape recorder running on board in a forward direction, so we can record on it. and looks like we need about an hour's worth of tape. or are they in a playback cycle, or what are they doing?"
"i'll take one right now, pete."
"okay, karl."
"first of all, on the gamma ray experiment, dr. arnold reports that a1 worden probably performed the first recorded repair of a scientific instru- ment in space, because earlier in that day he'd begun to experience some problem with excess noise in the gr_ma ray experiment. and when a1 went out in the eva - we don't know what happened there - but at the end of the eva, the gamma ray cleared up and has been doing beautifully ever since. you must have given it a pretty good kick there, al."
"okay; bottom line on page 5-4. cut-off minus 10 seconds, ""circuit breaker sps pilot valve, main a, open."""
n...u....i. d_'t umderstand why i can't get a-1 closed.
"now, wait a second, pete. let me back up a little better."
okay.
"very good, dave. 04 09 45 40 cdr-i_m okay, houston; the torquing angles are up."
okay; we're going mode switch to 1.
roger.
"the lcg is a ... okay. everything feel good in there? ail right, now, just let me sit down; i don't want to rip your ..."
"(laughter) oh, i filled in, every once in a while so that's not too bad."
"okay, i missed all you said about that page 3-4. you read me?"
"okay. go ahead and slew it, orion."
stand by.
"43, 4-3."
"yeah. 07 08 53.35 cmp i've got plus 0.5, minus 0.5 and plus 2.2."
"yeah. no, i'm sorry. 2.6. excuse me."
"and, falcon, the data looks good. we have a tm check."
ac/dc.
*** i haven't been doing my duty on locators occasionally.
"no, sir. i - i tried to get them in last night and we decided they'd close up shop before i could get them in."
"okay. we copy that, charlie. 05 05 42 57 i2_p-lm got two green on the lioh cans."
and i have some flight plan changes for you.
"orion, we'd like cabin gas return in egress. 07 07 19 48 m_p-lm roger. it's in egress. 07 07 21 36 lmp-_ jim, how does the tube look? we're ready to pressurize the aps now."
"hey, joe, i just did a delta-v and null bias check if you want to copy ..."
"okay, you're locked."
yes. sure.
copied all those.
the old hammering hand -
"roger. that's affirmative. and you should have gotten the tone, and we'd like you to try it again. and we're thinking it through right now."
"i'm going down this slope and up the other side, jack."
"well, th_k you. just a shot, you _ow, like maybe 30 seconds worth, then _uit."
okay.
"okay. as is obvious, you can delete all of the midcourse activities, beginning there at 11:21, running through the burn status report. and the other activities this evening can be moved up so that you can go to bed as early as 12 hours get, if you wish. a couple of notes here that we do want you to stay up until 12 hours in order that we can finish a battery charge that's in progress. and_ also_ that waste water dump; be sure to - to do the water dump before you start ptc."
"okay. fuel cell 1, you just wanted it off the line now, jack, is that right?"
"present data indicates that you_' entry an_le is mjnu._ 6.03 degrees, your det,ta-v at the mideourse is [_oingto 2.8 feet a second."
okay. why don't you give us another l0 minutes or so?
okay. i'm getting a little bit of a squeal on the initiation of my transmission.
atlantic landing?
yes.
"not flat like that, i bet you."
"orion, casper."
okay. do you want to turn your fan on for circulation?
go ahead.
"apollo 11, this is houston. readback correct. for your information, goldstone reports receiv- ing approximately 1 minute of fm downlink car- rier. we were getting ready to request you confirm on the s-band aux switches, the s-band aux tape switch to off and the s-band aux tv switch to tv. over."
"okay. bob, lmp is getting purge 211."
"hey, houston. this crater looks like - -"
"hey, if this side falls over, then i'm really going to he mad. i got that thing firmly planted."
"okay, it's a long one. the first one is the csm state vector. 71; get is 188:01:42. index is 21. the following line is all data. i'll break about every five, if you want to stop me. opposite 02 we go - data as follows: 01501, 00002, 7v563, 77431, 77517, 45633, 00013, 11736, 65021, h3762, 11131, 31244, 07624, 10720, 10043, 17330, end of the csm state vector. read back. c?,_ okay. verb 71: 188:01:42; 21; 01501, 00002, 775or3, 77431, v,7__,_7, 45633, 00013, _i_]6j , 65021 43762, 11131, 31244, 07624, 10720, 10043, 17330."
"i think that'd been pushing it a little. l0 0b 38 12 cc question 12, for each of you - -"
"okay. i'm ready. 35 09 h8 46 cc okay. we want to add h2 tanks i and 2 heaters, auto. h2 fans 1, 2, 3, off."
no.
"well, you certainly ride high."
"okay, i - understand."
"both of them in egress. okay. plss 02, on, charlie."
"roger. we cycled one before we took it off, too. i think we're in good shape, houston."
"boy, i tell you what i need now is some gatorade. wow! i could drink 3 gallons of the stuff. i opened up my checklist here and look at all that work and that reminds me - work time."
you got two pockets: one on each foot.
"jim, we're reading you loud and clear. it's okay. 06 23 26 16 i_4p-eva oh, yes, i had my volume low; that might have something to do with it."
that's the one you - that's the number you gave me. 04 i- 15 18 cdr okay.
"disconnect 0ps hose. connect lm hoses - red to red, blue to blue. i_mp-lm i don't want lm hoses yet. i'll just get on water right away."
"okay, the biomed data looks good."
"okay, how are you coming on the pads, gordy?"
that sounded like one of gordy's aircraft schedules.
"ken, hold up on that verb 41 just a second."
"that's funny. looks like it fits in there pretty well. oh, what's in - okay. you're going to put the camera on anyway."
"if i eat all this, i'm gonna explode."
i got it. i got it.
"okay. i got the table out, ... the mesa, and i'm setting up etb at this time. let's see. how is this packed? very nice. very nice. pa e i 'onfidential '"
"okay, now what?"
let me - i'll ... - -
_yeah.
"that's affirmative. we - we circled it - at grimaldi b and the east and north of grimaldi b, right in that area."
"i know you do, but us florida boys don't know much about it."
looks like they hit the right spot?
"okay. okay,,houston. one rock box inside."
okay.
another demonstration.
yes.
"boy, i'll tell you. if we can't recognize a change in that albedo when we get onto that white mantle, i'm going to be surprised."
"appreciate the work you've done, and jack says that it's going to be nard to beat his record about saving sm rcs fuel all the way there and back."
sure thing. can i read back the ... when i read back the ones that said it?
"right. after we did all that work and succeeded in retracting it, now we'll deploy it."
"roger that. just stay out of gimbal lock and that 45-degree isn't critical - the out of plane, that is."
"yes, he did."
yeah.
"well, it's not doing so bad today. yesterday, in the dark passes, all the windows were fogging up and every time i'd breath i had t° go wipe the window off. looked like i was standing in front of a pet store. and i haven't had that trouble -_ today at all. and it looks like it's slowly drying tape84/28 itself out. we had an awful lot of condensation in here - showed up during - after loi. all down in the suit bay was a great big puddle of water, and we had not been aware of any collection of water anywhere before that. but it had obviously been there. it didn't come out of the tunnel, but it just sort of finally all condensed. and any time you go in to clean out the suit circuit return screen, why, down in the bottom of that compartment you can see that there's a - there's condensation on some of the lines and there's a little moisture in the bottom of the compartment."
"hey, don't - don't touch that. i've got a - one boyd bolt off it."
"roger. that's affirm, dave."
roger.
"190, 25; looking good. ags and pgns tracking right together, houston."
"hey, al, what happened to the light ...? ... huh?"
"ron, it's going to run you from 6.7 entry angle to a 6.h9. r tape _99/9"
where'd you put the second garbage can?
"16, on your request on the amp-hours on the batteries: battery alfa is 36, battery bravo 30.3, and ch_rlie 39.0."
"give me that, and get a new one. give me that. get some more."
"okay, jack, ... rest of my dusting until - -"
"sti [1 h,!m_, i""_'('(t."
let's hold off until we get to the next - -
"forty-six, bob, is going into the long can."
...
yes.
"134 is looking at the lunar module, houston. you don't want to do that."
*** 236/2.1.
that's right. we'll never have time to use it all.
"no, we didn't."
nope. not yet.
okay. let me set it down and work on it right here.
"yes, i read you, a1 - ed."
"ail right, sir. just a moment."
"that's better. okay. cb(il) comm, cdr audio, open, and connected to plss comm."
roger. we're following you right on the line.
roger. we feel fine.
"oh, don't worry about it. i'd like to have you talk with us. volts and amps coming up."
"uh-oh, do i hear a tone? 04 19 28 21 i24p yes. i've got an h20 a."
not at this angle.
i'm not to geo prep yet.
... 07 04 27 43 i24p and everything looks good.
"comm, okay? vhf, off, off."
"houston comm tech, goldstone comm tech."
"okay. delete the ""mapping camera retract,"" and the ""cover close."""
"i'd really forgotten how that thing kicks you in the seat of the pants. i guess i must have been floating off the seat a little bit more this time than i was on the - the rest of the burns. 07 12 00 26 cm_ okay. pan camera power is off; and the old logic power should go to deploy/retract. okay, ... down is a, down is b. deploy/retract. got - to inhibit all jets. okay, we'll inhibit the - all except the roll, right now."
we haven't got them yet.
...?
"okay. i ass6me we're - we're go for lift-off, (tranq) and we'll proceed with the ascent feed."
okay. copy that.
okay.
okay ... some more.
roger.
six more hours? jesus christi
"no, just stay where you are."
"not really, since we do that with our plss and everything else."
looks like she came out of there clean as a whistle.
"al, we have some questions for you on the sim bay experiments, whenever you have some time to answer them."
"okay, go ahead with that. charlie's all ears."
mount the timeline book. we got that. configure circuit breaker panels.
"oh, we just finished eating and cleaning up a bit afterwards. jim's going around collecting debris off of all the inlet hoses. and, i guess you might say we're kind of thinking about getting ready to go to sleep."
"roger. be advised, you don't have to wait until 5 psi cabin to go ahead and open the hatch."
... is 155.
"okay. 06 22 02 58 ii,p-eva - - pull the thing, and - -"
no. we'll get it at station 8.
okay. and we've lost one piece of - -
"okay. 04 19 30 13 _,_ that's what i'm sweating."
"okay. we need some little rock fragments from here, pete. you'll have to hold up the bag so i can reach it."
"give me some more slack up here, you're draped."
yes. i have that on the map.
"hey, this is not so bad, if you think of iced tea, i guess."
"that must have been it,"
okay. understand.
yes.
"no problem. just one question, ron, that is the hasselblad we're hearing every once in a while, isn't it?"
"okay; ken just turned the camera over, you can have him turn the other way now."
"yes, we should be coming up on the inner ridge system here in a moment, and we - we'll try and pan down along the - the inner ridge."
"you know, i was looking at d-caldera and you got a lobate - a lobate flow front sticking down in the crazy thing. i'll be darned."
"there you go. now, let me trench it. 05 12 23 37 l_ep okay."
yes.
i broke that ode.
"lmp, 211; cdr_ 208. i_-hm i take it those are serial nut,hers."
and the rev switch is going off.
roger; sounds consistent.
are you firing anything?
"i went to voice ranging and duplex bravo, and i could hear you, but i couldn't receive."
... you guy ... over there?
go ahead.
what?
*** careful with it.
"endeavour, houston. you're on the scan limit. go to reacq when you're at the angles."
"okay. very good. just thought maybe we'd get our navigator to navigate again, and it would probably go away, as most of them have done so far."
"okay, that was up here in u - -"
"amazing how far over -now the highlands to the west of procellarum are - still are bright, and the contrast between fresh craters and the normal high- land are very - are very obvious still in earthlight, particularly along the zero phase point with respect to the earth. rima gamma now is - is coming a lit- tle bit closer to our oval track in the horseshoe in the - larger and more western end of it; the dark horseshoe is quite clear in this light. it's a west - or northwest-pointing horseshoe, as is the complete trend of that strange feature. i think ron is going to have an excellent chance to study these light-colored swirls within the mare and other parts of the moon. we had some good views of them and mare marginis and to the east of crisium - mare crisium, and he should - if there is anything to be seen, he should be able to see it for - during the next few days."
(laughter) all right.
"okay, al."
mark; 04:30.
"hey, jack--"
"okay, jack."
yes.
negative. accept only.
...
...
"man, that 'll hold you down."
"okay, ken, and we're coming up on a site handover. we may lose comm for a second!"
"you have a new, new star chart. you must have a new, new star chart. huh?"
same here from the cdr. i haven't seen anything.
"roger. guess we were changing antennas. stand by. that's affirmative, 11. we were swapping antennas on you down here. basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the gyro's, and very small drift in the pipa's. over."
"okay, tony. okay, tony. i'm doing some vertical stereo - stereos of these rays coming out of the crater. 0h! out of film."
roger; and we'll take tv; that's plenty good enough.
"no, i can't, vance. it's - it's still too light. tape 2]/5"
"the reading is 670, 023, 501; that's 670, 023, 501."
go ahead.
"well, we'll get it."
"- - take the filter off the front of my camera, would you?"
"okay. did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?"
"dave, give me a call on your present activity."
- - it reset them all.
i think you're right.
"yeah, i got the dac off."
let's get some cooling in here.
okay.
"and it's in 341. whack off - whack off another piece right here, john."
"all right. our understanding on the mission timer is that, even though you tried to reset it, it still refused to count up. is that correct?"
before we get any dirt on it.
"okay. 07 23 32 3h cc okay; the next page, 2-8."
"that's correct, lb. as i recall the flight plan, you're supposed to put mustard on the hot dogs and not catsup, but i guess we'll overlook that."
mark cmp. _
"well, you got to go -"
"roger, ll. that's pretty significant. thank you much, buzz."
okay. sens - vox sensitivity is full up.
"roger, ken. we're showing you at 3 psi now."
stand by.
it'll do - not waste any more time thinking about it.
no water.
"okay. ops connect; i2,_rfirst. suit isolation to suit disconnect? 05 21 53 13 i_mp suit ***"

"there's going to be a lot of happy people down there, bob. i haven't checked them all, but vis- ually, they're all locked."
"would you stand by just for a second, please? okay, hank."
super.
"okay, dave and jim. jim, we think you can collect the samples here pretty well. and, dave, in order to get that - that drill task accomplished, we're going to have to get you started on that shortly."
60: have i taken 60 pictures?
i've eaten worse food in the last 3 days than i've eaten in my ... 03 13 12 h9 cdr got to start watching this baby here - see what happens.
"they don't have a good up-link, gene. i - i had signal strength. and now i don't have any at all."
"okay. sorry to rush you, but i just got handed - - 06 19 57 09 _p that's all right."
okay. it's cycled.
okay. the nominal station 4 would be on a bearing of 3.56. but you're going to have to use - -
okay. sounds good.
"}_,_irk. camera's running six frames per second."
"okay, now, you want to put that thing down; let me review the - no, the - the time line instead of the docking procedures again? 05 23 20 33 _ okay."
"okay, gordo. we're up to 2.5 on the tunnel and still venting."
we're ready.
"go ahead, houston. *** (columbia"
everything looks good.

we're on our way.
"... give them something a little different up in there too, jack."
"roger, pete."
"okay. okay, then after that, the booster - guy he confir - he commands the burn mode."
"(laughter) okay. 07 00 02 07 lmp-i_ okay, let's go, dave."
and -
"no, i didn't, al. 05 22 h5 17 cdr ..."
