they used it three hundred years ago to go to earth and bring our ancestors back here the
you mean s
it wa
tel
thats where the stories differ somewhat to the humans hes a folk hero our liberator im sure thats what you were taught but the skagarans they call him rakhtar it means butcher he and his men burn
so they could never enslave the human
thats how they justified it m
