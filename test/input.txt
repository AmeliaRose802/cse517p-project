okay for today wed like you on p23 to make a trunnion bias determination prior to p23 sightings as called out in procedures and also one afterwards our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular readout in the sextant the bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated that is a proceed on noun 87 after you get two consecutive measure ments equal to within 0003 degrees and of course move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements the earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today im sure youre a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are but to ensure that youre getting a good angle measurement between the star and the earth horizon the sextant mline which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the rline sh

roger this trip of ours to the moon may have looked to you simple or easy id like to assure you that has ot been the case the saturn v rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery every piece of which worked flawlessly this computer up above my head has a 38 000word vocabulary each word of which has been very carefkllly chosen to be of the utmost value to us the crew this switch which i have in my hand now has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone this one single switch design in addtion to that there are myrisds of circuit brekers levers rods and other associated conrols the sps engine our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module must have performed flaw lessly or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit the parachutes up above my heaa must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plurnet into the goss net 1 tape 1143 ocean we have always ha3 confidence that all this equipment will work and work propery and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight ail this is possible only through the blood sweat and tears of a number of people first the american workmen who put these pieces of machinery to gether in the factory second the painstaking work done by the various test tem during the assembly and retest after assembly and finally the people at the manned spacecraft center both in management in mission planning in flight control and last but not least in crew training this operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine ail you see is the three of us but beneath the surface are thousands uadthou sands of others and to all those i would like to say th
