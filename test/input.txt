Así rezaba una de las obras maestras de Arturo Pérez Reverte. Un aplicable a la EDMSB en su inicio de temporada en Primera Regional. En el fútbol, como en la vida, no hay nada imposible. Todo depende de la capacidad para soñar en lo que uno realmente quiere alcanzar. Un objetivo conduce a una meta, más o menos complicada dependiendo del grado de ambición de cada uno. Y este grupo humano ha venido demostrando en las dos últimas temporadas que de eso anda muy sobrado. La bisoñez, en estos casos, se compensa con un ingrediente que nunca ha faltado en este vestuario: la ilusión. El otoño llegó hace unos días con algo de retraso tras un verano sin mucha prisa por dejarnos. Con él una plaga de lesiones provocó un 'overbooking' en la enfermería del primer equipo de la Escuela Deportiva Municipal de San Blas, que anda firmando sus primeros pinitos en la Primera Regional madrileña. Chema, que por segunda temporada consecutiva será el comandandante del barco sanblasero, hace balance de las once primeras jornadas de competición: "Está siendo un inicio de temporada un tanto irregular, en el que hemos alternado grandes partidos con otros no tan buenos. Las lesiones, sin duda, no nos están ayudando demasiado. En este aspecto creo que debemos ser pacientes. Tenemos un equipo con jugadores de mucho talento que, tarde o temprano, demostrarán toda su valía sobre el césped". En el entrenamiento se sigue palpando una ilusión desmesurada por hacer algo grande. Un estreno en Primera para un equipo joven y novato tendría a la permanencia como su único y máximo objetivo. Temporada de transición y de acoplamiento que la llaman algunos. Pero David Canet, capitán del equipo, y el resto de sus compañeros no se ponen techo. Saben que la temporada es larga y, si las lesiones les respetan, no tienen ningún tipo de miramiento para colocarse el cartel de favoritos en la pelea por subirse al tren de los equipos de arriba: "En las dos primeras jornadas, con el equipo casi al completo, demostramos que podemos mirar de tú a tú a cualquier equipo de la categoría, tal y como demostramos ante el Velilla en su casa - líder destacado de la categoría". Patri, fichaje estrella de este año procedente del Tetuán, continúa con su proceso de recuperación al igual que Carlos, sin duda el peor parado de esta lacra de infortunios. El joven delantero formado en la cantera sanblasera se rompió hace unos días el menisco y el ligamento cruzado de su rodilla izquierda, diciendo prácticamente adiós a lo que resta de temporada: "Lo estoy pasando realmente mal. Soy consciente de que no es una lesión como otra cualquiera y que tendré que hacer una buena rehabilitación para poder estar el año que viene junto al resto de mis compañeros. No obstante, no tengo ninguna duda de que volveré a vestir la camiseta de la Escuela. Cuento los días que me quedan para volver a hacer goles", afirmaba Carlos mientras presenciaba el entrenamiento de sus compañeros. En la cafetería aguarda Jesús Gutiérrez, presidente de la EDMSB que, a pesar del irregular arranque de temporada del equipo, confía plenamente en Chema y en un grupo que, como viene recalcando en las últimas fechas, se ha ganado un hueco en la historia de la Escuela estas dos últimas temporadas: "Debemos recordar que somos unos recién ascendidos y que nuestra meta debe ser la permanencia. Tenemos un grupo de chicos muy jóvenes, criados la mayoría aquí, y que han demostrado que tienen calidad y potencial de sobra para hacer grandes cosas. Dejem

Ahora Ulapa | Periódico AM | Noticias de Hidalgo, México Ahora Ulapa Desde enero pasado se alertó que ante la política de "prueba-error" implementada por el gobierno de la República, que encabeza el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, se generó resquemor social ante la indicación de establecer una Guardia Nacional cuya fase de experimentación arrojara consecuencias fatales. Este espacio expuso entonces que, la muerte y criminalización de dos hermanos a merced de soldados en la comunidad El Aserradero en Cuautepec, hechos que generaron la reacción de los lugareños, sentaba mal precedente de lo que podría resultar con una corporación de heterogénea y dudosa conformación. Algo similar ocurrió ahora en Ulapa, municipio de Tetepango, donde un joven de 22 años murió en el fuego cruzado, alcanzado por las balas que presuntamente dispararon los soldados, quienes justifican que se encontraban en un operativo contra traficantes de hidrocarburo, de los cuales no hay evidencia. Por ambos casos fueron iniciadas quejas de oficio ante la Comisión de Derechos Humanos del Estado de Hidalgo, remitidas a su similar nacional al tratarse de autoridades federales, así como carpetas de investigación en Ministerios Públicos de la Procuraduría General de Justicia para deslindar responsabilidades. El procurador de Hidalgo, Raúl Arroyo González dio a conocer el viernes pasado en Radio Fórmula que busca determinar el origen de la bala que quitó la vida al joven que transitaba por Ulapa. Hasta ese momento se habían presentado 24 militares a rendir su declaración, a quienes les retuvieron sus armas. Parece redundante decir que las fuerzas castrenses no saben conducirse frente a la población civil. Sin embargo, para los integrantes de la autonombrada Cuarta Transformación no es así, toda vez que pese al discurso que intentan radicar en el imaginario colectivo, su Guardia Nacional tendrá genética militar. En los casos mencionados la población protestó y retuvo a los militares para luego entregarlos a las autoridades correspondientes. En los últimos meses también se cuentan los hechos ocurridos en Santa Ana Ahuehuepan, Tula, donde un hombre fue asesinado luego de sostener una balacera con los uniformados. Entre las contradicciones más sonoras de Andrés Manuel López Obrador durante estos cien días, en lo que respecta a seguridad en Hidalgo, destaca su excusa por la inacción de los soldados que permitieron que cientos de personas se bañaran en gasolina el 18 de enero pasado en San Primitivo, Tlahuelilpan. Afirmó que no intervinieron para no confrontarse, para no dañar a la gente. Paradójicamente, el resultado superó los 130 muertos, además, cada que los soldados han establecido un retén o realizado un patrullaje, algún civil resulta muerto. Sobre el caso Ulapa

Páginas Inicio Crítica de Películas Ranking AleuCine Crítica de Series Noticias Especiales Lista de Películas viernes, 24 de enero de 2014 Paranormal Movie “La formula de siempre ya no funciona” FICHA TÉCNICA Año: 20 de diciembre 2013 País: Estados Unidos Duración: 1horas 39minutos Género: Comedia Presupuesto: 2 millones de dólares Recaudación: 31 millones de dólares Título: Paranormal Movie → Lo mejor: -Simplemente Marlon Wayans, el único actor con una pizca de gracia. → Lo peor: -Un reparto insulso, y unos sketch muy vistos. En este blog tenemos la fiel costumbre de celebrar fechas significativas con críticas de películas que no valen un pimiento, la primera crítica del 2014 fue para Te quiero, tío y la primera crítica después del lavado de cara del blog será para Paranormal Movie. Desde ya comentar que si es lo que pensáis, una parodia más que bebe de los vientos de todas sus hermanas (Scary Movie, Date Movie, Disaster Movie, Superhero Movie, y toda la leche que le queráis poner un Movie al final), y si los sketches son muy similares a sus familiares, tenemos ante nosotros otra copia más. Muchas escenas carecerán de gracia porque simplemente son horrible (o se interpretan realmente mal, vaya películita se marca Essence Atkins), y otras simplemente están más recalentadas que la comida en una casa de estudiantes. Solo saldrá al rescate el único valor de la película, el protagonista masculino, salvando más de un skecth.

Sin embargo El Barcelona pretende que Sergio el Kun Agüero baje a la mitad el sueldo que actualmente recibe en el Manchester City. Por su parte, Juventus le propone al Kun ser titular en un equipo que se perfila para desprenderse del español Alvaro Morata y el argentino Paulo Dybala en el próxi

No procedió la protesta de Santos por supuesto acto de racismo - El Sol de San Luis | Noticias Locales, Policiacas, sobre México, San Luis Potosí y el Mundo El zaguero ecuatoriano Félix Torres no fue agredido verbalmente por algún jugador del ADSL. / cortesía Club Santos Una vez analizadas las pruebas proporcionadas por Santos Laguna y Atlético de San Luis y de los oficiales del partido, la Comisión Disciplinaria de la Federación Mexicana de Futbol, no encontró elementos claros que demuestren que hubo un acto de racismo en contra del jugador ecuatoriano Félix Torres. Textualmente informó: 1. Después de analizar diligentemente las pruebas que se tuvieron a la vista, no se encontraron elementos que con certeza demuestren la culpabilidad de Germán Berterame, por lo tanto, esta CD (Comisión Disciplinaria) carece de elementos para sancionar al jugador. La protesta de Santos Laguna por presunto acto de racismo, no procedió ante la CD de la Femexfut. / cortesía Club Santos Por último, la Comisión Disciplinaria reiteró que rechaza categóricamente cualquier acto o conducta racista ya que no hay espacio para el racismo en el fútbol. En caso de comprobarse cualquier acto o conducta racista, será sancionado enérgicamente. La Comisión Disciplinaria ya notificó la resolución a los Clube

Mrk.Borja: Nuevo Amazon Kindle Fire HD Esto se anima, llega la Navidad y nos trae muchos juguetitos para los amantes de lo tecnológico y avanzado y es que Kindle Fire HD ya está desde hoy disponible para enviar en España. El Kindle Fire HD se presenta en tamaños de 7 y 8.9 pulgadas, con mejoras en el hardware, el software y especialmente en la pantalla, donde hay que destacar los datos del modelo de 8.9 pulgadas con una genial resolución de 1920×1200 píxeles que dan 254 dpi (puntos por pulgada, una medida cada vez más común a la hora de medir las resoluciones). Pasemos a ver con detalle las características técnicas de estos nuevos Kindle Fire HD. Nuevos Kindle Fire HD, características técnicas La base de los nuevos Kindle Fire HD es común en los modelos de 7 y 8.9 pulgadas. Estos tablets cuentan con un procesador de doble núcleo Texas Instruments OMAP 4470 (que según Amazon mejora el rendimiento de Tegra 3 en un 50%) a 1.5 Ghz (el modelo de 7 pulgadas se queda en un 4460 a 1.2 Ghz) y tecnología de doble banda (5 y 2.4 Ghz) MIMO que mejorará la señal. Según la compañía consiguen tasas de transferencias un 41 y 54% mejores que iPad 3 y Nexus 7. Kindle Fire HD también tendrá Bluetooth y salida HDMI El modelo básico parte de los 16 GB de capacidad interna debido a que Amazon quiere potenciar el consumo de contenido en alta definición, y hay también de 32 y 64 GB. En cuanto a las pantallas, la resolución del modelo de 7 pulgadas es de 1280 × 800 píxeles y viene con filtro polarizado y tecnología antirreflectante. El Kindle Fire HD de 8.9 pulgadas sube su apuesta hasta los 1080p en resolución, con panel IPS y táctil de hasta 10 puntos. El Amazon Kindle HD de 8.9 pulgadas se presenta con un grosor de sólo 8.8 milímetros y peso de unos 567 gramos aproximadamente, mientras que el de 7 pulgadas tiene unas dimensiones oficiales de 19.3 × 13.7 × 10.3 cm, con un peso de 395 gramos. Amazon Kindle Fire HD de 8.9 pulgadas En el apartado del audio, olvidado según Amazon por muchos fabricantes, el Kindle Fire HD será estéreo y contará con la certificación Dolby Digital Plus, posiblemente pensando en ofrecer una calidad de sonido superior de cara a su tienda de música. En EEUU contarán con un modelo de Kindle Fire HD de 8.9 pulgadas con conectividad LTE, que con un pago de 50 dólares una vez, te garantiza 250 MB de datos al mes para siempre. La idea no es mala, pero esa cifra es ridícula para un tablet con aspiraciones de consumidor de contenido. Nuevo software para Kindle Fire Aprovechando el nuevo hardware y su tienda de aplicaciones propia, Amazon ha anunciado la inclusión de nuevo software: Skype, la conocida aplicación de videoconferencia llega a los Fire y será compatible con la cámara frontal en HD. WhisperSync, una aplicación que permitirá sincronizar y guardar las partidas de los videojuegos en 'la nube', de forma que en cualquier momento se podrán recuperar. Nueva aplicación de correo electrónico Nueva aplicación de Facebook específica para los Fire Kindle FreeTime, para limitar el tiempo de juego en los niños. Algo así como un control parental qu

Conservadores se van con Vargas Lleras – El Artículo El candidato Germán Vargas Lleras sumó el respaldo del Partido Conservador, luego de la votación de la junta de parlamentarios que decidió entre respaldarlo a él o al candidato uribista Iván Duque. Finalmente, con una mayoría de 32 votos contra 21, los congresistas azules se inclinaron por un acuerdo programático con la campaña Mejor Vargas Lleras. Tras la decisión, el exvicepresidente queda ahora con el apoyo, al menos oficial, de los conservadores y el Partido de La U. Sin embargo, congresistas del partido explicaron que la decisión tiene peso netamente político lo cual significa que no será de obligatorio cumplimiento para los militantes, que podrán apoyar otras aspiraciones. A través de un sistema de voto en urna, los integrantes de la junta parlamentaria (actuales congresistas y aquellos que resultaron electos el pasado 11 de marzo), manifestaron sus posici

Pero hacia septiembre todavía esperaban ser convocados. "Originalmente la rúbrica se realizaría antes de que finalice el mes de agosto, pero claramente se ha demorado", expresaba el titular de FACE en diálogo con APF.

Por Cristián Meza 4 de Mayo, 2021 › 23:23 hrs En la oportunidad, el reconocido intérprete de películas de acción y artes marciales le hizo entrega de una espada samurái. Nicolás Maduro recibió en el Palacio de Miraflores de Caracas al conocido actor Steven Seagal, quien visitó Venezuela en su rol de representante especial del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Rusia. En la oportunidad, el reconocido intérprete de películas de acción y artes marciales le hizo entrega de una espada samurái, lo que fue reconocido por el gobernante. "Complacido de recibir la grata visita del actor estadounidense, Steven Seagal. Sin duda alguna, Steven no es solo uno de los grandes del cine, también, es un dedicado luchador por la Paz de los pueblos. ¡Bienvenido!", indicó Maduro en redes sociales. Junto con ello, celebró el obsequio, planteando que la espada de origen japonés es un "símbolo de liderazgo. La recibí con mucha emoción de parte de un gran maestro y experto en artes marciales. ¡Qué Gran Honor!".

María Elvira Rodríguez Herrer nueva presidenta del Grupo Tragsa | Tragsa María Elvira Rodríguez Herrer nombrada presidenta del Grupo Tragsa ​La ex presidenta de la CNMV se convierte en la segunda mujer al frente de esta empresa pública en sus cuarenta años de historia La Junta General Extraordinaria de Accionistas ha designado como presidenta del Grupo Tragsa a María Elvira Rodríguez Herrer. Esta madrileña de 67 años, es Licenciada en Ciencias Económicas y Comerciales por la Universidad Complutense de Madrid e interventora de Hacienda, y fue una de las primeras mujeres auditora del Estado. La nueva presidenta ha manifestado su satisfacción por incorporarse a una empresa pública con más de 40 años al servicio de las Administraciones, a las que conoce muy bien, ya que a lo largo de su carrera ha ocupado numerosos cargos en la Administración, destacando su etapa como ministra de Medio Ambiente entre 2003 y 2004. Además, ha sido directora general de Presupuestos del Ministerio de Economía y Hacienda, secretaria de estado de Presupuestos y Gastos del Ministerio de Hacienda (1996-2000), consejera de Transportes de la Comunidad de Madrid (2006-2007) y presidenta de la Comisión de Economía y Competitividad en el Co

La licencia social de un candidato Nombres de decenas de precandidatos a los gobiernos locales y al gobierno regional se vienen escuchando estos últimos días, más allá de cualquier valoración considero que cualquier aspirante a cargo público debería tener lo que denomino "licencia social" para postular en las próximas elecciones. La "licencia social" pasa a ser ese elemento constitutivo de quien aspira alcanzar un cargo de elección popular además de ser sinónimo de vocación de servicio, podríamos coincidir que cualquier ánimo de trabajar desinteresadamente por su comunidad tiene que haberse mostrado en momentos previos a un proceso electoral. Así pues la "licencia social" vendría a ser la preocupación que muestra un ciudadano común y corriente para tener la cualidad de postulante a cargo público, lo que en buen romance sería el haber mostrado preocupación por la administración pública desde el lugar en que se encuentre, entendiéndose por ello fiscalizar, proponer, aportar, criticar. Si somos conscientes que somos parte de un sistema electoral donde los partidos o agrupaciones políticas son coyunturales, se encuentra en nuestras manos evitar que también tengamos candidatos coyunturales. Observando a nuestros pre candidatos fácilmente llegaremos a la conclusión que muy pocos tienen "licencia social"; la mayoría cree que por tener algo de dinero puede acceder a un cargo público, aunque valgan verdades, uno podría sospechar para qué postulan. Ello nos podría ayudar a descartar a tanto oportunista y candidato coyuntural, bastaría preguntarles cuándo y cuáles han sido sus aportes como ciudadanos a las políticas de gobierno locales y/o regionales a lo largo de los años, cuándo levantaron su voz para cuestionar o fiscalizar presuntos actos de corrupción, cuándo criticaron la incapacidad o incompetencia de nuestras autoridades o a las mismas gestiones, cuándo aportaron ideas o propuestas para el desarrollo de sus pueblos. Este ejercicio práctico nos podría ayudar a eliminar a un gran porcentaje de aspirantes, resulta claro que no se trata de tener más dinero o que nuestro club de amigos nos digan al oído que tenemos aceptación como postulante, ese es uno de los factores que determinan que no tengamos postulantes con raigambre y sintonía social que nos permita avizorar una propuesta que armonice con los intereses de la población. Ese escenario perverso ocasiona que alguien sin recursos para "invertir" en campaña no tenga la posibilidad de intentar una postulación porque las experiencias nos indican que desde el saque necesitaremos un presupuesto exorbitante. Claro que hay excepciones admirables y ejemplificantes, pero son los menos y sin lugar a dudas tendrán sus chances m

"En Unión no tengo reconocimiento" : : El Litoral - Noticias - Santa Fe - Argentina - ellitoral.com : : Lunes 01.06.2020 - Última actualización - 12:27 El Turco Alí, máximo goleador de la historia tatengue... El Turco también se refirió a su relación con Nery Pumpido: "No es de la mejor forma posible, pero sí de mucho respeto y saludo. Nos debemos un café. Pasamos muchas cosas juntos", señaló uno de los ídolos rojiblancos. Fernando Alí, el popular Turco, cuando ya era entrenador y dirigía a Unión. Ese equipo del 2009-2010 hizo una muy buena primera rueda pero se "pinchó" en la segunda. Fernando Alí, el popular Turco, cuando ya era entrenador y dirigía a Unión. Ese equipo del 2009-2010 hizo una muy buena primera rueda pero se "pinchó" en la segunda. Crédito: Mauricio Garin El Turco Alí, máximo goleador de la historia tatengue... "En Unión no tengo reconocimiento" El Turco también se refirió a su relación con Nery Pumpido: "No es de la mejor forma posible, pero sí de mucho respeto y saludo. Nos debemos un café. Pasamos muchas cosas juntos", señaló uno de los ídolos rojiblancos. El Turco también se refirió a su relación con Nery Pumpido: "No es de la mejor forma posible, pero sí de mucho respeto y saludo. Nos debemos un café. Pasamos muchas cosas juntos", señaló uno de los ídolos rojiblancos. Hace unos días El Litoral recordaba aquella gira que Unión realizó en 1981 por Europa. Disputó un torneo en España y luego hizo un entrenamiento en el Santiago Bernabeu. En aquella oportunidad, el Turco Alí no participó pero fue porque justo en ese momento había sido transferido al Valladolid. Y a fuerza de ser sinceros y bien viene la aclaración, aquella venta del Turco propició la realización de esa gira histórica por el Viejo Continente que hizo el plantel que, por entonces, dirigía Carmelo Faraone. El Turco Alí, máximo goleador de la historia de Unión, fue entrevistado por el colega Emiliano Nunia en Villa Trinidad y puso de manifiesto toda su sinceridad sobre algunos temas que tienen que ver con la historia tatengue. Protagonista de la final de 1979, cuando Unión empató los dos partidos con River pero fue segundo porque River marcó un gol de visitante en el 15 de Abril, entiende que ese partido fue el más importante de la historia de Unión, colocándolo por encima de la final de 1989 ante Colón por el ascenso a Primera. Al igual que lo que declaró Víctor Alfredo Bottaniz a El Litoral, Alí también se refirió a la falta de reconocimiento. "No tengo el reconocimiento que a lo mejor se le hace a otros ex jugadores en otros clubes. No somos consultados como deberíamos ser y tampoco tenemos ese 'mimo' que deberíamos tener", dijo el hombre que, con su

Paquete Castilla: Empresas podrán reducir sus deudas hasta diciembre | ECONOMIA | PERU21 Paquete Castilla: Empresas podrán reducir sus deudas hasta diciembre El Ejecutivo envió al Congreso el proyecto de ley de contrataciones del Estado, el de medidas tributarias y la norma sobre las garantías mobiliarias. En manos del Congreso quedaron las medidas, que además cambian las fuentes de financiamiento de las fiscalizadoras. (Nancy Dueñas) Actualizado el 20/06/2014 07:05 a.m. Gustavo Martínez (gustavo.martinez@peru21)La mañana del jueves, el Poder Ejecutivo envió al Congreso el denominado paquete Castilla que incluye tres proyectos de ley. Entre las iniciativas, que tienen carácter de urgente, se encuentra la ley con medidas tributarias y que busca dinamizar la inversión, la de contrataciones del Estado y la de garantías mobiliarias. Asimismo, el Ejecutivo establece reemplazar la metodología de cálculo por la aplicación de una tasa nominal, a fin de uniformizar los intereses. Sin embargo, para acogerse a este nuevo procedimiento los deudores deberán desistir de los medios impugnatorios que tengan sobre el monto de la deuda. "

Este chico es un demonio: despiden a Gilbert Gottfried por hacer bromas sobre Japón en Twitter - Cooking Ideas Este chico es un demonio: despiden a Gilbert Gottfried por hacer bromas sobre Japón en Twitter «Japón es realmente avanzado. Ellos no van a la playa. La playa va a ellos». El actor Gilbert Gottfried Gilbert Gottfried no es Nacho Vigalondo; es más alto y se dedica desde hace mucho más al mundillo del vodevil. Y, de vez en cuando, también a soltar perlitas geoestratégicas en Twitter. Este eterno actor secundario norteamericano (que siempre recordaré por hacer de malo en la primer de "Este chico es un demonio") ha visto como de repente su cara aparece en todos los trendings del odio mundial, al ser despedido fulminantemente de Aflac Inc., la compañía que le tenía contratado desde principios de siglo para dotar de voz al «pato Aflac". El pato Aflac es un ganso que, al igual que el erizo de Génesis, se encarga dar la barrila en los spots a los posibles clientes de esta aseguradora norteamericana. Lástima que también de la casualidad que esta aseguradora tenga el 75% de su negocio en Japón y que se esté preparando para una avalancha de reclamaciones, que a buen seguro va a dejar al patito tiritando y sin plumas. Michael Zuna, director de la aseguradora declaró, después de mandarle el finiquito en un sobre pequeño, que los recientes comentarios de Gilbert sobre la crisis en Japón carecían de humor y, ciertamente, no representaban los pensamientos y los sentimientos de cualquier persona que trabaja Aflac. Ni siquiera la de su pato. "No hay lugar lugar para otra cosa que no sea compasión y preocupación durante estos tiempos difíciles" sentenció dando carpetazo de Dior al asunto. Y es que Gilbert Gottfried no sólo soltó la astracanada que encabeza este post, sino también tres más que se unen a una serie que ya se ha convertido por derecho pro

Este es un pastel muy especial y socorrido en fiestas, reuniones especiales, etc. Me gusta mucho prepararlo porque no hay como la combinacion de pastel de chocolate y flan en un solo postre que se hace a baño María. De pensarlo hasta me dan ganas de ir a hacer otro enseguida! El Chocoflan también se conoce como "pastel imposible" y es un postre originario de México. A pesar del miedo que provoca el prepararlo, les aseguro que no es difícil. Para este postre, les sere franca, la parte del pastel de chocolate la hago con cajita preparada, porque ahorra tiempo y queda con la humedad necesaria y el balance perfecto con el flan. Asi lo he hecho siempre y como siempre tengo resultados perfectos, prefiero no hechar a perder esa reputacion que tiene en mi familia y amigos. El flan, ese si es mi receta de flan con ricotta, porque me gusta la cremosidad que adquiere. No se porque nunca habia publicado la receta, pero como ultimamente me la han pedido mis amigas, decidí que en la siguiente oportunidad que lo preparara le tomaria fotos al proceso y la escribiria como debe ser. Además es perfecta para las fiestas y posadas de Navidad, digo, quien puede resistirse a este postre, con esa combinacion? Debo hacer otra aclaración, lo normal es que en la base del molde se cubra con cajeta que muchos de ustedes conocen como dulce de leche. Como no vivo en México y aquí no consigo una cajeta estilo mexicano que me guste, mejor hago mi caramelo. Pueden sustituir y hacer ya sea con cajeta o caramelo sin problemas. pero si tengo que decir que prefiero el caramelo de todos modos, porque con la cajeta puede quedar muy empalagoso. 1.- Tome un molde de 10 pulgadas de diámetro de anillo desmoldable para pastel y lo cubrí por fuera de la base con papel aluminio, que proteja bien las paredes. 2.- Hacer el caramelo en una olla, agregamos el azúcar a flama media alta y vamos dejando que se derrita, moviendo muy de vez en cuando con una pala de madera, que el caramelo tenga un color ámbar y que toda el azúcar este completamente fundida, no debemos dejar que se queme. 3.- Vertimos el caramelo inmediatamente que esta listo en un molde para pastel de 10 pulgadas previamente engrasado ligeramente de las paredes del molde (yo uso de anillo desmoldable). Le vamos dando vueltas inclinándolo con cuidado para que el caramelo cubra todo el fondo y lo dejamos enfriar. 5.- Ponemos todos los ingredientes del pastel en la batidora, siguiendo las indicaciones del paquete y batimos hasta obtener una mezcla homogenea. 1.- Tomamos una charola gruesa grande para horno, que el molde del pastel quepa dentro y que tenga una profundidad para que al agregar el agua, le llegue con comodidad a la mitad de la altura del molde del pastel cuando este dentro de el. Precalentamos el horno a 180°C (350°F). También tenemos que tener lista agua hirviendo, la suficiente. 2.- Vaciamos en el molde, sobre el caramelo la mezcla del pastel y luego la del flan con cuidado. No te preocupes si se mezclan, a la hora del horneado se separaran las mezclas, por eso le llaman pastel imposible. 3.- Colocamos el molde con las mezclas en nuestra charola y aquí depende de como sientas el peso puedes hacer dos cosas. Una opción es meter la charola al horno y jalar un poco la rejilla donde la coloraras para verter el agua hirviendo con cuidado de que no salpique ni le caiga a la mezcla del pastel. Recuerda que el agua debe llegar a la mitad de la altura de la pared del molde del pastel. La otra opción es que antes de meter la charola al horno, viertas el agua hirviendo con cuidado y luego la pongas en el horno. Pero con el agua a veces la charola se hace muy pesada y es muy fácil tener un accidente y quemarte con el agua caliente. Tu decide que es mas fácil y toma precauciones. 4.- Deja el pastel a baño María en el horno por 1 hora y revisa, si al introducir un palillo en el centro sale limpio, el pastel esta listo. Las masas se separan al hornearse y el flan queda abajo y el pastel arriba. 5.- Saca del horno y de la charola con cuidado y deja enfriar por completo sin desmoldar. Me gusta meterlo al refrigerador cuando se enfría por unas horas y luego a la hora de servirlo lo volteas sobre un platón grande con cuidado y quitas el anillo. El pastel queda abajo al desmoldar y el flan arriba y toda la salsa de caramelo lo va a bañar. Ahora si que esta sintiéndose el aire bastante helado. Tuvimos muchisimas lluvias y vientos, con lo cual se cayeron bastantes hojas de los arboles. Así, lloviendo no se puede avanzar con la limpieza otoñal del jardín, pero el sábado vimos que el domingo haria sol y me dijo mi marido: "Ya sabes lo que tenemos que hacer mañana verdad?" . Pues si, resignacion, tendremos que trabajar todo el dia afuera y juntar lo mas posible de hojas. Así que decidi prepararme y desde el sábado prepare una olla grande de caldo tlalpeño, para no tener que preocuparme el domingo y nada mas terminar la faena, entrar y calentarlo. Fue muy buena idea porque entramos helados y cansados, francamente sin ganas de cocinar y con los brazos adoloridos. Ya nada mas era alistar unas cuantas cositas mas que ponerle al plato una vez servido. Aquí donde vivo no se consigue el epazote, que es una hierba que le da un sabor muy bueno a la comida y que se usa mucho en Mexico, así que sustituí por cilantro. Creanme que después de todo ese trabajo, fue la gloria. 1.- Hacer caldo con el pollo, cociendo las pechugas en agua suficiente a que las cubra con ajos, cebolla, apio, laurel, consomé o sal al gusto. Cocinarlas por 20 - 30 minutos o hasta que la carne este cocida. Retirar con una cuchara la espuma de vez en cuando. 2.- Sacar el pollo del caldo y deshebrarlo, reservamos y colamos el caldo que reservamos también deshechando lo demás. 3.- Mientras que el caldo se esta haciendo, en un sartén o comal con una cucharadita de aceite vegetal tostamos los tomates y el tomatillo y los licuamos, colamos y reservamos. Si no tienes tomatillo puedes usar solo tomates. 4.- Ponemos el caldo colado en una olla a fuego medio y agregamos la zanahoria y la calabacita picadas en cuadritos, el puré de tomate y dejamos que se cueza por unos 15 minutos o hasta que las verduras esten al dente. Rectificamos la sal. 6.- El caldo se sirve muy caliente con aguacate y fresco picado encima, chile chipotle al gusto (si gustas), limones partidos para que cada quien le ponga al gusto y tostitos o tortillas de maíz. Yo ademas les puse arroz blanco cocido en un lado en el caldo, no es la costumbre pero a nosotros asi nos gusta. Que mal he andado por el blog de recetas, no he tenido tiempo de editar. He cocinado y horneado muchas cosas, pero me ha faltado tiempo para hacerlo todo. Los dias no me rinden ultimamente como quisiera. Pero aqui vengo con otra receta mas de manzanas y ademas con peras. Tengo una amiga que tiene un peral en el patio de su casa (muy afortunada!) y me compartio bastantes peras. Con ellas y las muchisimas manzanas hice Mantequilla de Manzana y Pera. Si quieres ver como, puedes dar clic al enlace de Mantequilla de Manzana en Olla de Cocimiento Lento, lo unico diferente es que 2/3 partes eran manzana y 1/3 parte era pera. Quedo riquisima para untar y una buena parte la use para un pastel y para este flan, que queria que fuera muy especial. El flan fue para celebrar el baby shower de una amiga que esta por tener a su beba. Que mejor forma de festejar que con un postre especial. 1.- Lo primero es forrar un molde de esos de anillo desmoldable con papel aluminio por fuera y tener a la mano listos una charola grande donde quepa el molde y profunda para poner en baño María el flan. También hay que tener lista agua hiviendo. Mi molde es de 9 pulgadas o 23 cm de diámetro. 2.- Hacer el caramelo añadiendo en una olla anti adherente el azúcar a temperatura alta y dejar que se vaya derritiendo. Cuando se derrita todo muevo un poco con una cuchara de palo y sin dejar de vigilarlo porque se puede quemar. A mi no me gusta tan oscuro, solo lo dejo hasta que tiene un color a miel. Luego lo vacías rápidamente en el molde y lo mueves para cubrir todo el fondo y lo dejas enfriar. Lamento no mostrar todo, porque tienes que hacerlo rápido antes que se enfríe y no tenia a alguien mas que tomara las fotos. 3.- Poner en la procesadora la mantequilla o pure de manzana y pera, y procesar o moler para que la mezcla quede lo mas suave y terza posible. 5.- Vaciar sobre el el caramelo en el molde y meter a bano maria (que el agua caliente que viertas en la charola le llegue por fuera a la mitad de la altura del molde del flan, en horno precalentado a 180 C por 60-75 minutos o hasta que al insertar un palillo en el centro salga limpio. 6.- Sacar con cuidado, dejar que enfrie fuera del agua y refrigerar por unas horas o un dia antes y luego desmoldar con cuidado sobre un platon. Para adornar, pele y corte en rebanadas la manzana y pera. Puse en un sarten caliente la mantequilla y el azucar morena y agregue las rebanadas de la fruta, bajar a fuego medio. Mover de vez en cuando y cocinar hasta que la fruta este blandita. Dejar que enfrien y adornar con ellas el flan. Seguimos con las manzanas! Uff es que con tantas, me he visto haciendo mucho postre para aprovechar, además una amiga también me llevo peras de su árbol, así que proximamente verán por aquí también recetas con peras. Bueno, la tome de ahi pero de hice algunas modificaciones para hacerlo a mi estilo. Yo siempre ando intentando reducir las cantidades de azúcar de todo lo que horneo y cocino, además me gusta mas como quedan los pasteles con aceite que con mantequilla, no se, cuestión de gustos. Pero la receta les gusto muchisimo en casa y se termino muy rapido! Se ha convertido en un clásico muy rápido que voy a estar repitiendo seguido, con o sin frosting. Lo único que le falto fueron las nueces, que tristemente tengo que evitar por las alergias al cacahuate y nueces de árbol que tiene mi hija, si no fuera por eso le hubiera puesto nuez pecana. 2.- Para hacer la masa del pastel: Mezcla todos los ingredientes excepto las manzanas y nueces en un tazón grande, bate a velocidad baja hasta que este todo integrada. la masa quedara muy espesa e incluso con aspecto migajoso. 3.- Agrega la manzana en cuadritos y si quieres las nueces. Mezcla a velocidad media con la batidora por 3 o 5 minutos o hasta que las manzanas suelte un poco de su jugo y quede con textura tipo masa de brownie. 5.- Hornea por 45 minutos o hasta que al insertar un palillo en el centro salga limpio o con poquitas migajas pegadas (el mio salio limpio). 6.- Saca el pastel del horno y deja enfriar sobre una rejilla mientras haces el frosting. No desmoldes el pastel. 7.- Para hacer el frosting: Derrite la mantequilla en una olla pequeña a fuego medio y agrega el azúcar morena y sal, cocinando hasta que el azúcar se derrita. 8.- Agrega a la olla la leche y sigue calentando hasta que hierva y pasa lo a otro tazón para que se enfrie por 10 minutos. 9.- Pasado ese tiempo agrega el azúcar glass y vainilla mezclando bien. Si la mezcla se ve muy delgada agrega mas azúcar glass (yo no tuve que agregar mas). 10.- Vacía el frosting tibio sobre el pastel alisando la superficie con una espátula. Corta en cuadritos y sirve tibio o a temperatura ambiente. 11.- Puedes guardar el pastel tapado a temperatura ambiente por varios días o congelar. Pero yo mejor lo metí al refrigerador bien tapado. Cada vez que lo sacaba, solo lo calentaba unos segundos en el micro. Este fin de semana pasado fuimos a una granja que me habían recomendado mucho. es una granja que queda a escasos 7 minutos en carro de mi casa, en esta zona a media hora de Albany, la capital de NY, hay muchas. Y claro, en esta temporada todas las granjas están de fiesta por la cosecha y todas tienen no solo los productos que ofrecerte, sino una serie de actividades y diversiones para toda la familia. Desde recoger manzanas o calabazas, meterte a un laberinto de maizales, pasear en caballo o pony, acariciar y darles de comer a los animales, etc. Esta granja en concreto se llama "Bowman's Orchards" y es famosa por su enorme cantidad y variedad de manzanas. Aquí el chiste es llevarte tus bolsas e ir con la familia a recoger tus propias manzanas. Pero son muchos lotes, incluso te dan un mapa para que sepas donde esta el tipo de manzana que buscas y de cuales lineas de arboles puedes recoger, todas numeradas cuidadosamente y con listones de colores para que no te confundas. Pues bien, decidimos ir y con el bonus de que te dejan llevar a tu perro, pues mas animados para pasear a la chucha. Pero que fila para entrar, nada mas al estacionamiento, Dios mio! En sábado parecía que todo Nueva York había decidido ir a esa granja. Duramos bastante para poder entrar al estacionamiento, estacionarnos y luego bajar por las frutas. No tenia idea de cuanta gente iba a estar ahí. Familias completas que tienen la tradición de cada año ir por sus manzanas y vaya que la granja esta enorme. Y bueno, pues ahí nos tienen, probando y poniendo en la bolsa emocionados, que ya cuando llegamos a la salida para que nos pesaran la bolsa eran demasiadas, uff! Creo que vamos a estar a dieta de manzana por dos meses, se los juro, jajajaja! Voy a ponerme a hacer todo de manzana. Entonces, para empezar a darle uso a tanta manzana, decidí hacer un volteado. Pero a diferencia del volteado de piña o de fresa que ya he preparado en otras ocasiones, la manzana en mi opinión necesita de estar un poco mas blandita y ayudarle a darle un poco de mas sabor con una suave salsa de caramelo. Además utilice buttermilk (suero de leche) y a la harina le agregue maizena a la hora de cernirla, para obtener un resultado un poco mas suave como si fuera harina pastelera. También reduje un huevo de la receta que siempre hago, en fin que salio un pastel delicioso y les aseguro que desapareció por completo casi el mismo día. Así que no se sorprendan si ven muchas recetas de manzana por estos días, porque tendré que aprovecharlas todas, que aquí nunca se desperdicia nada. 1.- Cortar 3 de las manzanas a la mitad y luego en rebanadas no muy gruesas, la otra manzana la cortamos en cuadritos pequeños y la reservamos. Luego ponemos la mantequilla a calentar en un cazo y le agregamos el 1/4 de taza de azúcar y el azúcar morena y 1/2 cucharadita de canela que se derrita un poco. Luego agregamos las rebanadas de manzana y mezclamos con cuidado y agregamos una cucharadita de agua. Dejamos solo a que la manzana se ablande un poco y apagamos. Aqui lamento que me falto una foto. Escurrimos con cuidado las rebanadas de manzana, pero reservamos el rico jarabe que queda. Acomodamos las rebanadas en el fondo del molde. Tratar que sea muy poco el liquido de las manzanas porque si no, no se cocera bien el pastel. 3.- En un tazón aparte, batimos el resto del azúcar con el aceite a velocidad alta y hasta tener una mezcla homogenea. 8.- Sacamos del horno y dejamos enfriar por 5 minutos, luego lo volteamos y desmoldamos con cuidado. Bañamos con la salsa de caramelo por encima y servimos. Continuamos con las recetas mexicanas del mes. Cada vez que vamos de visita a México, mi mama y mi suegra se lucen en la cocina, consintiéndonos con platillos de los que solo ellas pueden preparar. Pero este verano tuve a mis suegros de visita con nosotros y mi suegra nos deleito con su famoso estofado de cerdo. Le queda sensacional y pude ver y registrar con fotos el paso a paso. 1.- Cortar la cebolla y tomate primero a la mitad y luego en rebanadas delgadas. Calentar una olla profunda con aceite v

Elyas Machera | La Rueda del Tiempo Wiki | FANDOM powered by Wikia Hombres, Nacionalidad desconocida, Guardianes Primera aparición EODM 23 Última aparición URDL 40 Nombre completo Elyas Machera Alias Diente Largo Nacimiento ca. 943 NE Rango Hermano Lobo Afiliación Lobos Complexión Enjuto Pelo Castaño salpicado de canas Ojos Amarillos-dorados Rina Hafden (Aes Sedai) "Tarde o temprano siempre hay problemas cuando hay dos humanos cerca." Elyas Machera es un hombre maduro que ha decidido cortar todos los lazos con su vida anterior tras descubrir que es un Hermano Lobo y que puede comunicarse con los lobos. Ha evitado durante largo tiempo al resto de humanos y ha vivido los últimos años en compañía de estos animales en territorios salvajes, lo que ha incrementado aún más sus habilidades de supervivencia. En el lenguaje de sensaciones, olores e imágenes de los lobos, Elyas es llamado Diente Largo, por el cuchillo con el que siempre va armado. Es probable que Elyas supere los cincuenta años de edad, ya que en Nueva Primavera es un hombre joven, de complexión musculosa, hombros anchos y barba corta. Después de haber vivido al raso los últimos quince años y en compañía de los lobos, su aspecto ha desmejorado notablemente, su cuerpo es ahora más flaco y enjuto que en sus días de juventud y se ha vuelto más desastrado. Actualmente su pelo sigue siendo castaño aunque con varias canas, y lo lleva largo hasta la cintura y recogido en una coleta. También se ha dejado la barba larga, hirsuta e igualmente canosa. Viste enteramente con pieles, con un característico gorro de formas redondeadas y siempre lleva consigo un cuchillo, arco y flechas. Mas el rasgo distintivo por excelencia de Elyas Machera son sus ojos, de un sorprendente color amarillo-dorado que desconciertan y atemorizan a todo aquél que lo contempla por primera vez, hasta el punto de que algunos llegan a creer que se trata de un taimado Engendro de la Sombra. Elyas en su juventud Ya en la Guerra de Aiel Elyas Machera era uno de los Guardianes de la Aes Sedai del Ajah Verde Rina Hafden, junto a Waylin. Ambos hombres entrenaban juntos y eran considerados prometedores Gaidin, muy adecuados para una Aes Sedai joven como Rina. Las habilidades de Elyas en la espada eran tan buenas que llegó a entrenar a un joven Lan Mandragoran, después de que éste fuera vinculado por Moraine Damodred. Sin embargo, la vida de Elyas como Guardián de Rina tocó a su fin en torno al año 983 NE, cuando empezó a manifestar extrañas habilidades de las que no se tenía constancia en la Torre Blanca. Elyas comprendió más tarde que era un Hermano Lobo, que podía vivir, sentir y entenderse con los lobos y que debía aprender a aceptar esta dualidad entre humano y bestia. Cuando resultó patente por el color de sus ojos el cambio que se había operado en Elyas, el Ajah Rojo lo acusó injustamente de poder encauzar el Poder Único y trató de detenerlo, encerrarlo y amansarlo. Éste, en legítima defensa, mató a varios Guardianes y escapó de la Torre para nunca más regresar. La muerte de los otros Gaidin es un triste suceso que Elyas aún recuerda con pesar, mas no se arrepiente de lo hecho y no quiere volver a tener nada que ver con las Aes Sedai. Tras este suceso, se sabe que vivió un tiempo en Saldaea con una mujer llamada Merya y más tarde se retiró a las tierras agrestes a vivir acompañado por su propia manada de lobos. Durante todo este tiempo ha seguido existiendo el vínculo entre Elyas y Rina, mas ésta lo ha enmascarado y, que se sepa, no ha vuelto a establecer contacto con su Guardián. Elyas se traslada por las zonas escasamente pobladas del norte de Andor junto a una manada de lobos en la que se encuentran su líder, Moteado, y otros miembros como Quemado, Saltador y Viento cuando se topan con la pista de dos chicos jóvenes a todas luces perdidos. Al cabo de dos días de vigilancia, Elyas opta por mostrarse ante Perrin Aybara y Egwene al'Vere y les ofrece compartir su cena junto al fuego. Los dos muchachos aceptan agradecidos el buen trato de Elyas, aunque el desconcierto que sienten al ver a los lobos y conocer la historia de aquel extraño hombre es más que evidente. Elyas se muestra amistoso con ellos y no sólo les cuenta a rasgos generales sus andanzas sino que no se molesta cuando queda claro que la historia de Perrin y Egwene no es del todo cierta, y así se lo comunican los lobos. Los dos chicos han de llegar cuanto antes a Caemlyn, donde esperan reunirse con los amigos de los que se separaron accidentalmente unos días atrás, así que Elyas decide ayudarles y guiarles de vuelta a los caminos principales. Perrin y Egwene junto a Elyas y los lobos El Hermano Lobo explica a Perrin y Egwene que la capacidad de comunicarse con los lobos es muy antigua, aún más que las Aes Sedai, una habilidad que proviene de la noche de los tiempos que parece estar resurgiendo. Ante la estupefacción de los dos jóvenes, Elyas revela que los lobos han identificado a Perrin como una persona que también puede llegar a convertirse en Hermano Lobo. El muchacho de Campo de Emond se niega a creer al nómada, pero al cabo de unos días, y muy a su pesar, sus ojos empiezan a adquirir el tinte dorado y experimenta una metamorfosis interior que, con el tiempo, le p

Pentium, P.I (Politically Incorrect): Jesucristo es mi señor Jesucristo está en todas partes....en el canto de los pájaros..en el azul del cielo...en el buen vecino que ayuda a las viejitas a cruzar las calles. Jesucristo no está con los ladrones, con los violadores, los drogradictos, los aumentos en la gasolina y la Calle de la Amargura... Estamos mal. Pero la solución a estos males de la patria no está en la educación, en un cambio de actitud, ni mucho menos en una reforma a las leyes que benefician a los "malos" y hunden a los "buenos". No. La solución es el convertir a Jesucristo en Señor de Costa Rica!! Un proyecto de Ley presentado por 26 payasos del circo nacional, digo, diputados de la Asmablea Legislativa pretende convertir a Jesucristo en señor del país, pues "la persona de Jesucristo es elemento de unidad nacional al ser los habitantes de este país en su inmensa mayoría cristianos" (Al Dia. Nacionales. 10 de setiembre). Claro!! es que no era ciencia china!! Como nadie lo pensó antes?? Es que el dia que Jesucristo sea coronado nuestro señor soberano tanto en el espacio aereo, maritimo y terrestre, ese dia, como por arte de magia, se acabarán todos los problemas que nos están carcomiendo!!! Porque entonces la gente, antes de delinquir, de robarse la plata, de agredir, de violar, de matar; va a decir: "no! Jesucristo es nuestro señor y nos está viendo. Entonces mejor me porto bien!!" Y por arte de magia, dejarán de haber aumentos, los diputados trabajarán y todo el mundo actuará como siempre debió de actuar!!" ¡Qué sencillo es lavarse las manos y dejar todo en manos de Dios y "sus familiares"! ¡Qué fácil es delegarle las responsabilidades a los poderes divinos e ignorar el poder de discernimiento y libre alberdrío que se nos fue concedido!!! Una más de las maravillosas ideas de nuestro "padre patrios", por los cuales serán recordados con el pasar del tiempo. Parece que acaban de deshauciar a la Virgen de los Angeles...la pobre no pudo hacer nada por nosotros.... Publicadas por Pentium III de 750 MHZ a la/s 9/11/2005 02:32:00 p. m. oops. spamean tu blog, amiga. Pon word verification. :) Ridiculo el caso que relatas. Ignoraba el dato. Justo lo que el pais necesitaba: menos separacion entre religion y estado. deberian nuestros diputados ponerse a trabajar en proyectos practicos y de sentido comun. con resultados visibles a corto y mediano plazo. Creo que eso seria pedirles demasiado. :rolleyes: Estoy a favor de la tolerancia religiosa, todo el mundo tiene derecho a creer en lo q quiera, pero cuando vi esto, no pude + q pensar: Q VIEJOS + RIDICULOS!!!!! No puede ser posible, son unos bombetas! y sólo lo hacen por hacerse notar, y q le esten dando espacio p ser discutido en la asamblea me da rabia! Creo q hay cosas + importantes q decidir si Jesus es o no patrón d Costa Rica (en todos sus territorios)... RIDICULOS!!!!!!! Tenia q ser el mismo bombeta q c trepó a la estatua! Lo màs trsite es uqe lo apoyan varios diputados. Simplmente es una treta para congraciarse con la mayoria de ciudadanos "religiosos" que viven en el pais. Es cierto, cada quien tiene derecho a profesar su religión, aunque aqui empezamos mal cuando la religion católica es la religión oficial del Estado... y por ley.... claro... estoy segura que si se hubiese aprobado a tiempo esta ley, a Josebeth no la hubieran encontrado muerta.... ¿Penas màs fuertes? Nah.... el mejor post q hya leido en un blog. Lo q uno se pierde por lo leer Al Dia. lo peor es que uno se rie en lugar de llorar... hacia donde vamos? y hasta donde llegaremos!!! "Superman, señor de Costa Rica" Asi los ladrones, por miedo a una golpiza por parte del hombre de acero, lo pensaran 2 veces antes de robar. No sabía que se trataba de 26 diputados... En fin, ojalá que impere un poco de sentido común. El proyecto parece como un pretexto para aplazar decisiones de mucha más importancia. Me parece demasiada la falta de seriedad. Estaba leyendo que algunos diputadines están tristes porque como que se está traspapelando el mentado proyecto. Parece que inteligentemente, los otros 31 señ[email protected] han reclamado acerca de la "exclusividad" y "poder" que tendría Jesús, incluyendo ahi las jugadas que la Iglesia Católica haría en nombre de la Ley. Yo que iba a nominar a Shiva para próximo candidato. :( Mucho hablan los que poco saben. Empezando porque existe el nefasto articulo 75 que proclama oficial al catolicismo en CR (sabran los perinclitos padres de la patria que la iglesia catolica declara a Jesucristo como rey de reyes de demas titulos nobles) y por lo tanto, creo que si lo supieran, considerarian innecesario ese proyecto de ley, claro esta, si estan a favor del articulo 75 estos diputados . En cambio, cualquiera de estos que este en contra de ambos (el articulo y el proyecto de ley) considerara al primero como un triste recuerdo de epocas peores (cuando la iglesia influia realmente en la vida del pais) y al segundo como un intento de proclamar algo ya aceptado por el estado, asi como de una declaratoria de competencia entre el catolicismo y el protestantismo, y claro, un disparate legal En mi opiniòn es un triste intento por desviar la atenciòn de proyectos que si pueden repercutir en la vida nacional.

Lafarge aportó más de 29,5 millones a la economía comarcal - Levante-EMV Lafarge aportó más de 29,5 millones a la economía comarcal El consumo de combustibles alternativos ahorró la emisión de 24.300 toneladas de Co2 Acceso a la planta de Lafarge en Sagunt. | DANIEL TORTAJADA La planta de LafargeHolcim en Sagunt inyectó 29,5 millones de euros a la economía del Camp de Morvedre durante el pasado año. Esa es una de las principales conclusiones del balance anual de la cementera, que incluye en este cálculo la contratación de servicios, los convenios, los proyectos sociales, los impuestos y los salarios de sus 150 trabajadores, entre otros. Otro punto destacado desde la empresa es que se convirtió en la primera del sector del cemento en España en obtener el doble sello Calculo y Reduzco, que otorga la Oficina Española de Cambio Climático (OECC) del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico. Este reconocimiento premia el compromiso de auditar su huella de carbono y minimizarla, «un hito al que contribuye la fábrica de Sagunto gracias a su modelo industrial basado en la innovación y la sostenibilidad, con el que afronta el reto de la descarbonización». En este ámbito, la planta consumió unas 39.300 toneladas de combustibles alternativos, entre ellos biomasa, evitando así la emisión a la atmósfera de más de 24.300 toneladas de CO2 fósil, el equivalente al consumo eléctrico de cerca de 20.000 hogares al año, y alcanzó una tasa de sustitución térmica del 43 %, siguiendo en la línea de los porcentajes de otros países europeos. José Luis Coleto, director de la fábrica, señala que «2020 fue un año atípico en el que surgieron muchos retos y dificultades como consecuencia de la covid-19. A pesar de ello y gracias al gran equipo humano de la planta, conseguimos alcanzar hitos como la elevada tasa de sustitución térmica, que va en línea con la hoja de ruta de la compañía en materia de descarbonización. En este sentido, nuestro objetivo de cara a los próximos años es mejorar y adaptar los procesos industriales para la reducción de las emisiones de CO2 y el desarrollo de productos con baja huella de carbono». Estos y otros hitos han sido presentados esta mañana durante la celebración del Comité Local de Información y Sostenibilidad. Un foro anual con representantes de diferentes entidades ciudadanas, sociales y políticas de la localidad, con el fin de establecer un diálogo directo y analizar la evolución de la planta. En esta edición, en formato online, han participado diversos representantes de asociaciones vecinales, políticos y colectivos sociales de Sagunt, el Camp de Morvedre y la provincia de València. Durante el pasado año, la fábrica se implicó en diversas acciones solidarias, como las dirigidas al Centro Solidario de Alimentos. En colaboración con los trabajadores, en mayo se donaron 7.600 kilos de comida, a los que se sumaron otros 1.500 kilos en el mes de diciembre. Además, los trabajadores aportaron alimentos de pr

Obispo de Sardes, +180 Fiesta: 1 de abril Etim: Melitón, griego: "Dulce como la miel" Alabanza de Cristo Obispo de Sardes (Lidia), en Asia Menor (Turquía). Considerado uno de los padres apologistas. Según Tertuliano, fue un profeta muy estimado por los fieles. Estableció el primer canon cristiano del Antiguo Testamento siguiendo el canon aceptado en ese tiempo por los judíos: contiene solo los libros protocanónicos y el Libro de Ester. Presentó paralelos elaborados entre el Antiguo Testamento y el Nuevo Testamento. Posiblemente Melitón creía en el reino milenario de Cristo en la Tierra. En una carta de Polícrates de Éfeso al Papa Víctor cerca del año 194, mencionada por Eusebio de Cesaria (H. E. 5.24) dice que "Melitón el eunuco" fue enterrado en Sardis. Del santo obispo de Sardes solo se conocían breves citas de sus escritos, que estaba lleno del Espíritu Santo y que era célibe. Pero en el año 1940 se descubrieron su Homilía sobre la Pascua y la Apología (c. 170) dirigida al emperador Marco Aurelio, concerniente a la relación entre Iglesia y Estado. Temas principales de sus escritos: cristología y soteriológica; Declara la divinidad y pre-existencia de Cristo como también su encarnación y el carácter sacrificial de su muerte; las consecuencias del pecado y el triunfo de Cristo Resucitado; El carácter de la Iglesia: conjunto de los que viven la vida nueva de Cristo; Las figuras del Antiguo Testamento, especialmente sobre el Cordero. Homilía pascual, 71-73; SC 123, pag. 101 "Herido por el endurecimiento de su corazón." (cf Mc 8,17) El es el cordero sin voz, el cordero degollado, nacido de María, la cordera graciosa. El ha sido sacado del rebaño y llevado a la muerte... Fue asesinado. ¿Dónde? En el corazón de Jerusalén. ¿Por qué? Porque había curado a los cojos, purificado a los leprosos, iluminado a los ciegos y resucitado a los muertos. (Lc 7,22) Por esto ha padecido. En la Ley y en los profetas leemos: "Me devuelven mal por bien. Me acusan cuando busco el bien. Han tramado maquinaciones contra mí: Destruyamos al justo, porque nos resulta odioso." (cf Sal 37,21 y Jr 11,19) ¿Por qué has cometido un crimen que no tiene nombre? Has deshonrado al que te honra, has humillado al que te había exaltado, has renegado del que te había reconocido, has rechazado al que te había llamado, has asesinado al que te había dado la vida... Era necesario que él sufriera, pero no por tu causa. Era necesario que fuera humillado, pero no por ti. Era necesario que fuera juzgado, pero no por ti. Era necesario que fuera crucificado, pero no por ti. ¿No has dirigido esta oración a Dios?: "Maestro, si hace falta que tu Hijo sufra, será por tu voluntad, no por la mía!" (Núms. 65-71: SC 123, 95-101): Muchas predicciones nos dejaron los profetas en torno al misterio de Pascua, que es Cristo; a él la gloria por los siglos de los siglos. El vino desde los cielos a la tierra a causa de los sufrimientos humanos; se revistió de la naturaleza humana en el vientre virginal y apareció como hombre; hizo suyas las pasiones y sufrimientos humanos con su cuerpo, sujeto al dolor, y destruyó las pasiones de la carne, de modo que quien por su espíritu no podía morir acabó con la muerte homicida. Se vio arrastrado como un cordero y degollado como una oveja, y así nos redimió de idolatrar al mundo, el que en otro tiempo libró a los israelitas de Egipto, y nos salva de la esclavitud diabólica, como en otro tiempo a Israel de la mano del Faraón; y marcó nuestras almas con su propio Espíritu, y los miembros de nuestro cuerpo con su sangre. Éste es el que cubrió a la muerte de confusión y dejó sumido al demonio en el llanto, como Moisés al Faraón. Este es el que derrotó a la iniquidad y a la injusticia, como Moisés castigó a Egipto con la esterilidad. Éste es el que nos sacó de la servidumbre a la libertad, de las tinieblas a la luz, de la muerte a la vida, de las tinieblas al recinto eterno, e hizo de nosotros un sacerdocio nuevo y un pueblo elegido y eterno. Él es la Pascua nuestra salvación. Éste es el que tuvo que sufrir mucho y en muchas ocasiones: el mismo que fue asesinado en Abel y atado de manos en Isaac, el mismo que peregrinó en Jacob y vendido en José, expuesto en Moisés y sacrificado en el madero, perseguido en David y deshonrado en los profetas. Éste es el que se encarnó en la Virgen, fue colgado madero y fue sepultado en tierra, y el que, resucitado de entre los muertos, subió al cielo. Éste es el cordero que enmudecía y que fue inmolado; el mismo que nació de María, la hermosa cordera; el mismo que fue arrebatado del rebaño, empujado a la muerte, inmolado al atardecer y sepultado por la noche; aquel que no fue quebrantado en el leño, ni se descompuso en tierra; el mismo que resucitó de entre los muertos e hizo que el hombre surgiera desde lo más hondo del sepulcro. I La novedad del Verbo hecho hombre. Porque, "como una oveja fue llevado al matadero" (Is 53, 7), Lo que era figura pasó, mas la realidad está presente. resucitó de entre los muertos como Dios, Voy a explicar detalladamente las palabras de la Escritura (cfr. Ex 12, 3-28): cómo Dios ordena a Moisés en Egipto, cuando quiere, de una parte someter al faraón bajo el látigo, y de otra librar a Israel del látigo por la mano de Moisés. En efecto, dice: «He aquí que tomarás un cordero sin defecto y sin tacha y al atardecer lo inmolarás con los hijos de Israel, y a la noche lo comerás con prisa, y no romperéis ninguno de sus huesos. Así—dice—harás: en una sola noche lo comeréis por familias y por tribus, ceñidos vuestros lomos y los cayados en vuestras manos. Porque ésta es la pascua del Señor, memorial eterno para los hijos de Israel. Habiendo tomado la sangre de la oveja, untad las puertas exteriores de vuestras casas colocando sobre los montantes de la entrada la señal de la sangre para la intimidación del ángel. Porque he aquí que Yo heriré a Egipto y en una sola noche será privado de hijos, desde el ganado hasta el hombre». Entonces Moisés, habiendo degollado la oveja y ha

Este criterio se estableció debido a la necesidad de lograr un criterio que no tuviese las mismas dificultades que tiene la noción de culpa que reinaba anteriormente en el campo de la responsabilidad civil.

El sitio de mi recreo: junio 2016 Publicado por Juan en 22:19:00 El país que nunca encontrarás en un Atlas Publicado por Juan en 23:40:00 Hace tres años redescubrí los comics. Un buen amigo me puso sobre la pista de los fabulosos nuevos mundos de creación que la novela gráfica contemporánea está explorando y, como soy compulsivo, en cuanto comencé a nadar en ese mar terminé sumergido hasta el fondo. Ahora una cuidada colección de tebeos franceses, anglosajones, españoles o incluso indios y coreanos, ocupa cuatro baldas de mi librería. La selección incluye casi todos los clásicos del canon (Watchmen, Mouse, El Inkal, Persepolis…), las joyas del underground gringo (Burns, Clowes, los Hernández…), el cómic-reportaje actual (Sacco, Delisle, Davodeau…), lo mejor de las aventuras seriadas francófonas (Cosey, Bilal, Marini), las autobiografías intimistas que tanto se prodigan hoy en el mundo de la historieta (David B, Truong, Gallardo, Thompson) y hasta los metacómics y otras experimentaciones de autores como McClaud, McGuire o Sousanis. Manga, en cambio, he leído poco. Conozco Japón y me fascina su cultura, pero un prurito de prejuicio y pánico a transformarme definitivamente en un friki me mantienen distante del mundo del noveno arte nipón. Pero como me las quiero dar de marisabidillo comiquero, no he tenido más remedio que incursionar un poco en el subgénero. Eso sí, lo he hecho con cuidado, tímidamente, y sólo dispuesto a catar obras consagradas. Aquí dejo pues tres recomendaciones de obras clásicas del manga, atípicas las tres. Tebeos, sí, pero de una densidad creativa apabullante. Pies Descalzos, de Keui Nakazawa, viene a ser al manga lo que Mouse es al tebeo occidental: Como la obra de Spiegelman, narra en viñetas una tragedia histórica de dimensiones apocalípticas. Pies Descalzos nos cuenta, en primera persona, la detonación nuclear de Hiroshima y la vida de los supervivientes en los días subsiguientes a la debacle. Nakazawa, que vivió de niño en carne propia todo lo que describe, nos regala un relato sin muchos epítetos ni exageraciones (en todo caso, es difícil exagerar un horror mayor que el que realmente sucedió). Todo está contado con imágenes infantiloides y una narrativa sencilla que provocan un aterrador efecto de contraste entre la inocencia infantil y el horror sin límites. Es, simplemente, un libro imprescindible, cuya lectura debería ser obligatoria en todas las escuelas del mundo, si es que de verdad estamos interesados en crear sociedades pacíficas. Es imposible no oponerse a las armas nucleares después de haber leído Pies Descalzos. Uno nunca vuelve a ver el tema con los mismos ojos. Es un cómic que transforma algo dentro de ti. Pesadillas, de Katsuhiro Otomo, es una obra muy diferente. Para empezar, se trata de pura y dura ficción, o, para ser más específicos, de una novela negra. Ambientada en una arquitectura de geometrías claustrofóbicas, este manga, maravillosamente ilustrado, combina el hiperrealismo descriptivo del Japón urbano contemporáneo con un guion fantasioso e inquietante propio, efectivamente, de la más junguiana de las pesadillas simbólicas. El hombre que camina es el contrapeso perfecto a la anterior. Su autor, Jiro Tanigchi, logra reducir el cómic a un sencillo (y a la vez profundísimo), ejercicio zen: Un tipo camina por un barrio periférico en Japón, en la frontera entre la ciudad y el campo. En cada paseo afronta historias nimias, tales como encuentros con perros y gatos, observaciones del cielo nocturno, baños furtivos en una piscina pública al caer la tarde… intrahistorias cuya profundidad radica, precisamente, en su liviandad. El gran secreto escondido en Un Hombre que camina se llama observación, ese arte complejísimo que los cómics nos enseñan a cultivar. Cada cual de estas novelas gráficas arroja luz sobre un aspecto especifico de ese mirar al mundo tan único del Ja

Y la periodista ha querido compartir la imagen con su programa. Tras unos meses separados por el confinamiento, el torero habría hecho las maletas para trasladarse a Mójacar para reencontrarse con su amiga. En la imagen, podemos ver a Enrique Ponce, con gafas de sol oscuras, y a Ana Soria muy sonrientes, mientras disfrutan de una agradable tarde en una terraza de la ciudad Almeriense. Se trata de Ana Soria una joven de 21 años y estudiante de Derecho. El torero y su amiga "lleva un año y medio de relación" y su relación está tan consolidada que, incluso, Enrique Ponce y Ana Soria habrían hablado de boda, ta

Nuestra vista capta todo lo que está a su alcance (como el sensor de una cámara de fotos) pero es el cerebro quien interpreta lo que vemos, aquello en lo que no reparamos es como si no lo hubiésemos visto (y no podemos rebobinar y volver a vivir lo experimentado), es pues muy importante educar la capacidad de observación (y de retención de imágenes); de lo que nuestro cerebro no es consciente de nada sirve que lo estemos viendo, no lo almacenamos en nuestra memoria ni a corto ni a largo plazo.

Bundesliga: El Dortmund sigue goleando – El Rincón del Fútbol Bundesliga: El Dortmund sigue goleando En su visita a Wolsfburgo, el conjunto Borusser volvió a montar un show de goles y apabulló 5-1 al local. Aubameyang, por duplicado, Guerreiro, Dembelé y Piszczek rubricaron la goleada de un Dortmund que marcó 17 goles en sus últimos tres partidos por todas las competiciones. Esta cuarta jornada de la Bundesliga disputada entresemana empezaba con cuatro encuentros, pero el que resaltaba entre todos ellos era este choque entre un Wolsfburgo, que tenía la intención de hacerse fuerte de local para llevarse una victoria que lo acercara a los líderes Bayern Múnich y Hertha Berlín, y un Borussia Dortmund que tampoco quería perderle pisada a los que encabezan la tabla. El conjunto visitante arrancó totalmente enchufado y se puso rápidamente en ventaja. Marc Bartra, que luego debió salir lesionado, encontró con una pelota profunda fantástica a Raphaël Guerreiro, quien batió al arquero Koen Casteels por el primer palo con ayuda de un desvío en el defensor. Wolfsburgo intentó reaccionar y casi lo empata, pero apareció el arquero Roman Bürki, de gran tarde, para interponerse. Sobre los quince, otro ataque letal de los de Tuchel iba a poner las cosas 2-0. Después de un lateral, Guerreiro asistió con un taco a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, que eludió con categoría a Philipp Wollscheid, ingresó al área y definió contra el segundo palo abriendo el pie. El capitán Marcel Schmelzer tuvo el 3-0, pero esta vez Casteels se lo negó. A partir de ahí el equipo local creció en el juego, comenzó a inquietar al fondo visitante e hizo lucir a Bürki en dos oportunidades. En primera instancia, el suizo le tapó un remate a quemarropa a Mario Gómez y luego despejó de gran forma un tiro libre de su compatriota Ricardo Rodríguez. Para la segunda mitad, el elenco de Dieter Hecking salió decidido a acortar la desventaja y el Dortmund iba a sufrir varios embates. En primer lugar, Bürki se disfrazó de héroe e impidió el descuento a Julian Draxler y a Mario Gómez dentro de la misma jugada de una manera heroica. Sin embargo, el Wolfsburgo descontaría en la acción posterior un tanto del ingresado Daniel Didavi, anticipando un centro desde la derecha. El arquero suizo debió lucirse también para evitar el empate de los Lobos al tapar un remate lejano de Paul Seguin. Pero el Dortmund está afilado a la hora de concretar en el arco rival, y ni bien pudo, encontró en una transición rápida el tercer gol que le sacudió la incertidumbre al encuentro. Guerreiro encontró al espacio a Gonzalo Castro, quien corrió hasta el área y asistió gentilmente a Ousmane Dembelé que con el arco a su merced puso un 3-1 que iba a quebrar el encuentro. Cuatro minutos después, el central Sokratis Papastathopoulos habilitó de gran forma a Castro para que el alemán le entregara su doblete y el cuarto gol del equipo a Aubameyang. Dembelé tuvo en otra contra el quinto, pero éste no llegaría hasta los veintiocho del complemento cuando Lukasz Piszczek conectara de cabeza un córner. Los dirigidos por Tuchel no tuvieron una gota de piedad y acribillaron a goles a un Wolfsburgo que pasó de estar cerca de igualarlo a encontrarse 1-5. Es la tercera victoria en cua

Menús de Cow CRM - Recoletos Pontevedra Inicio Menús de Cow CRM Menús de Cow CRM Cow CRM es la herramienta ideal para que pymes, microempresas y autónomos desarrollen la gestión comercial valiéndose del CRM más adecuado del mercado para ese perfil de empresas, con prestaciones propias de las grandes empresas y a un precio totalmente low cost. Para que se pueda tener una idea completa de lo que aporta, se muestra a continuación el contenido de los menús de los que está dotado Cow CRM y un pequeño resumen de cada uno de ellos. El siguiente es el menú que utiliza Cow CRM para gestionar las peticiones a través del flujo de trabajo: Todas las empresas anotan de una u otra forma las visitas comerciales, reportan información de lo que acontece en ellas, pasan pedidos o cursan emails. Generalmente suelen realizarse de forma individualizada, sin compartir con el resto de la empresa y utilizando herramientas desconectadas, como Excel. Otros procesos como llamadas telefónicas o simples tareas requieren, en la mayoría de los casos, bastante imaginación y herramientas que van desde el uso de papelitos tipo post-it, a innumerables correos electrónicos con instrucciones y reportes de información que no permite hacer un seguimiento sencillo. La información está, por supuesto, pero ¿dónde está y cómo está organizada? El tiempo de recopilación y búsqueda de toda esa información ya compensa la utilización de una herramienta como Cow CRM. El siguiente es el menú que utiliza Cow CRM para gestionar las cuentas y contactos: El cliente, el centro de la gestión de la empresa, alrededor del cual todo gira. Y a los clientes los hemos denominado Cuentas. El concepto de cuenta es un concepto más amplio que el concepto de cliente ya que entendemos por cuenta a cualquier persona física o jurídica que interactúa con nuestra empresa. Cuentas son Clientes, por supuesto, pero también proveedores, prospectos, suministradores o trabajadores. Además, a cada cuenta podemos asociarle infinitos contactos. Y toda la información la tenemos a golpe de click en la 'Ficha de cuenta'. La ficha dispone de un menú mediante el cual se puede acceder a información específica, clasificada y ordenada sobre aspectos de la cuenta: Contactos, Procesos, Peticiones… El siguiente es el menú que utiliza Cow CRM para llevar a cabo la gestión documental: Si pudiera reducir todo el papeleo de la empresa a lo estrictamente necesario Toda la documentación a un clic de distancia. Con los documentos guardados en la base de datos, podemos reducir el papeleo en la empresa a aquellos documentos que precisen una firma. Todos los usuarios, según los niveles de seguridad que se le asignen a los documentos, tendrán acceso a ellos desde cualquier lugar. Control de lectura, verificación de documentos, acceso inmediato a mis documentos y muchas opciones más… Productos, tarifas y ventas El siguiente es el menú que utiliza Cow CRM para llevar a cabo la gestión de productos, tarifas y ventas: El cliente es muy importante, pero… Los productos con Cow CRM se gestionan de una forma sencilla y amigable. El producto también se encuentra en el centro de nuestra gestión. Como las cuentas, toda la información la encontraremos en su ficha.

Una VPN no solo enmascara su ubicación, sino que también encripta la conexión y hace que sea casi imposible para los forasteros rastrear lo que está navegando. Además, dependiendo de dónde se encuentre el servidor VPN, puede acceder fácilmente a sitios web con restricciones geográficas. Hay varios servicios de VPN, tanto gratuitos como de pago. Sin embargo, el único problema al que siempre me enfrento cuando utilizo estos servicios VPN de terceros es que son bastante lentos. Por ejemplo, tengo una conexión decente de 30 Mbps en mi casa. Pero, cuando me conecto a un servicio de VPN de terceros, la velocidad de conexión se reduce a entre 1 y 5 Mbps. Una de las razones de esto es que los servicios VPN almacenan a tantas personas como sea posible en un solo servidor y todos esos usuarios deben compartir el ancho de banda disponible. Además, cuando utiliza un servicio VPN de terceros, no tiene control sobre cómo utilizan los datos que recopilan sobre usted. Para hacer frente a todo esto, puede cómo configurar su propio servidor VPN en el poder y conectarse a él. Tenga en cuenta que crear su propio servidor VPN no es gratis. Como mínimo, debe pagar $ 5 por mes por servidor, lo que le brinda 1 TB de ancho de banda mensual. Ahora, quiero que la creación de VPN sea lo más simple posible para que incluso un usuario principiante que nunca haya creado o tratado con la nube pueda sentirse cómodo. Por esa razón, estoy usando Vultr. Esto se debe a que Vultr ofrece una imagen OpenVPN preconfigurada que facilita la creación de su propio servicio VPN. Siga los pasos a continuación tal como están y debería tener su propio servidor VPN en minutos. Leer: Explicación del protocolo VPN – PPTP vs L2TP vs SSTP vs IKEYv2 vs OpenVPN Página de administración de OpenVPN Palabras de cierre: Sconfigura tu propio servidor VPN Primero, regístrese para obtener una cuenta Vultr. Después de eso, vaya a la pantalla principal y seleccione las opciones de «Servidor» en el panel izquierdo. A continuación, haga clic en el icono «+» que aparece en la esquina superior derecha. Serás llevado a la pantalla de configuración del servidor. Primero, seleccione el país en el que desea que esté ubicado su servidor. En mi caso, como quiero que mi VPN tenga una dirección IP de Estados Unidos, estoy seleccionando la ubicación de Nueva York. Vultr tiene una imagen predefinida para crear su propio servidor VPN. Lo que simplemente significa que no tiene que pasar por todo el esfuerzo de configurar manualmente el servidor, instalar todo el software relacionado con VPN y configurarlo. Entonces, vaya a la pestaña «Aplicaciones» y seleccione la opción «OpenVPN». El siguiente paso es seleccionar el tamaño del servidor. Dado que el servidor de $ 5 ofrece 1TB de ancho de banda, es suficiente para la mayoría. Entonces, seleccione el servidor de $ 5. Si desea más ancho de banda, también puede seleccionar otros tamaños. Puede dejar todas las demás configuraciones como están. En la parte inferior de la página, puede nombrar su servidor. Asígnele el nombre que desee y haga clic en el botón «Implementar ahora». La configuración del servidor puede llevar unos minutos. Dado que seleccionamos una imagen OpenVPN preconfigurada, el servidor se configura automáticamente en segundo plano. Una vez que el servidor esté instalado y configurado correctamente, verá «En ejecución» en la sección «Estado». Dado que el servidor está preconfigurado para usar OpenVPN, se crea un nombre de usuario y una contraseña de administrador de VPN para usted. Haga clic en el nombre del servidor y encontrará la dirección IP de inicio de sesión, el nombre de usuario y la contraseña del panel de administración de OpenVPN justo debajo de los detalles del servidor. El mismo nombre de usuario y contraseña se envían a su dirección de correo electrónico. Nota: Tenga en cuenta que el nombre de usuario y la contraseña de OpenVPN son diferentes del nombre de usuario y la contraseña del servidor real. Copie la dirección IP del servidor, péguela en la barra de direcciones y presione el botón Enter. Su navegador puede advertir que el certificado SSL no es válido. Esto es perfectamente normal. Haga clic en el enlace «Avanzado». Ahora verá la pantalla de inicio de sesión de administrador de OpenVPN. Copie el nombre de usuario y la contraseña de la página de detalles del servidor Vultr, péguelos, seleccione «Iniciar sesión» en el menú desplegable y haga clic en el botón «Ir». Hasta ahora, solo ha creado un servidor VPN. Debe conectarse a ese servidor para crear una conexión VPN. Para facilitar las cosas. OpenVPN le ofrece un instalador simple para Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android e iOS. Este instalador le permite conectarse a su servidor VPN con un solo clic desde el sistema de su elección. Simplemente haga clic en el enlace y se descargará el instalador. En mi caso, estoy descargando el instalador de Windows. Después de descargar el software, instálelo como cualquier otro software de Windows. Una vez instalado, verá que OpenVPN se agrega a la barra de tareas de Windows. Haga clic con el botón derecho en el icono de OpenVPN, expanda el menú de la dirección IP de su servidor y haga clic en el botón «Conectar». Se le pedirá que ingrese el nombre de usuario y la contraseña de OpenVPN. Escriba esos detalles y haga clic en el botón «Conectar». Dado que es la primera vez que se conecta al servidor VPN y tiene un certificado SSL personalizado, verá una ventana de advertencia. Seleccione la casilla de verificación «No volver a preguntar» y haga clic en el botón «Sí». Eso es. El software se conectará a su servidor y establecerá la conexión VPN. Si lo desea, puede buscar «cuál es mi dirección IP» en Google y mostrará la dirección IP de su servidor en lugar de su dirección IP real. Cuando desee desconectarse del servidor VPN, haga clic con el botón derecho en el icono de OpenVPN en la barra de tareas y seleccione la opción «Desconectar». Ahora, si lo desea, puede ver cuántos usuarios están conectados a su servidor VPN. Para hacerlo, inicie sesión en su servidor VPN desde el navegador web y haga clic en el botón «Admin». En la página de administración, vaya a la página «Usuarios actuales» y verá todos los usuarios / sistemas conectados. Esta página también proporciona la dirección IP real de los sistemas conectados y cuántos datos se utilizan. Cuando sea necesario, también puede crear varios usuarios a través de la página de administración de OpenVPN. Para crear usuarios, simplemente vaya a la página «Permisos de usuario» en la sección «Administración de usuarios». En el panel derecho, escriba el nombre de usuario en el campo en blanco y presione el botón Guardar configuración. Si desea otorgar derechos de administrador a ese usu

El portavoz del Gobierno catalán cree que no hay «marcha atrás» y que la consulta se debe hacer cuanto antes | Teinteresa El portavoz del Gobierno catalán cree que no hay «marcha atrás» y que la consulta se debe hacer cuanto antes El portavoz del Gobierno catalán, Francesc Homs, asegura que no hay «marcha atrás» hacia el Estado propio y que la consulta de autodeterminación se debe celebrar cuanto antes mejor, aunque no ha querido establecer un plazo. En declaraciones a Rac1 recogidas por Europa Press, ha afirmado que el Estado propio es la prioridad y que la »hoja de ruta» debe pasar por hacer una consulta con garantías, que haya una mayoría social muy amplia a favor del Estado propio y que exista el compromiso inequívoco de estar «sí o sí» dentro de Europa. «Somos contribuidores netos en la Unión Europea; es impensable que se nos eche –ha dicho el portavoz del Govern–. Si seguimos la »hoja de ruta», Cataluña tendrá itinerario dentro de Europa». Homs ha subrayado la importancia de las elecciones del 25 de noviembre y ha afirmado que, en caso de que no hubiese una mayoría de diputados nacionalistas, sería «automático» que no habría un reconocimiento internacional, resaltando la importancia del valor democrático en este contexto. El portavoz del Govern ha afirmado que la petición de un Estado propio no es una «operación táctica» y ha afirmado que Cataluña está segura de sí misma y quiere emprender su camino. Homs ha considerado que una pregunta en la consulta sobre si estaría de acuerdo con que Cataluña fuera un Estado propio dentro de España, ha sostenido que sería «dar una vuelta muy larga para llegar al mismo sitio». Ha sostenido que no hay marcha atrás hacia el Estado propio porque durante los últimos 30 años Cataluña lo ha intentado «todo» y la respuesta siempre ha sido »no», y lo que pasa ahora es que Cataluña tiene un proyecto sobre dónde quiere ir que pasa por internacionalizar la economía y vertebrar el Estado del Bienestar más eficientemente, entre otros aspectos. En cuanto a las declaraciones del expresidente del Gobierno José María Aznar, sobre que antes se romperá la cohesión de la sociedad catalana que el Estado español, cree que demuestra que «no conoce Cataluña», qu

you can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that weve all learned in school id like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope if i spin this can we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin and has a spin axis in this direction if we give it a particular torque and ill do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once its spinning by the equations we can predict that s i put this torque on it it will in fact rotate this direction l

Las dos caras Chilenas | Pobreza en Chile; Problema de todos Pobreza en Chile; Problema de todos Pobreza, concepto Posted in Uncategorized on 26 octubre, 2008 by ceja08 En este mapa podemos observar un pequeño acercamiento al concepto de pobreza, que nos servirá para comprender nuestro blog. Parodia Pobreza, 'Chile Desigual'. Posted in Uncategorized on 25 octubre, 2008 by ceja08 Parodia realizada, a manera de identificar, de esta forma las diferencias entre estas dos clases sociales. Ensayo: "Chile Desigual" Siempre nos ha llamado la atención la desigualdad en Chile. ¿Sabemos todos que nuestra distribución es escandalósamente escandalosa (valga la rebundancia)? ¿Estamos conscientes de los reales niveles de desigualdad que posee nuestro querido país? Revisemos algunos pequeños datos. El índice más aceptado a nivel mundial para medir dicho problema, es el coeficiente de Gini. Este es un factor que se sitúa entre el 0 y el 1, siendo 1 un país la distribución concentrada en un sólo individuo, y 0, un país con distribucion perfectamente homogénea. Chile posee un Gini de 0.5649, solo comparable con algunas tristes realidades como Nigeria y Bangladesh. Para contextualizar un poco, África al sur del Sahara tiene Gini 0.4695, América Latina y Caribe 0.4931, Asia Oriental y el Pacífico 0.3809, Asia del Sur 0.3188, Europa del Este 0.2894, Medio Oriente y África del Norte 0.3803, los países industrializados o en vías de desarrollo con altos ingresos 0.3375 . Vale decir, una de las peores distribuciones del mundo. Las causas de la desigualdad en Chile han sido estudiadas extensamente por distintos individuos. En el CEP (Centro de Estudios Públicos), se han realizado incontables estudios al respecto, atribuyendo la desigualdad de nuestro país a la falta de acumulación de capital humano y físico, la mala distribución inicial de las riquezas, los retornos de la educación, la sobre dependencia a los recursos naturales, etc. Sin embargo, llama mucho la atención que si sacamos del análisis al decil de mayor ingreso, vale decir, al 10% mas rico de nuestro país, la desigualdad en Chile prácticamente desaparece, tal como podemos observar en el siguiente gráfico. La barra oscura muestra el Gini total de los países, en cambio la barra clara muestra el Gini con la exclusión del 10% más rico. En resumidas cuentas, las causas de la desigualdad son múltiples, pero esta se explica en el caso chileno, por una concentración de riquezas del decil de mejor ingreso. Pero no deja de ser llamativo, que pese a esto, la elite chilena exhiba portentósamente sus riquezas, evidenciando sus bienes y su carencia de moral. Lo que no sabe este 10%, es que sus riquezas son producto no de sus esfuerzos sino que simplemente del azar. Si bien, hay individuos que meritoriame

Canuto IV; Bto. Marcelo Spínola II del T.O. 2ª del salterio 1Sam 16,1-13 / Sal 88 / Mc 2,23-28 Primera Lectura: 1Samuel 16,1-13 En aquellos días, el Señor dijo a Samuel: «¿Hasta cuándo vas a estar lamentándote por Saúl, si yo lo he rechazado como rey de Israel? Llena la cuerna de aceite y vete, por encargo mío, a Jesé, el de Belén, porque entre sus hijos me he elegido un rey». Samuel contestó: «¿Cómo voy a ir? Si se entera Saúl, me mata». El Señor le dijo: «Llevas una novilla y dices que vas a hacer un sacrificio al Señor. Convidas a Jesé al sacrificio, y yo te indicaré lo que tienes que hacer; me ungirás al que yo te diga». Samuel hizo lo que le mandó el Señor. Cuando llegó a Belén, los ancianos del pueblo fueron ansiosos a su encuentro: «¿Vienes en son de paz?». Respondió: «Sí, vengo a hacer un sacrificio al Señor. Purificaos y venid conmigo al sacrificio». Purificó a Jesé y a sus hijos y los convidó al sacrificio. Cuando llegó, vio a Eliab y pensó: «Seguro, el Señor tiene delante a su ungido». Pero el Señor le dijo: «No te fijes en las apariencias ni en su buena estatura. Lo rechazo. Porque Dios no ve como los hombres, que ven la apariencia; el Señor ve el corazón». Jesé llamó a Abinadab y lo hizo pasar ante Samuel; y Samuel le dijo: «Tampoco a este lo ha elegido el Señor». Jesé hizo pasar a Samá; y Samuel le dijo: «Tampoco a este lo ha elegido el Señor». Jesé hizo pasar a siete hijos suyos ante Samuel; y Samuel le dijo: «Tampoco a estos los ha elegido el Señor». Luego preguntó a Jesé: «Se acabaron los muchachos». Jesé respondió: «Queda el pequeño, que precisamente está cuidando las ovejas». Samuel dijo: «Manda por él, que no nos sentaremos a la mesa mientras no llegue». Jesé mandó a por él y lo hizo entrar: era de buen color, de hermosos ojos y buen tipo. Entonces el Señor dijo a Samuel: «Anda, úngelo, porque es este». Samuel tomó la cuerna de aceite y lo ungió en medio de sus hermanos. En aquel momento, invadió a David el espíritu del Señor, y estuvo con él en adelante. Samuel emprendió la vuelta a Ramá. Salmo responsorial: Salmo 88,20.21-22.27-28 Un día hablaste en visión a tus amigos: «He ceñido la corona a un héroe, he levantado a un soldado sobre el pueblo. Él me invocará: "Tú eres mi padre, mi Dios, mi Roca salvadora", y yo lo nombraré mi primogénito, excelso entre los reyes de la tierra». Evangelio: según san Marcos 2,23-28 Un sábado, atravesaba el Señor un sembrado; mientras andaban, los discípulos iban arrancando espigas. Los fariseos le dijeron: «Oye, ¿por qué hacen en sábado lo que no está permitido?». Él les respondió: «¿No habéis leído nunca lo que hizo David, cuando él y sus hombres se vieron faltos y con hambre? Entró en la casa de Dios, en tiempo del sumo sacerdote Abiatar, comió de los panes presentados, que solo pueden comer los sacerdotes, y les dio también a sus compañeros». Y añadió: «

Estas zonas grasas, poco estéticas y a veces dolorosas, no desaparecen ni con ejercicio físico ni con dieta. Con el tiempo, las células jóvenes se ralentizan, igual que la producción de colágeno y elastina, lo que provoca una relajación cutánea.

Hartazgo por trabajos inconclusos en arteria - Novedades de Campeche Inicio Carmen Hartazgo por trabajos inconclusos en arteria Hartazgo por trabajos inconclusos en arteria Los vecinos de la colonia Francisco I. Madero piden que se apliquen sanciones a los responsables Debido a los trabajos inconclusos de pavimentación de concreto hidráulico en la calle 5 de Febrero por Juventino Rosas, un grupo de vecinos de la colonia Francisco I Madero, exigieron a las autoridades municipales reanudar las obras en el sector. Cansados de esta situación recordaron que la rehabilitación de la mencionada arteria estaba a cargo de la constructora Gass Group, misma que se adjudicó un contrato de tres millones 684 mil 324 pesos con 77 centavos. El representante de los colonos, Álvaro Acosta Benítez, detalló que hace cinco meses la citada empresa inició con los trabajos del levantamiento de la carpeta asfáltica, y hasta la fecha no ha regresado para concluir con la pavimentación. Indicó que debido a las malas condiciones de la calle, se han registrado varios accidentes incidentes, además de fallas en los automóviles. Señaló que en varias ocasiones ha acudido a la Dirección de Obras Públicas del Ayuntamiento de Carmen, para exigir el reinicio de los trabajos, sin una respuesta ha

El tema de Género en el Proyecto de la constitución cubana. Valoración del Grupo ECO MUJER DE PINAR DEL RÍO. | EcoMujer e.V. - Frauen und Umwelt Startseite→Español→El tema de Género en el Proyecto de la constitución cubana. Valoración del Grupo ECO MUJER DE PINAR DEL RÍO. ← Soli Cuba e.V. und EcoMujer e.V. im Cafe Eden auf Weltreise nach Kuba Der Genderaspekt im cubanischen Verfassungsentwurf. Auswertung der Gruppe EcoMujer in Pinar del Rio → Autores: Dra.C. Rosa Hernández Acosta | MsC. Silvia Armas Hernández | MsC. Reina María Rodríguez García La característica principal del Modelo Cuba es que constituye a la población como constituyente, esto quiere decir que todo el proceso de aprobación se realiza presentando el Proyecto de Constitución a la consulta popular para su aprobación o no por el pueblo. Desde que comenzó el proceso se realizan las asambleas a nivel de Centros de trabajo, los barrios, los centros de estudio y otras entidades garantizando que todos los ciudadanos cubanos puedan dar sus opiniones, de forma libre y soberana. En relación a los derechos individuales nuestro grupo de ECO-MUJER valora la importancia de que en el proyecto se atiende la equidad de género ya que en el ARTÍCULO 40. Se plantea que todas las personas son iguales ante la ley, están sujetas a iguales deberes, reciben la misma protección y trato de las autoridades y gozan de los mismos derechos, libertades y oportunidades, sin ninguna discriminación por razones de sexo, género, orientación sexual, identidad de género, origen étnico, color de la piel, creencia religiosa, discapacidad, origen nacional o cualquier otra distinción lesiva a la dignidad humana. Resulta interesante el tratamiento que se hace en el proyecto de constitución a los Derechos Individuales, en especial nos referimos a un problema no resuelto de forma total sobre las mujeres y que se incluye en el ARTÍCULO 45. que plantea. La mujer y el hombre gozan de iguales derechos y responsabilidades en lo económico, político, cultural, social y familiar. Resulta interesante reconocer que hemos crecido de forma significativa en el número de mujeres con cargos como dirigentes en las diferentes categorías de dirección con muy buena representación en el Consejo de Estado y de Ministro. 148. El Estado garantiza que se ofrezcan a ambos las mismas oportunidades y posibilidades. 149. El Estado propicia la plena participación de la mujer en el desarrollo del país y la protege ante cualquier tipo de violencia. Muy discutido a nivel de país resultó el CAPÍTULO III del proyecto de constitución sobre derechos Sociales, Económicos y Culturales, cuando se hace el análisis del ARTÍCULO 68. que plantea que: El matrimonio es la unión voluntariamente concertada entre dos personas con aptitud legal para ello, a fin de hacer vida en común. Descansa en la igualdad absoluta de derechos y deberes de los cónyuges, los que están obligados al mantenimiento del hogar y a la formación integral de los hijos mediante el esfuerzo común, de modo que este resulte compatible con el desarrollo de sus actividades sociales. 193. La ley regula la formalización, reconocimiento, disolución del matrimonio y los derechos y obligaciones que de dichos actos se der

Inicio / ¿Qué Es Un ICO? Adquiriendo los recursos de financiación de un proyecto determinado a través del internet con la garantía de revalorización de la inversión inicial de acuerdo a los movimientos de las mismas en el mercado de las criptomonedas. El proyecto en busca de financiación emite cierta cantidad de cripto activos o tokens sobre una plataforma o blockchain existente como bitcoins y lo entrega los inversores a cambio de criptomonedas y en algunos casos dinero fiduciario. Se logra con la automatización a través de internet con contratos inteligentes de acuerdo a los requerimientos del dueño del ICO con altos estándares de seguridad. Características De Un ICO Sus características principales como fuente de financiación de proyectos pueden enumerarse así: Globalización: Por ser transadas a través de internet no existe limitante para que cualquier persona en cualquier lugar del mundo participe, dependiendo de ciertas regiones donde se prohíbe su aplicación. Poca Regulación: Puede ser ambivalente existen en la actualidad muy poca regulación nivel mundial, por lo que el capital de financiación y tenedores de ICOs no cuentan con ningún tipo de protección jurídica. Prohibidos actualmente en china y Sur Corea y regulados en Estados Unidos por la ley de seguros. Inversión Ilimitada: Los inversores en este tipo de financiación pueden realizar las compras sin importar que sean pequeñas o grandes cantidades de tokens ofertados.- Limitado solo por las condiciones que los dueños impongan. Facilidad: Durante la ICO los inversionistas pueden pactar directamente sobre la plataforma o blockchain sin la necesidad de un intermediario, brokers o corredor de bolsa. Diferencia Entre Una IPO Y Un ICO Los IPOs (Initial Public Offering) siglas en inglés u Oferta Pública Inicial es una venta por primera vez de acciones de una empresa al público en el mercado de capitales creando obligaciones en la financiación. Los ICOs (Initial Coin Offering) por su parte colocan un tokens o cripto activo, sin una obligación directa sobre el capital de financiación, representa capital accionario en la empresa o proyecto pero le permite al tenedor interactuar en la plataforma a ser lanzada.

En medio de esta situación, muchos han recordado sus vínculos con el chavismo, que le han traído investigaciones en su contra.

Archive for the 'Infección urinaria' Category Published by Médico Urólogo Rodrigo Leyton Naranjo, en Santiago, Chile on 17 Jun 2015 La INFECCION URINARIA puede presentarse en cualquier momento y les da a hombres y mujeres por igual, aunque puede tener mayor incidencia en aquellas en estado de embarazo. Es recomendable acudir a un urólogo cuando se presentan los síntomas de INFECCION URINARIA. En Santiago de Chile hay un especialista accesible al que puede consultar con la mayor tranquilidad: se trata de Rodrigo Leyton Naranjo médico cirujano especialista en Urología de la Universidad de Santiago, entidad en la que también es profesor. Es miembro y director de la Sociedad Chilena y de la Sociedad Internacional de Urología, tiene amplia experiencia en fertilidad humana, incontinencia urinaria, cáncer testicular, INFECCION URINARIA, entre otras áreas de resorte de esta disciplina como la enuresis, el cáncer de próstata, la disfunción eréctil o impotencia sexual. Lo consigue en su consultorio de la clínica INDISA, en Providencia. En qué consiste la INFECCION URINARIA La INFECCION URINARIA se refiere a la presencia de signos y síntomas clínicos derivados de las vías genitourinarias y microorganismos en la orina. Ésta puede estar localizada en la en la vejiga y es lo que se conoce como cistitis, en el riñón, que es la pielonefritis o en la próstata (prostatitis bacteriana aguda o crónica). La INFECCION URINARIA del tracto urinario se puede tratar con antibióticos aunque existen muchos remedios naturales para combatirla. Algunas veces, la INFECCION URINARIA cede sin medicamentos, cuando no es grave. En todo caso, si ésta se repite con alguna frecuencia, es decir dos o más en seis meses o, se presenta en tres o más episodios en un año (esto sobre todo se da en mujeres jóvenes), es necesario hacer un estudio y un tratamiento más especializados, que los debe hacer un experto como el doctor Leyton. Detalles de la INFECCION URINARIA que es bueno saber En las mujeres es más frecuente contraer una INFECCION URINARIA porque que la uretra es más corta y está más cerca del ano, a diferencia de los hombres. Por esta razón, las probabilidades de que las mujeres contraigan una infección urinaria son más altas, sobre todo después de la actividad sexual o al utilizar diafragma para el control natal. La menopausia también aumenta el riesgo de contraerla.

Virado en sepia: ¿Cómo será la formación y educación necesaria en las próximas décadas? ¿Cómo será la formación y educación necesaria en las próximas décadas? El trabajo que hay que realizar en formación, en educación, adaptada a la realidad del siglo XXI, es brutal y urgente. Sobre todo si le sumamos los caminos perdidos en las últimas dos décadas por errores graves en la calidad formativa. Tan es así que hay una tendencia que va cobrando cuerpo con fuerza que nos dice que deberemos desaprender parte de lo aprendido, para no basarnos tanto en materias memorizadas como en saber emplear la intuición, las decisiones propias según el momento y la ocasión, la iniciativa y el trabajar en equipo. Y saber buscar en cada momento los lugares de los que tenemos que beber y aprender nuevos conocimientos. Saber desde donde hay que leer, ver, tocar, escuchar, observar lo que poco a poco va viniendo como novedades y que casi siempre es lo mismo pero readaptado. Todos estudiamos para ser más eficaces en nuestra vida, para nosotros y para la sociedad. Es decir, para trabajar. El trabajo es el que nos hará felices si tenemos la suerte de poder elegir lo que nos gusta, y además, de proporcionarnos lo necesario para vivir, y servirá para ayudar a la sociedad sobre la que vivimos. Pero ahora ya intuimos posible que no haya trabajo para todos, o el menos no para 40 horas semanales. Y sabemos también que gran parte de lo aprendido ya no sirve, sobre todo si no hemos sido capaces de seguir aprendiendo constantemente. La actualización de contenidos debe ser tenaz a lo largo de nuestra vida real, no solo de nuestra vida laboral. Las nuevas personas laborales con responsabilidad en puestos de calidad me

Todos los componentes ideológicos de las humanidades salen a flote en esta clase de discusiones, y nos ayudan poco a comprender el verdadero meollo de la cuestión[20]. Otros, dichosamente, cumplen a plenitud con el propósito cierto de toda ciencia social y humanística, es decir ayudar a la gente a entender mejor el mundo en el que le ha tocado vivir. En los pequeños países del capitalismo periférico como Costa Rica se nota que algunas cosas están cambiando violentamente, porque casi de la noche a la mañana, quiso saltarhombre Nike Kevin Durant ext "tejida" deportivo de moda casual zapatillas 806393 001, hacia el futuro de progreso y prosperidad prometido por los ideólogos del neoliberalismo, orientando una parte importante de su estructura económica hacia la producción, promoción y expansión del turismo; pero, sin sorpresa, se encuentra hoy con que casi la mitad de sus hoteles, playas y centros de recreación para turistas está vacía. Ese mismo país se vio a sí mismo con el problema entre sus manos de que, habiendo sido tradicionalmente agrario, un grueso importante de sus exportaciones de frutas se ha contraído de manera decisiva. El desempleo lo está afectando, y con ello la criminalidad se apura a superar el ritmo que traía, debido a la desprotección de una legislación obsoleta para atender los nuevos retos que las mafias internacionales le han planteado. Esas son algunas de las consecuencias que la estrecha y paralizante dependencia de la economía norteamericana le ha ocasionado a este pequeño país que se llama Costa Rica. Mas esta serie de problemas económicos, los cuales tienenhombre SZ 14 Nike tren ultrarrápido Flyknit gris / verde zapatos para correr 843694 006, repercusiones sociales, políticas y culturales importantes en nuestra población, tienen un origen muy Caja nueva nike free tren versatilidad TB para hombres zapatos blanco negro talla 12,5 cuero,preciso. Estamos en crisis decimos: no hay créditos porque el dinero es muy caro, o sea, las tasas de interés son muy altas, se ha contraído la construcción de casas, los combustibles suben, la comida cada día es más cara, a los jóvenes se les han reducido las posibilidades de encontrar trabajo, en la profesión que tantos años de estudio les ha tomado, y, finalmente, se corre el riesgo de perder el empleo, que se ha vuelto el bien más preciado que tiene una persona hoy día. Pues bien, toda esta situación, que tanta inseguridad e incertidumbre le producen al costarricense promedio, procede de los Estados Unidos. Y veamos por qué. La economía norteamericana salió excepcionalmente fortalecida de la SegundaDS Nike Air huarache 2018 correr se "cáñamo" Phantom 10,5 retro presto Rift Woven Max, Guerra Mundial (1939-1945). Incluso se dio el lujo de crear instituciones que vigilaríanHombres Puma Future Cat M1 Citi zapatillas, nuevo BLK leather sport zapatos para caminar de 8,5, el comportamiento del capitalismo financiero de ahí en adelante, tales como el Fondo Monetario Internacional y el Banco Mundial, que fueron pensadas, en gran parte, para impedir que Estados Unidos perdiera su hegemonía sobre el sistema económico mundial. Y se dio una época de prosperidad sin precedentes en ese país, entre los años de 1948 y 1966 debida, con mucho, a las fuertes inversiones de recuperación económica que los norteamericanos habían impulsado en Europa y Asia, a través del mal conocido Plan Marshall. No sólo llegó a ser el principal acreedor del planeta, sino que también las mayores reservas de oro del mundo quedaron en sus manos. Contra tanta riqueza, los Estados Unidos empezaron a emitir masas descomunales de dólares, con los cuales prácticamente inundaron el mercado mundial, unahombre adidas Originals i-5923 inki Runner zapatos blanco / negro nuevo, estrategia pensada para compensar los indicios de contracción de su capacidad de pago en oro, debida a las demandas procedentes de las economías europeas y asiáticas que buscaban reactivar y fortalecer sus actividades bancarias y financieras. De esta forma, en la década siguiente, los años setenta, el dólar entró en crisis, y aceleró una revisión del sistema monetario y del sistema internacional de pagos. Con la guerra de Viet-Nam (1969-1975), Estados Unidos intentó contra pesar el impacto que la situación estaba generando en su capacidad de acumulación y en el proceso de reproducción capitalista, puesto que la crisis del dólar (1974-1977) era simplemente el síntoma de un mal mayor: la acerada tendencia que tiene la economía norteamericana al sobre endeudamiento y al sobre consumo, a través de los cuales se crea a sí misma cuellos de botella que son, finalmente, desbloqueados por la economía internacional. Es decir, Estados Unidos desvaloriza el dólar y dehombre nike air max invigor Negro Talla 9 buen estado,esta manera les pasa la factura a las economías emergentes y dependientesAdidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 mantequilla comodo, o semi coloniales[21]. La crisis de la deuda en América Latina (1980-1982) formó parte de este proceso, con el cual la economía norteamericana buscó remontar sus propios problemas financieros internos. Cuando, durante estos años, los países latinoamericanos se declararon insolventes, fue porque las corporaciones bancarias internacionales, con residencia en Estados Unidos, habían acelerado el proceso de endeudamiento de estos países para financiar su propio patrón de crecimiento. Esto no ha cambiado hasta el presente. De acuerdo con los neoliberales dicha estrategia financiera era perfectamente normal, puesto que, desde finales de los años setenta, venían sosteniendo que hombre Nike Max Uptempo' 95 en QS 922932-400 comodo,la menor ingerencia del Estado en los negocios, era la actitud más saludable para que deudores y acreedores saldaran sus desacuerdos sin traumas ni conflictos escandalosos. Resulta, sin embargo, que el endeudamiento externo hizo colapsar a la economía latinoamericana, provocando un retroceso descomunal en áreas tan decisivas, socialmente hablando, como vivienda, acueductos, educación y salud. El desplome de economías, otrora tan progresistas como la argentina, la mexicana y la brasileña, fue un espectáculo que dejó lecciones todavía insalvables, y que explican mayormente, el auge de la economía social que se está operando en América Latina hoy. Los años ochenta, por su lado, la década perdida en América Latina, son también, al mismo tiempo, aquellos durante los cuales cristalizó una readecuación importante Adidas zx Flux negro / Power Morado mujer Talla 8 Athletic zapatos,de las economías hegemónicas a escala internacional. Con su fracaso en la guerra de Viet-Nam, los Estados Unidos tendrían que negociar con la vieja Unión Soviética y con China la distribución geoestratégica que le esperaría al mundo del siglo XXI, donde una Alemania y un Japón con nuevos bríos emergerían para participar, como en el pasado, en el reparto del botín. Igualmente en la URSS, con la Perestroika de 1984, tendría lugar un ajuste de Hombres Adidas EQT de Apoyo de mediados de ADV PK cq2999 primeknit negro / amarillo - reducción de precios,cuentas sin precedentes en la historia universal de los imperios, puesAuthentic nike air jordan 1 Mid 811124-035 Air Jordan 1 retro de mediados de alta baja, se trataba del primero que cometía suicidio y repartía los pedazos al mejor postor. En 1989, China también experimentaba la primera gran sacudida de un modelo de desarrollo económico-social y político que empezaba a operar en dos vertientes, no siempre armónicas, la economía y la institucionalidad política, como se verá después, durante los años noventa, cuando la restauración capitalista despegaba con consecuencias sociales todavía por verse. En la década siguiente, en los Estados Unidos, Gran Bretaña, Japón y otrasCg2976 adidas mujer ultraboost OLIVA OLIVA x noche trazas carga Tech Rust, potencias industriales, así como en China, el nuevo "taller del mundo", se desataba un auge espectacular de la construcción, que solo hacía más notoria una de las contradicciones históricas del sistema capitalista: el problema de la sobre producción y el sub consumo. El sobre endeudamiento y el sobre consumo, por su parte, como corolarios de aquella contradicción básica, evidenciaban, que la llamada "burbuja financiera", el capital ficticio, que no siempre tiene relación directa con la economía real, era una nueva forma de expresarse la sincronía alcanzada, a través de la globalización financiera, de las economías centrales a escala mundial. La crisis asiática de 1997 y el "efecto tequila", procedenteEfimera Racer Azul / blanco Hombres Nike talla US 5 nuevos 100% autentico, de México en 1995, así lo hacían notar. En pocas palabras, lo que queremos decir Hyperdunk 2018 Nike baloncesto Carolina Tarheel Azul / blanco talla 8,5,es que hoy, más que nunca antes, una crisis en el centro capitalista, tiene efectos directos en las otras economías ancilares y periféricas del sistema. Y para continuar hablando de burbujas, la "burbuja inmobiliaria" será también uno de los detonantes de la crisis en Japón y México. Hubo momentos en que en el centro de Tokyo un metro cuadrado de construcción costaba US$300,000. Para construir, sin embargo, se requerían grandes masas de crédito, y para que éste estuviera disponible se necesitaban ciertos patrones de consumo y rentabilidad y ésta, a su vez, estaba en relación directa, supuestamente, con la capacidad productiva de la economía que la hacía posible. Pero, si el grueso del dinero en los bancos y financieras norteamericanos es capital-dinero procedente de inversionistas asiáticos hombre Adidas ultra Boost St hombres corredores / zapatillas de deporte / fitness / zapatillas de entrenamiento,y europeos, o de corporaciones multinacionales con sede en los Estados Unidos, para hacerlo circular hay que pagarle elevadas tasas de interés al verdadero propietario de tales capitales, con lo cual el sistema bancario norteamericano se torna en uno de los más endeudados del planeta y su población asume igual condición de endeudamiento. En algún punto de la cadena crediticia, esta situación hará crisis puesto que la capacidad productiva Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 v2semi frozenAmarillo reducción de precio,de la sociedad, sus patrones de acumulación, quedarán por debajo dehombre Nike Air Zoom Baseball / softball de metal nuevo comodo, las demandas y expectativas del capital financiero, de tal forma que la brecha se superará de forma ficticia acudiendo al sobre consumo y estrangulando a la gente con préstamos y más préstamos…¡Es la edad de oro de las tarjetas de crédito, de los automóviles de lujo del año, de las grandes mansiones con piscina, de los viajes turísticos familiares a carísimos hoteles en las playas de Costa Rica! Con este escenario, era inevitable el colapso bancario. hombre Nike SB Zoom Bruin Premium Suede goma amarillo limón lavado se zapato cómodo,Pero de la esfera financiera, la crisis se traslada rápidamente a la economía real, dondeAir Jordan 1 retro Low og Pinnacle Metallic Plata Blanco 852549 003, la mayor parte de las empresas operan, crecen y se reproducen con dinero prestado. Entonces, si se contrae el crédito, se reduce al mínimo la contratación de nuevos trabajadores, o se despiden los que están empleados, pues no hay forma de que la empresa continúe su reproducción. Y si no se producen mercancías, el comercio exterior se contrae también, con lo cual la economía roza los niveles de la depresión. Estamos entonces frente a una espiral depresivaBasket Nike Kobe 10 - Taille 40,5,que ha sido recurrente en la historia económica del sistemaHombres de la moda de zapatillas Puma r698 trinomic 9,5 D M US, capitalista desde hace unos ciento cincuenta años, según se vio en la sección anterior. Como ha sido igual de recurrente el que estas situaciones críticas a quienes más perjudican es a los trabajadores, que ponen los muertos en este proceso, pues los capitalistas, para recuperar su capacidad de acumulación y reproducción, saquean la plusvalía acumulada, y despiden a sus empleados o recortan sus salarios, se deterioran las condiciones de trabajo, y los avances logrados por los trabajadores se bloquean o se limitan considerablemente. Por otro lado, esta nueva crisis contradice los postuladosAdidas Yeezy 350 V2 mantequilla DS condition.100% autentico.Nuevo con caja., de aquellos que sostenían que después del último evento similar en los años setenta, las Custom hombre Adidas mi energía Cloud Rojo comodo,economías europea, asiática, la de los países emergentes, como los del viejo socialismo, y la de los países dependientes o semi coloniales, no iban a verse impactadas por el episodio tal y como se ha ido desplegando en los Estados Unidos. Los procesos de globalización han globalizado, más que nunca, los mecanismos de acumulación a escala mundial, y las economías están hoy, como jamás lo estuvieron en el pasado, perfectamente sincronizadas. De tal forma que la teoría del "desacople" carece de sustancia si pensamos en que, los Estados Unidos continúan siendo, aunque precariamente, la locomotora de la demanda a escala internacional, y cualquier catástrofe en los patrones de consumo de la sociedad norteamericana, debería leerse como un derrumbe en los otros componentes de la acumulación a escala internacional. Si partimos del principio de que dos de las características más notables del capitalismo del siglo XXI son precisamente un aumento espectacular de la Excelente Nike Air Max 2018 698902-006 hombre sz 13, 47,5 EUR negro rojo azul,tasa de ganancia y la imposibilidad de una expansión de la acumulación, que permita ampliar y profundizar los procesos de reproducción del sistema, nos daremos de frente con el problema que representa para este último el que la desvalorización del capital, y su consecuente incremento en la extracción de plusvalor, impida la gestación de una nueva ola de modernización capitalista, tal y como la había pensado Schumpeter en sus mejores ensueños. Además, la caída del socialismo real, supuestamente, iba a lanzar unos 800hombre Jordania Eclipse negro / Universidad Rojo 724010 018 comodo, millones de nuevos consumidores sobre los bienes manufacturados por las naciones Adidas Zapatilla running zapato respuesta impulso mujeres negro 8m pre - owned LQ,industrializadas del viejo capitalismo, pero tal cosa sólo ha generado una nueva ola de preocupaciones para países como Austria, España, Francia, Alemania, Suiza y otros, quienes han prestado enormes cantidades de dinero a los viejos aliados de la fenecida Unión Soviética; y en estados como Hungría, la crisis ya asestó sus primeros golpes reduciendo de forma traumática su capacidad de pago, con lo cual se reducen también las posibilidades reales de la restauración capitalista en estas naciones. La situación con China es igualmente aleccionadora. Este gigantesco taller de manufacturas es el principalAir Jordan Cool Gris 3 III tamaño 10,5 Nike, abastecedor comercial de Europa y los Estados Unidos, tanto así como para que ciudades enteras hayan surgido en menos de veinte años, en su totalidad estructuradas para alojar principalmente a trabajadores extranjeros, procedentes de Hong Kong e Indochina, y dedicarse por completo a la fabricación de juguetes por ejemplo. La sobre acumulación[22] en China no ha tenido eco en su descomunal y lenta maquinaria política y administrativa, y, aunque la expansión comercial ha posibilitado alguna modernización de la estructura productiva, este país padece serios problemas laborales y sociales que están al borde de provocar una explosión sin precedentes en época de restauración capitalista, sobre todo en las ciudades costeras, totalmente volcadas a la satisfacción del comercio internacional. Por otro lado, aunque realmente nadie puede decir a ciencia cierta qué fue lo que pasó con el experimento soviético, despuéshombre Nike Flex 2018 RN zapatos Hyper naranja negro 898457 800, de más de ochenta años la única sensación real queBrad Nuevo nike Sprint pista Spikes / Flats hombre cómodo,queda de todo eso es que el régimen de planificación central pudo haber fallado en todo, menos en el cálculo de larga duración respecto a las orientaciones posibles de la teoría del valor, para justificar la represión del consumo y una cotidianidad en la que no contaban las opciones personales sino las preocupaciones estatales de largo plazo[23]. Es decir, la supuesta "acumulación socialista"[24] en países como China y la Unión Soviética nunca remontó los designios de la teoría del valor y se agotó en el impulso de una estructura productiva que ponía el énfasis sobre las cosas, antes que en las personas[25]. La producción y transferencia del excedente agrícola parahombre Nike Zoom Hyperfuse Army Print w / rojo zapatillas de tenis reducción de precio, impulsar el desarrollo industrial, postulado de Nike Zoom Superfly Elite Racing Spike Track running zapatos 6.5-12.5,clave del régimen de planificación central, y todavía vigente en la mayor parte de los países que se declaran a sí mismos como países socialistas, colapsaron en razón de los atajos burocráticos que tomaba el mencionado excedente. Era así, como entre otros recursos, se servía el socialismo burocrático de inspiración soviética para escamotear las crisis, según ocurriera en los años treinta y setenta del siglo pasado. Ahora resulta que la mayor parte de los países del viejo socialismo real se han convertido en losHombres Nike Lunar aparente atmósfera gris / rojo / negro / blanco 08987016 Universidad, principales clientes del crédito generado en Europa Occidental, Estados Unidos Hermosa mujer Houston Astros camiseta personalizada con auténtica joya Swarovski,y Asia, con lo cual todos los mecanismos de la acumulación socialista se han transferido a una "nueva acumulación primitiva", que tiende a fortalecer los sectores secundario y terciario, pero dejando intactos los lazos y relaciones de la vieja y corrupta burocracia del socialismo fracasado. La mayor parte de los grandes magnates que han surgido en Rusia, hombre nike air huarache cargo Khaki marca nueva talla 9,5,Ucrania, la República Checa, Polonia, Hungría y otras de estas naciones, está Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 v2 / US 9 / / 3 Zebra DS cp9654,constituida por un grupo de funcionarios que asaltaron y cooptaron las estructuras burocráticas del socialismo real casi inmediatamente después del XX Congreso del Partido Comunista de la Unión Soviética en 1956, cuando Nikita Kruschev (1894-1971) hiciera las denuncias sobre los atroces crímenes de Stalin (1879-1953); una labor que esmeradamente se continuaría durante el régimen de Brezhnev (1906-1982), y se coronaría con éxito total durante la pomposa Perestroika impulsada por Gorbachov (1931- ), a partir de 1984 hasta el colapso definitivo de la Unión Soviética en 1991. Todo esto prueba que el socialismo burocrático estaba perfectamente bien preparado para recibir la restauración capitalista, y asestar a la clase trabajadora, de paso, uno de los golpes políticos más letales de que tenga memoria la historia social de los últimos doscientos años.

Rinden homenaje al Día Nacional del Acullico en Tarija y regalan hojas de coca a la población Rinden homenaje al Día Nacional del Acullico en Tarija y regalan hojas de coca a la población – La Voz de Tarija Según Ley Nacional viernes, 11 enero 2019 - 12:40 PM - Gabriela Flores Diferentes organizaciones sociales de Tarija se han reunido hoy en la plaza principal Luis de Fuentes y Vargas para rendir homenaje al Día Nacional del Acullico, donde se repartió hojas de coca a los participantes, según ha informado el dirigente nacional de comercializadores de hoja de coca, Felix Bolívar. "Hoy ha sido un acto especial en el que estamos conmemorando un día importante, el día nacional del acullico se lo está realizando a nivel nacional, hemos monitoreado nuestro presidente estaba en la plaza principal y aquí lo estamos haciendo de manera como dice la Ley que manda el Viceministerio de Coca, pero de instituciones solo están presentes la Federación de Campesinos", ha mencionado. Además ha señalado que el pijcheo ya se ha despenalizado en Bolivia porque se han conocido las grandes bondades que tiene la hoja de coca en el organismo y la salud. "El acullico ha sido despenalizado, el pijcheo y en otras partes le dicen el boleo, hoy no lo hacen solamente los campesinos, lo hacen también la gente profesional, los estudiantes, en realidad todos porque si se ha encontrado las caulidades y las bondades de la hoja de coca", ha rescatado. En este sentido, ha explicado que en Tarija la comercialización de coca se ha incrementado ya que son 800 los comerciantes que se dedican a la venta de la hoja sagrada. "Ha crecido, hoy tenemos a nive

Elegimos del menú indio después de confirmar que el chef era en efecto de la India. Qué delicia, 6 de nosotros tuvimos varias entradas que eran recién preparado, sabroso y abundante. Los platos principales eran...igual de buenos, de nuevo con opciones diferentes, todos nos dijeron que era una de las mejores comidas indias que hemos tenido. El chef (que es nuevo) salieron a ver si estábamos disfrutando de nuestra comida, lo cual hicimos, totalmente! El servicio era agradable y rápido. Si te gusta la comida sabrosa cocina india recién hecho, dar la TJA Kavi intentarlo. Nuestros amigos estaban alojados en el hotel y decía que el desayuno también era bueno.Más Parada sobre el hotel. . Cómodas camas, duchas. bueno, y la comida era excelente. El personal era amable y servicial. Decepcionante servicio y la comida era promedio Tuvimos que esperar más de 40 minutos para que los alimentos lleguen a pesar de restaurante sólo había unos pocos clientes. La comida era apenas tibia y decepcionante. Intentamos explicarle a camarero, pero su pobre inglés significaba que no podía entender lo que estaba tratando...de decir que cuando quería la comida climatizadaMás debsj71 Visitamos solos durante su estancia en el Ramada. Era muy gratamente sorprendido por la calidad de los alimentos. Menú conservador ofreció sólo relativamente suficiente donde elegir y a precios razonables para un restaurante de hotel. Yo opté por bhaji de cebolla y pollo tikka masala..... . regados con un pinot rose blush. Sencillamente divina. Personal muy atento, en particular, el director que era encantador. Gran final de un largo día :-).Más Entorno lúgubre y hosco personal Es una pena, porque me pareció que la comida india muy sabroso. He probado el cordero Masala y el cordero Karahi. Ambos excelentes. Pero el servicio era bastante chungo, sin olvidar nuestro pedido dos veces, sin olvidar llevar el arroz, ni siquiera comprobar si todo...estaba bien. Sin sonar demasiado UKIP, el personal de Europa Oriental estaban tristes hasta el punto de estereotipos. Ni sonrisas, ni saludo, ni de atención al cliente. Para el desayuno, nuestro "buenos días" fue respondido con un brusco número"? "Ni siquiera un por favor. Añadir a la que el entorno frío miserable - un gran conservatorio de upvc. Tiene todo el encanto de un mausoleo. No me alojaré allí de nuevo.Más Nos quedamos impresionados con la calidad de la comida. Decidimos cenar aquí ya había sido decepcionados con la comida ofrecida por el hotel cercano en el que nos alojábamos. Habiendo comido aquí antes, aunque hace varios años, esperábamos que fuera igual de bueno. Que era. No el menú más completo, pero nos gustó. No...tenía combinaciones convencionales de ensalada César/cóctel de gambas con el Cordero Rogan Josh, champiñones arroz frito, keema pan. Estaba muy bien preparado y delicioso y abundante. Bien hecho.Más Cenamos aquí como miembros de la sociedad, atraído por Gourmet esta descripción en su sitio web del restaurante: 'con vistas al río Avon, en un lado y el otro, ROLLING MEADOWS el restaurante TJA Kavi está situado idilicamente en las profundidades de Warwickshire. Ambiente lujoso...que irradia un discreto para aquellos que quieran probar la cocina india de fusión audaz." Bien, estoy seguro de que el río Avon y idílica campiña Warwickshire fue otro, pero la mayoría lo que ves es césped descuidado y flores a través de los ventanales de suelo a techo, estropeado pavimento y vallas/dependencias que están en necesidad de reparación y una mano de pintura! (ver mis fotos.) Es una pena, porque alguien una vez fuimos a algunos problemas de diseño y equipar este restaurante y crear algo diferente de su experiencia india estándar. Pero audaz fusión de cocina india? Yo no lo creo! Y por desgracia, la comida no tuvimos la oportunidad, como el ambiente era horrible! En el fondo era un ruido de algo indeterminado tipo de música, tratando de competir con el aire acondicionado. Nuestra llegada led desde el aparcamiento a la entrada del restaurante que estaba rodeado de chatarra de metal, estaba cerrada y el vestíbulo lleno de una pila de sillas y una caja de cartón! Esto significaba que teníamos que ir andando a la puerta del hotel, después volver a través de pasillos donde aburrido habíamos empezado! Anunció nuestra llegada y referencia de reserva, que parecía irrelevante, ya que el personal no tenía idea sobre la oferta gourmet de la sociedad, no reconocer nuestra reserva o ofrecen una bienvenida, aunque finalmente confirma la gerencia no ofrecen. Claro, la comida estaba bien y servid

Inicio Noticias de Venezuela Dos chamos desaparecidos de una fiesta el sábado, aparecieron sin vida en... Carlos Alberto Torres y Carlos Leonel Posada, de 27 y 24 años de edad respectivamente, asistieron a un local nocturno sin saber que sería la última vez que lo iban a pisar. Fueron vistos el 19 de marzo a eso de las 9 de la noche en el Barrio Primero de Mayo. Según compañeros de fiesta, iban a comprar unos perros calientes para cenar. Los dos hombres salieron en búsqueda de comida rápida para continuar con la fiesta, sin embargo, fueron asesinados en la madrugada. Luego de cometer el crimen, dejaron los dos cuerpos abandonados en Yogore. Este caserío está ubicado muy cerca del sitio donde se efectuó la fiesta, a unos 20 kilómetros. Uno de sus amigos salió el ruedo para declarar sobre el caso: «Los dos tenían hambre y quisieron comprar unos perros calientes, pero nunca volvieron. Por más que les llamamos a sus teléfonos, tampoco contestaron ni respondieron los mensajes». Por su parte, la novia de Torres subió un estado de WhatsApp averiguando si alguien sabía algo de él, alegando que lo extrañaba demasiado. VER TAMBIÉN: Crimen pasional en Zulia. Mató a su esposa y luego se suicidó tras dejar a sus hijos en la escuela Lo más curioso del asunto es que un amigo en común de ellos residenciado en Perú, se enteró de primera fuente que Torres y Posada murieron en Yogore mucho antes que su novia y el círculo de amigos que estaban reunidos. «Me aviso que el Niño (apodo) lo habían matado y lo encontraron sin vida en Yogore

Seguro en el trabajo - Univision Julie Stav te informa de tus derechos si te lesionas en el trabajo, incluso si eres un indocumentado en algunos estados. Publicado: ago 03, 2008 | 05:08 PM EDT Hablar de las cosas desagradables que nos pudieran ocurrir en la vida es lo menos que queremos hacer, pero a veces -por aquello de "persona precavida vale por dos"- las consecuencias serán mucho menores si estamos preparados para lo que podría suceder. ¿Sabes cuáles son tus derechos si resultas lesionado en el trabajo? Si tu respuesta es no, es esencial que te informes cuanto antes, pues esos casos pasan a diario en todas las empresas de este país.Lo primero que debes saber es que todo patrón tiene la obligación, ordenada por la ley, de cubrirte con un seguro de compensación laboral o worker's compensation en caso de una lesión, enfermedad producida por el ambiente de trabajo o muerte durante el desempeño de tu labor.El empleador que no tenga esa cobertura se expone a serias demandas por parte del empleado que haya sufrido uno de esos eventos, o sus familiares. Y para los latinos es de principal importancia saber que en algunos estados del país esta responsabilidad del patrón incluye también a empleados indocumentados. Esos estados son, hasta ahora: California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsilvania, Tennessee y Virginia. Cuídate mientras trabajas y asegúrate de que las condiciones que ofrece tu empresa no ofrecen peligro para ti. P

Brasil tiene en promedio mejor desempeño en compromiso cívico, pero su desempeño es menor en promedio en ingreso, empleo, educación, salud, relaciones sociales, satisfacción ante la vida. Estos resultados se basan en una selección de datos disponibles. Aunque el dinero no puede comprar la felicidad, es un medio importante para lograr estándares de vida más elevados. En Brasil, el ingreso familiar disponible neto ajustado promedio per cápita es menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 30 490 USD al año. En términos de empleo, cerca del 57% de las personas de 15 a 64 años de edad en Brasil tienen un empleo remunerado, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 66%. Cerca del 67% de los hombres tienen un empleo remunerado, en comparación con el 47% de las mujeres. En Brasil el 7% de los empleados tienen un horario de trabajo remunerado muy largo, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 10%; el 7% de los hombres trabajan con remuneración muchas horas en comparación con el 4% de las mujeres. Tener un buen nivel educativo y de competencias es un requisito importante para encontrar empleo. En Brasil, el 57% de los adultos de 25 a 64 años han terminado la educación media superior, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 79%. Sin embargo, esto se aplica más en el caso de las mujeres que en el de los hombres, ya que el 53% de ellos han terminado con éxito la educación media superior en comparación con el 60% de las mujeres. En términos de calidad de la educación, el estudiante promedio obtuvo un resultado de 400 puntos en lectura, matemáticas y ciencias en el Programa para la Evaluación Internacional de Alumnos (PISA, por sus siglas en inglés) de la OCDE. Este resultado es menor que la media de la OCDE de 488. En promedio en Brasil, las niñas superaron a los niños por 6 puntos, diferencia ligeramente mayor que el promedio OCDE de 5 puntos. En el campo de la salud, en Brasil la esperanza de vida al nacer es de 76 años, cinco años menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 81 años. La esperanza de vida para las mujeres se sitúa en los 80 años, en comparación con 72 para los hombres. El nivel de partículas atmosféricas PM2.5 —partículas contaminantes del aire lo suficientemente pequeñas como para penetrar en los pulmones y dañarlos— es de 11.7 microgramos por metro cúbico, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 14 microgramos por metro cúbico. En Brasil, el 70% de las personas dicen estar satisfechas con la calidad del agua, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 84%. En lo que concierne al ámbito público, en Brasil hay un moderado sentido de comunidad y altos niveles de compromiso cívico: el 83% de las personas creen conocer a alguien en quien pueden confiar cuando lo necesiten, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 91%. La participación electoral, una medida de la participación ciudadana en el proceso político, fue del 80% durante elecciones recientes. Esta cifra es mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 68% y refleja la práctica de votación obligatoria de Brasil. La situación económica y social puede afectar la tasa de votación; la participación electoral de la población que ocupa el 20% superior de la escala de ingresos se estima en 81% y para la que ocupa el 20% inferior, se estima en 79%. Al pedírseles que calificaran su satisfacción general ante la vida en una escala de 0 a 10, los brasileños le otorgaron una calificación promedio de 6.1, cifra menor al promedio de la OCDE de 6.7. Brasil en Detalle Vivienda – Brasil más Además de los costos de vivienda, es importante estudiar las condiciones de vida, como el promedio de habitaciones compartidas por persona y si las viviendas tienen acceso a servicios básicos. El número de habitaciones de una vivienda, dividido entre el número de personas que la habitan, indica si los residentes viven en condiciones de hacinamiento. Una vivienda superpoblada puede tener un impacto negativo en la salud física y mental, en las relaciones con otras personas y en el desarrollo de los hijos. Asimismo, el hacinamiento suele traducirse en un suministro inadecuado de agua y de servicios de alcantarillado. En Brasil, el hogar promedio tiene un número de habitaciones por persona menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 1.7. En términos de servicios básicos, 93.3% de las viviendas en Brasil que tienen acceso privado a inodoros interiores con descarga de agua, una cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 97%. Ingresos – Brasil más El ingreso familiar disponible neto ajustado es la cantidad de dinero que una familia percibe, o gana, cada año después de impuestos y transferencias. Representa el dinero del que dispone una familia para gastar en bienes o servicios. En Brasil, el ingreso familiar disponible neto ajustado promedio per cápita es mucho menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 30 490 USD. El patrimonio familiar neto es el monto total de los activos financieros y no financieros que posee una familia, como dinero o acciones en cuentas bancarias, la residencia principal, otros bienes inmuebles, vehículos, objetos de valor y otros activos no financieros (por ejemplo, otros bienes de consumo duraderos). En Brasil, el patrimonio familiar neto es considerablemente menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 323 960 USD. Empleo – Brasil más Tener empleo aporta muchos beneficios importantes, incluyendo proporcionar una fuente de ingresos, la mejora de la inclusión social, satisfacer las aspiraciones personales, fortalecer la autoestima y desarrollar capacidades y competencias. En Brasil, el 57% de la población en edad laboral (entre 15 y 64 años) tiene un empleo remunerado. Esta cifra es menor que el promedio de empleo de la OCDE de 66%. La definición de desempleado se refiere a aquellos que no trabajan actualmente pero que están dispuestos a hacerlo y que están buscando empleo activamente. El desempleo a largo plazo puede tener un gran efecto negativo en los sentimientos de bienestar y autoestima, y genera la pérdida de capacidades, con lo que las posibilidades de conseguir empleo se reducen aún más. En Brasil, el porcentaje de la fuerza laboral que ha estado desempleada durante un año o más es en la actualidad mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 1.3%. Los salarios y los otros beneficios monetarios que aporta el empleo son aspectos importantes de la calidad en el empleo. Los brasileños ganan menos que el promedio de la OCDE de 49 165 USD. Otro factor esencial de la calidad en el empleo es la seguridad en este, en términos de la pérdida esperada de ingresos cuando alguien queda desempleado. Esto incluye el grado de probabilidad de perder el empleo, la duración del probable periodo de desempleo y cuánta ayuda financiera puede esperarse del gobierno. Los empleados que corren un riesgo más alto de perder su empleo son más vulnerables, en especial en países con sistemas de seguridad social más reducidos. En Brasil, los trabajadores afrontan un riesgo estimado de pérdida de ingresos en caso de quedar desempleados mayor que el promedio de la OCDE de 5.1%. Los empleos informales ponen a los trabajadores bajo riesgo de recibir menos sueldo, prestaciones y protección legal. En Brasil, la tasa de informalidad bajó más de 12 puntos porcentuales desde 2000, debido a la combinación de un crecimiento económico más fuerte e intervenciones específicas de políticas públicas. El país es ahora uno de los casos de mayor éxito en América Latina en lo que se refiere a reducir la informalidad. Estudios realizados sugieren que disminuir los trámites administrativos para registrar a una pequeña empresa con hasta un empleado, lo que incluye la posibilidad de registrarla siguiendo unos cuantos pasos en línea y reglas más sencillas para cumplir con los pagos de impuestos y contribuciones, ayudó a la formalización de cerca de 500 000 microempresas y cerca de dos millones de empleos durante cinco años. Al mismo tiempo, la experiencia de Brasil muestra que dichos programas implican compensaciones, ya que un trato demasiado diferente entre las empresas pequeñas y las grandes puede reducir los incentivos para que los negocios crezcan. Comunidad – Brasil más Educación – Brasil más Una población bien educada y bien capacitada es esencial para el bienestar social y económico de un país. La educación desempeña un papel fundamental para proporcionar a las personas los conocimientos, las capacidades y las competencias necesarias para participar de manera efectiva en la sociedad y en la economía. Tener una buena educación mejora en gran medida la probabilidad de encontrar empleo y de ganar suficiente dinero. Los brasileños pueden esperar pasar 16.2 años en el sistema educativo entre los 5 y los 39 años de edad, cifra menor que el promedio de la OCDE de 18 años. Obtener un título de educación media superior cobra una creciente importancia en todos los países, ya que las competencias necesarias en el mercado laboral se basan cada vez más en los conocimientos. Por consiguiente, las tasas de graduación del bachillerato indican con claridad si un país está preparando a sus estudiantes para cubrir los requerimientos mínimos de ese mercado laboral. En Brasil, el 57% de los adultos entre 25 y 64 años de edad ha terminado la educación media superior, cifra mucho m

Perciben restauranteros aumento turístico pero poca derrama | Novedades Quintana Roo Si bien los restauranteros notan que hay más afluencia de turistas en Playa del Carmen, advierten que eso no es garantía de una aumento en sus ganancias. (Archivo/SIPSE) PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Q. Roo.- Clubs de Playa y restaurantes de la Quinta registraron a partir de este fin de semana un aumento del flujo de visitantes en la zona turística y de playas, sin embargo no se está reflejando de la misma manera en el consumo. En promedio dicen que un cliente nacional gasta entre 120 y 150 pesos y un extranjero entre los 200 y 220 pesos por visita a ese tipo de lugares. Cesar Navarro Medina, gerente del establecimiento Pez Vela con más de 10 años en la industria restaurantera, indica que desde el inicio del pasado fin de semana se la logrado percibir el aumento en la afluencia del turismo sobre la Quinta Avenida, aunqu

La automotriz Volkswagen anunció hoy el despido de 30 mil trabajadores en todo el mundo, de los cuales 7 mil serán en Argentina y Brasil, lo que agravará aún más la crítica situación que enfrenta el sector en el país por la recesión. En la Argentina, Volkswagen cuenta con 6.000 trabajadores en las dos plantas industriales en General Pacheco (Buenos Aires) y en Córdoba. Al igual que las demás terminales locales, la compañía alemana tuvo que adelantar vacaciones y suspender personal para enfrentar el estancamiento que tiene la industria y principalmente el rubro automotriz. "Si no protegemos la industria vamos a perder puestos de trabajo. Ahora no perdimos, pero hay licenciamiento. No sé después de fin de año, si esto no se revierte, hasta cuándo vamos a sostener el li

En ese sentido el presidente del máximo gremio empresarial señala al Gobierno de irresponsable por no haber tomado las medidas correspondientes ante la crisis actual que atraviesa el país. "Que el Ejecutivo mantenga sin tomar los correctivos necesarios para recuperar al país raya en lo irresponsable; el exceso de controles y un creciente alejamiento de los principios democráticos solo nos ha traído la destrucción del aparato productivo nacional", señala el comunicado.

El Papa concede personalidad jurídica canónica pública a Caritas Internationalis 2004-11-17 11:36:55 Juan Pablo II ha concedido la personalidad jurídica canónica pública a Caritas Internationalis, vinculándola más estrechamente a Su persona y a la Santa Sede. Y favoreciendo así una colaboración más eficaz con el Pontificio Consejo Cor Unum, dicasterio al que el Santo Padre ha confiado la tarea de promover y coordinar las iniciativas de las instituciones católicas en el campo humanitario. Cor Unum "contribuirá así a mantener vivo el espíritu eclesial en la Confederación de Caritas, dado el papel eclesial de esta benemérita institución, y en particular vigilará la actividad de los miembros de la misma, que se desarrollará en coordinación internacional y en colaboración directa con las Iglesias locales y sus Pastores". Asimismo, Caritas Internacional por su actividad caritativa a nivel mundial, sobre todo ante los organismos internacionales y en zonas del mundo en dificultad, siempre hará referencia a la Secretaría de Estado. Por la especial vinculación de Caritas Internationalis con la Santa Sede, la lista de los candidatos a la función de presidente y secretario general de la Confederación tendrán que ser sometidos a la aprobación del Papa. El Santo Padre ha confirmado los Estatutos y el Reglamento de Caritas, que, sin embargo, tendrán que ser interpretado

LA FERIA DE LA INFORMACION: Cultura: YO LEO, ¿TÚ LEES? ¿NOSOTROS LEEMOS? Cultura: YO LEO, ¿TÚ LEES? ¿NOSOTROS LEEMOS? Joaquín Salvador Lavado(Quino) Ayer por la tarde, más por obligación que por gusto mío, empecé a arreglar mis estantes de libros. No se trata precisamente de una biblioteca, pues son muy pocos mis libros para llegar a ser una: apenas unos doscientos libros de todas las épocas. Limpiando cada uno de ellos recordé las horas de placer que me han regalado y el refugio que han representado para mí en diferentes momentos de mi vida, grandes compañeros que me dieron grandes lecciones. He leído desde que aprendí que las pequeñas letras podían significar algo y nunca he parado. Mi abuelo sí tenía una biblioteca, toda una habitación llena de libros que nunca me pidió leer: él, aun al borde de la ceguera, sólo leía frente a mí, y eso fue más que suficiente, empecé por imitarlo y acabé disfrutándolo. Tardes y tardes enteras nos sentamos en un cuarto miniatura de dos por tres metros, a leer cada cual un libro... ocasionalmente me comentaba algo de lo que él leía y despertaba mis deseos de leer el libro que él había elegido. A veces se dormía con el libro en la mano, de tan viejito que estaba y yo aprovechaba para averiguar el título y anotarlo en una libretita que tenía con el nombre: "Los libros que el abuelo dice que debo leer" y en verdad los leí casi todos. Libros por necesidad de conocimiento académico o libros por distracción, he leído de todo y ello me ha dado facilidad para respetar las reglas de ortografía, escribir y expresarme. He conocido a personas que comparten ese gusto conmigo y me encantaría decir que es una costumbre que comparto con mi familia, pero no sería del todo la verdad. Mis dos hermanos menores no disfrutan de la lectura como yo, salvo ocasionalmente cuando según ellos "la obra lo amerita". Criados de la misma forma los tres, me resisto a pensar que se trate de una cuestión de personalidad, pues ello significaría que en el país, muchos son los que no la tienen. Intentando entender cuál es la diferencia entre los que leen y los que no, sobre todo en nuestro país encontré varias referencias. Primero: el famoso Plan Lector, puesto en marcha por Alejandro Toledo en el 2004, que se supone sea un impulso a la lectura es, según numerosos pedagogos y sociólogos, la manera más negativa de hacer que los niños lean. Según Ana Díaz-Plaja Taboada, docente de la Universidad de Barcelona, cuando se obliga a leer a los niños, ven el libro como algo alejado de las "distracciones" que realmente les gustan, y, en cambio, lo identifican como algo muy próximo a los deberes escolares. Y eso es lo que hace el Plan Lector, planteado como una iniciativa para reducir los índices de analfabetismo y luego un plan maestro para incentivar la lectura, considero que para ambos objetivos es un plan inútil. Nadie va a leer obligado por sus profesores, en un ambiente académico tradicional y condicionado por sus notas escolares. Segundo: si es necesario tener un ambiente familiar que a través del ejemplo y las lecturas de cuentos a los niños impulse la lectura ¿tendremos pronto una generación de niños y adolescentes lectores de verdad? En la Región del Cusco, según el último Censo del 2007 realizado por el INEI, 193 mil 558 cusqueños no saben leer ni escribir. ¿Alguien ha censado a las personas que saben leer y escribir pero que no entienden lo que leen? Ese probablemente sea uno de los problemas educativos más graves del Perú, pues de otro modo podríamos ser autodidactas para aprender lo que no nos proporcionan en los colegios, por ejemplo: muchos peruanos no entendemos lo que leemos. En mi opinión personal se trata de un tema de ambientes, personas y métodos. Un ambiente en que el niño o adolescente se sienta cómodo, en confianza y se estimule su interés o curiosidad es una buen punto de inicio. Una persona de confianza y a quien el niño respete, es quien debe servirle de modelo: nadie leerá si no ve a otro leyendo, nadie leerá si no despiertan su interés por el libro. El tema de las recomendaciones y los ejemplos, es la mejor forma de hacer leer a otra persona... también adultos, aunque ellos probablemente abandonen el libro en favor de sus obligaciones diarias. Para concluir, me gustaría citar al catedrático Luis Jaime Cisneros, quien en un artículo que me gustaría analizar más extensamente en la próxima edición de La Feria, menciona " (...) El Plan Lector merece apoyo cierto y presuroso. No consiste en aplaudir la iniciativa, sino en ayudarla a desenvolverse por cauces adecuados. Por lo pronto, como toda campaña, exige tener una idea clara (y científicamente correcta) de qué es lo que se quiere impulsar. El plan lector busca despertar el interés, el hábito de la lectura. Ante todo, es necesario tener idea muy precisa de lo que la lectura significa. Todav

Gurudev Siddha Peeth, abril de 2006— el verano en todo su esplendor. El brillo dorado del sol naciente hacía que todo resplandeciera. Yo iba al comedor de Annapurna para desayunar. Los pájaros gorjeaban. Los altos árboles seducían. La suave brisa se mecía en la atmósfera llena de shakti. Al tomar la curva del sendero de Ganesha, vi a Gurumayi caminando en mi dirección. Los rayos dorados del sol la inundaban y ella parecía un cúmulo de radiante luz azafrán. Gurumayi caminaba tan ligera que de inmediato estuvimos una frente a otra.

AnteriorPublicación anterior:Barrios en Londres, quedó cerca de dar la marca a TokioSiguientePublicación siguiente:Daniela Campuzano cerró en el lugar 27 en Cross Country de la Copa del Mundo de Ciclismo de Montaña Cruz Azul, Toluca, Puebla, Dorados, son algunos equipos que al igual que el América se han encontrado en medio de una polémica por supuestas alineaciones indebidas. En la mayoría de los casos los clubes han salido airosos, pero sí se han registrado sanciones. En el caso del América, se juzga al árbitro, según lo publicado por la Comisión Disciplinaria, y las Águilas podrían salir con los tres puntos que ganaron en el juego contra el Atlas. Cruz Azul perdió una semifinal contra Pachuca en el Clausura 2007, debido a que alinearon a Salvador Carmona, jugador que estaba suspendido de por vida por doping. Decio de María, entonces secretario General de la Federación Mexicana de Futbol, informó la decisión. Toluca reclamó una alineación indebida del Cruz Azul, debido a que La Máquina Celeste registró al mediocampista Alan Vidal, pero en la banca estuvo Jesús Lara. Los escarlatas perdieron el compromiso en la cancha y reclamaron por la vía administrativa, pero la Comisión Disciplinaria resolvió que no había “elemento alguno para determinar alineación indebida”. Dorados de Sinaloa perdió un parido contra Leones Negros, de Copa Mx, porque se presentó a jugar con sólo 11 jugadores con participación en el primer equipo y no con 12, como estipulaba el reglamento de competencia. El equipo de Culiacán fue sancionado con una derrota y una multa de mil UMAS. El mediocampista Gerson Torres estuvo a punto de debutar con el América, en un juego contra Pumas en el Clausura 2017, pero de último momento salió de la alineación. Todo debido a que la Liga MX le informó a los de Coapa que el Tico no podía participar, debido a que fue registrado en la Sub 20 y de hacerlo las Águilas incurrirían en una alineación indebida. En el 2020, el Tico comentó en una entrevista que no triunfó con los Azulcremas, entre otras cosas, por ese incidente. En el Apertura 2018, Cruz Azul Femenil fue señalado por registrar a Mercedes Rodríguez como asistente técnica, en la última jornada del campeonato y pese a que ya hab

Se trata de los padres de Borja, un niño de un año y medio de vida que sufre atrofia muscular espinal, según detalló 24 HORAS LEA TAMBIÉN..Noticias Chile | Revisa aquí si eres beneficiario del bono de 500 mil pesos del gobierno La madre contó a TVN que Borja tenía dos meses de vida cuando se le diagnosticó esta grave enfermedad, que le impide moverse y respirar con normalidad. "Cuando hicimos el diagnóstico se nos vino el mundo abajo (…) pero hace un año, buscando información en las redes encontramos que se aprobó un medicamento nuevo, único en su tipo y mejor que el que tiene actualmente", señaló María José Caro, mamá de Borja. "Lo que queremos es disminuir el riesgo de muerte por fallas respiratorias", señaló la madre al medio ya citado. "Actualmente es la única terapia génica en el mundo para tratar la atrofia muscular espinal. Zolgensma repara el error genético y ayuda a que su función motora y neuronal funcione.

La educación en Tarragona es para el desarrollo integral de la persona y no es el hecho de formar seres dóciles, automatizados y capaces sólo de generar, vender y consumir. Los colegios en Tarragona ofrecen actividades extraescolares como un complemento a la escolarización de vuestros/as hijos/as para de este modo contribuir a su desarrollo como personas y desarrollar sus capacidades y competencias físicas, intelectuales, artísticas y de habilidades sociales. Las actividades extraescolares están presentes en todos los colegios de Tarragona , desde idiomas para reforzar el inglés o bien iniciarse con el chino, hasta actividades deportivas como deportes en conjunto. Como padre, debe buscar las mejores escuelas para sus hijos y sería aconsejable,si verdaderamente quiere lo mejor para su hijo, que visitara todos los colegios en Tarragona para elegir el mejor instituto de la zona. En la enorme mayoría de los colegios de Tarragona se imparten cursos de idiomas fuera del horario escolar para fortalecer o ampliar los conocimientos de los niños. Durante la educación en Tarragona obligatoria debería trasmitirse a los jóvenes el aprendizaje para toda la vida, el aprender a aprender, que el paso por la escuela debe ser tan gratificante que induzca a las personas a ser siendo conscientes de que siempre y en toda circunstancia estamos aprendiendo.

Suñén: Emparejando calcetines Se lo leo a ustedes en voz alta: ¿Acabarán algún día las guerras y el sufrimiento? ¿Qué nos sucede al morir? ¿Hay alguna esperanza para los muertos? ¿Cómo tenemos que orar para que Dios nos escuche? ¿Encontraremos la felicidad? Son preguntas que he encontrado en un panfleto que alguien, posiblemente un joven manipulado por sus cofrades de más edad, ha dejado en nuestro buzón de Magaz de Abajo. Como ahora soy pobre me sobra el tiempo, así que lo dedico a cepillar al gato, hacerle más caso a Raquel, atender los sabios consejos de mi hijo Lucas, vestirme a la oriental, leer panfletos absurdos (incluido el periódico) y sacar conclusiones. La parte más difícil es sacar conclusiones, porque con las conclusiones pasa lo mismo que con la meditación trascendental: – Estoy meditando. – Ya me has distraído. Las conclusiones deben salir de alguna parte, a ser posible de una meditación no trascendental y, desde luego, deben exhibir cierta intención de servicio público. Servidor, sin ir más lejos, llegó el otro día a la conclusión de que lo que le ha ocurrido al capitalismo neo liberal es que se ha muerto. Saqué mi conclusión emparejando calcetines. Emparejar calcetines es una de esas actividades que deberían ser obligatorias en las carreras universitarias, incluso en los másteres esos que los jóvenes no entienden. Se pone uno a emparejar calcetines y descubre inmediatamente que las cosas no están tan mal como parecían en un principio. Servidor, miren ustedes por donde, ha resultado ser poseedor de una cantidad de pares de calcetines que, en un principio, duda mucho que pudiesen igualar los vestidores de los líderes de los principales partidos políticos del país, incluido el gobernante. Y los de los banqueros menos todavía. Me preguntaba, emparejando calcetines, por qué me he dedicado a la poesía en lugar de ser, por ejemplo, cucharero, o belga por citar dos profesiones que, al haber estado en crisis desde el siglo doce, no han advertido el penoso momento que atraviesan nuestros gestores. Nuestros gestores están en crisis, nosotros no. Nosotros tenemos calcetines para toda la semana. El caso es que me siento estupendamente sabiendo que gracias al tiempo libre que me proporciona la pobreza no volveré a salir a la calle con calcetines de distinta altura, o mal zurcidos. – ¿Has bebido? Es indignante escuchar ciertas cosas de un ser que, por su propia naturaleza, es incapaz de valorar la importancia de disponer de calcetines, así que ignoro el comentario de Pangur (que, por cierto, lleva dos días intentando aprender a caminar sobre la nieve), me sirvo otra copa del aguardiente de siempre y me digo a mí mismo: «Suñén, deja de hablar con felinos y recuerda lo que te dijo tu padre: El buen estratega nunca se quita los zapatos». A ustedes les parecerá una tontería, pero mi padre era un poquito zen. Y además: vivimos rodeados de tonterías. Mire donde mire, no veo más que tonterías. En la televisión, que se ha convertido inexplicablemente en un referente (porque la gente no empareja calcetines, sino que se queda mirándola y luego no puede salir a la calle sin hacer el ridículo) dicen que una niña musulmana tiene derecho a hacer gimnasia con velo. Sí. Y servidor tiene derecho a hacer el amor totalmente vestido de buzo, y a ir al cielo si reza como Dios manda (lo dice el panfleto). Los derechos son así. Pero ya antes de emparejar calcetines servidor se preguntaba: ¿Es el velo impedimenta cultural o impedimento personal? ¿Las musulmanas se duchan con velo? ¿Debo ducharme con calcetines? ¿Peco si hago gimnasia sin la medallita de la comunión p

En un primer post, os contamos toda la verdad sobre las bolas chinas. En él descubrimos cómo elegir una bolas chinas. En esta ocasión, te dejamos este articulo que explica muy bien, cuando se recomienda (o no) su uso, cómo ponerlas y qué hacer con ellas. Así que atenta!! Cómo poner las bolas chinas La postura para colocarlas es indiferente, se recomienda ponerlas con las rodillas y caderas flexionadas. Se deberían colocar como un tampón, al final de la vagina. Otra opción es colocarlas de pie, con un pie subido encima de un taburete para poder acceder de forma fácil a la entrada de la vagina, siempre introduciéndola hasta el final. Poner un poco de lubricante de base acuosa si es necesario para favorecer el introducirlas. Nunca debe doler el introducir una bola china, si duele, puede ser que sea demasiado grande o que los músculos del suelo pélvico estén hipertónicos, con demasiada tensión muscular. Por ello, siempre su uso debe ser supervisado por un fisioterapeuta. Cuándo se recomienda usar las bolas chinas Realmente las podría usar cualquier mujer sana que tenga un minimo de tono y fuerza en su musculatura del suelo pélvico. Esto ultimo solo se puede saber tras una valoración funcional. Si una mujer tiene una hipotonía ( poco tono) de su musculatura y comienza a usar las bolas chinas, seguramente se le caerán y su situación empeorará. Estaria recomendado su uso : Como prevención antes de quedarnos embarazadas para tener un suelo pélvico tonificado. Tras dar a luz, una vez pasada la cuarentena y una vez que nos hayamos hecho una valoración. Generalmente tras dar a luz, la vagina se queda mas laxa, la apertura vaginal es mas grande y la musculatura del suelo pélvico hipotónica, asi que son muchas las mujeres que cuando toman la decisión de usar las bolas sin una valoración previa lo que les pasa es que se les salen, con la consiguiente frustación que esto crea es por ello que vamos a aclarar.. Mujeres adultas que realizan deportes hiperpresivos (correr, tenis…) que debilitan su suelo pélvico deben compensar con algún ejercicio especifico de suelo pélvico (aparte del uso de bolas hay otros ejercicios hipopresivos que deberían hacer estas mujeres ). Como prevención para la aparición de sintomatología como prolapsos, incontinencia durante la menopausia. No una vez que hayan aparecido ya!!! Mujeres con estreñimiento . Estos casos requieren siempre una valoración previa . Como ayuda en el tratamiento de las incontinencias de esfuerzo, mixtas, tras dar a luz y en disfunciones sexuales provocadas por debilidad siempre siguiendo las instrucciones del terapeuta que nos este tratando, nunca antes porque podemos empeorar el cuadro clínico. Cuando NO se recomienda el uso de las bolas chinas Embarazo. La musculatura de suelo pélvico ya soporta el aumento de peso del utero durante la gestación teniendo en cuenta también el componente hormonal de laxitud. Suelo pélvico muy hipotónico que no son capaces de realizar una contracción normal (Kegel). Prolapsos a partir del grado 2 ( en grado 1 habría siempre que valorar) Hipertonias del suelo pélvico . Antes de poder usar las bolas chinas, habrá que tratar esa musculatura para quitar la hipertonía y a partir de ahí empezaremos a fortalecer. Dolor Tras dar a luz sin haber hecho una valoración previa Tras cirugía pélvica sin haber hecho valoración previa Como hemos dicho antes, en fisioterapia, las bolas chinas las usaremos para aumentar el tono, ya que la vibración que produce una bola contenida en otra estimula esa contracción involuntaria. Un suelo pélvico tónico es capaz de mantener las vísceras pélvicas en su sitio (evitando los prolapsos) y mantener la continencia, sin que nosotros realicemos una contracción voluntaria del mismo. Cuanto debo llevarlas puestas y cómo trabajar con las bolas chinas Lo ideal es empezar por 10 minutos al dia e ir aumentando el tiempo. No se recomienda tener puestas las bolas chinas más de tres horas al dia, el exceso de contracción puede aumentar demasiado el tono y ser perjudicial. Una vez introducidas debemos trabajar con ellas puestas de modo que aumentemos la dificultad de los ejercicios Kegel . Podemos hacer ejercicos solo de contraer suelo pélvico y relajar, podemos contraer manteniendo la contracción unos segundos y relajar o también contraer en dos o tres veces contrayendo cada vez un poco mas (como dibujando una escalera con nuestra contracción ). ¿Realmente, son efectivas? Usándolas de forma correcta, es decir buscando la bola china adecuada a cada mujer y durante el tiempo correspondiente, los resultados son muy satisfactorios. Resumen antes de comprar unas bolas chinas: – Realizar una valoración del suelo pélvico para determinar la necesidad o no del uso de las bolas chinas – Elegir la talla y el peso correctos (según la valoración que nos han realizado) – Elegir marca y material de calidad – Importante elegir que sean fáciles de limpiar – Elegir siempre mejor un paquete de bolas chinas, que nos permitan hacer una trabajo progresivo de la musculatura. – Aprender a hacer los ejercicios de Kegel sin ellas con supervisión de un fisioterapeuta o matrona, habiendo realizando una valoración antes de trabajar con ellas. ¡Recuerda siempre que las bolas chinas pueden ser muy beneficiosas para el fortalecimiento del suelo pélvico siempre y cuando hagamos un uso correcto de ellas !!

La primera foto es de 1910, y la segunda, aunque es reciente, se ha quedado anticuada, debido a que es anterior a la apertura del centro comercial y zonas públicas de 'Muelle Uno'. Vemos una panorámica aérea de la zona más antigua del puerto malagueño, que abarca también parte del centro histórico. A simple vista vemos, como una diferencia destacable, más superficie contruida en el lateral norte del monte Gibralfaro, así como en el puerto, donde aún no se había construído el silo. En cambio, hay una diferencia entre la segunda foto y la situación actual. El edificio del silo y los almacenes laterales han desaparecido debido a las obras del plan del puerto.

Agenttravel.es - Noticias para el profesional del turismo - Barceló reclama por la vía civil la gestión del Palau de Congressos de Palma Barceló reclama por la vía civil la gestión del Palau de Congressos de Palma La demanda no exige ningún tipo de indemnización económica El Palau ha impuesto una multa de 15.307 euros a Ascender. La sociedad Barceló Eventos Empresariales ha interpuesto una demanda civil contra la decisión del consejo de administración del Palau de Congressos de Palma de Mallorca, de fecha 10 de diciembre de 2015, de desistir del procedimiento de licitación 1/2015, que supuso la no adjudicación de la gestión del Palau a esta empresa, según publica la prensa local. La demanda, que ya está a disposición de los servicios jurídicos de Palacio de Congresos de Palma S.A. para su análisis y contestación, reproduce los motivos de impugnación ya expuestos por parte de Barceló Eventos Empresariales en el recurso contencioso-administrativo actualmente en trámite judicial contra la decisión del Ayuntamiento de Palma de no ratificación. En la demanda formulada por parte de Barceló Eventos Empresariales se pide la adjudicación del contrato pero no se reclama ningún tipo de indemnización económica.

Warhamster Society: septiembre 2009 Peanas de molde Hoy me he puesto a hacer pruebas de pintura con mis enanos ( ya la publicaré) y al pegarlo a la peana he recordado que hace tiempo hice el tutorial de como hacer peanas de molde y aun estaba por ahi, asi que aprovecho y lo cuelgo aqui :P. Pongo sólo el link en lugar de las fotos porque son muchas! Tras mucho tiempo pensando en como haría las peanas de mis enanos y las de mis elfos de warhammer, llegué a ver la luz el otro día. las voy a hacer tal que así: http://usuarios.lycos.es/eltallerderiklok/fotos%20ws/peanas%20enanos%20wip%20a.JPG Pero hacer todas las peanas una a una me llevaría mucho tiempo, las miniaturas son difíciles de sujetar a la pizarra, y el dueño de una casa que yo me sé se quejaría de goteras al faltarle un trozo de su tejado, por lo que decidí hacer moldes pare poder hacerlas rápidamente. Vayamos con el tutorial paso a paso para hacer los moldes: Primero hay que hacer los cajones. Como no hay que hacer el molde en 2 piezas, queremos sacar la pieza entera, y las peanas tienen la base lisa, no hará falta poner una base de plastilina. Yo he usado una base de una lámina de acetato. Hay que p

Speech of Insulza to the 5th SIRG ministerial Dirección de América del Norte, Central, Caribe y Asuntos Hernisféricos DISCURSO DEL MINISTRO DE RELACIONES EXTERIORES DE CHILE, SEÑOR JOSÉ MIGUEL INSULZA EN LA XVII REUNION DEL GRUPO DE REVISION DE LA IMPLEMENTACION DE CUMBRES (GRIC) CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA, 7 DE JUNIO DE 1999 Es para mi un agrado inaugurar la segunda reunión a nivel de Cancilleres del Grupo de Revisión de la Implementación de Cumbres, después de la Cumbre de Santiago. El propósito de nuestro encuentro es efectuar una revisión general del proceso de implementación y seguimiento de los mandatos contenidos en el Plan de Acción de la II Cumbre de las Américas e intercambiar puntos de vista respecto a nuestro trabajo futuro. Desde nuestra reunión de Caracas, hemos avanzado vigorosamente en el cumplimiento de los compromisos asumidos por nuestros Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno en Santiago. Ello ha quedado de manifiesto en las reuniones realizadas por los Coordinadores Nacionales en octubre de 1998 en Washington y en marzo de este año en República Dominicana, en las que revisaron los avances en diez de los veintisiete temas de Plan de Acción. Para implementar el capítulo "Educación: La Clave para el Progreso", los Ministros de Educación de las Américas se reunieron en Brasilia, en julio de 1998, y aprobaron el Plan de Implementación del Capítulo Educación del Plan de Acción de la Cumbre, y su Mecanismo de Seguimiento, para cumplir con los mandatos de los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno en este ámbito. Aprobaron, asimismo, el Programa Interamericano de Educación, en cuyo contexto se han concretado ya seis iniciativas; y consideraron el trabajo del Grupo Interagencial que busca facilitar la cooperación de los organismos internacionales para el financiamiento de proyectos en materia educativa. En relación al caplítulo sobre "Preservación y Fortalecimiento de la Democracia, la Justicia y los Derechos Humanos", se revisaron los avances en diversos temas. En materia de Corrupción, se realizó en noviembre de 1998, en Santiago, el Simposio para el Fortalecimiento de la Probidad en el Hemisferio, que permitió el intercambio de experiencias sobre las instituciones y normas nacionales de los Estados miembros sobre probidad y ética cívica, consideró la experiencia de los organismos internacionales en la lucha contra la corrupción, la cooperación para el fortalecimiento institucional y la participación de la Sociedad Civil en este propósito. Mañana la Asamblea General considerará el seguimiento de estas actividades. En materia de lucha contra las drogas ilícitas, en el ámbito de CICAD se han realizado avances importantes en la aplicación de la Estrategia Antidrogas del Hemisferio. El Grupo de Trabajo sobre el Mecanismo de Evaluación Multilateral (MEM) ha dado pasos decisivos en la conformación de los indicadores y procesos de operación del MEM. Después de cinco períodos de reuniones se está por concluir el mandato que le fuera encomendado y el año 2000 comenzaremos a ponerlo en aplicación. La II Conferencia Especializada Interamericana sobre Terrorismo, celebrada en noviembre de 1998 en Mar del Plata, Argentina, recomendó la creación de un Comité Interamericano contra el Terrorismo, con el propósito de prevenir, combatir y eliminar los actos y actividades terroristas. Mañana la Asamblea General de la O.E.A., establecerá este nuevo órgano de cooperación interamericano. Para avanzar en el cumplimiento de los mandatos sobre "Fortalecimiento del Sistema de Justicia y de los Organos Judiciales", los Ministros de Justicia de las Américas se reunieron en Lima, en marzo de este año, considerando especialmente los temas de acceso a la Justicia, formación de jueces, fiscales y funcionarios judiciales, política carcelaria y penitenciaria, así como el fortalecimiento de la cooperación interamericana en este ámbito. Los Ministros asignaron a un grupo de expertos intergubernamentales la tarea de completar los estudios para establecer un Centro de Estudios de Justicia de las Américas. Con el propósito de avanzar en el cumplimiento de los mandatos sobre "Modernización del Estado en materias laborales", los Ministros del Trabajo de las Américas se reunieron en Viña del Mar, Chile, en octubre de 1998, y definieron en su Plan de Acción de Viña del Mar como prioridades los temas de empleo y mercado de trabajo, relaciones laborales y seguridad social. Asimismo establecieron dos grupos de trabajo, uno de los cuales estará específicamente dedicado a la "Modernización del Estado y de la Administración Laboral". Hoy y mañana debemos aprobar importantes propuestas dentro de la Asamblea General en otros dos temas de este capítulo, en "Sociedad Civil" la creación de la Comisión sobre la Participación de la Sociedad Civil en las actividades de la O.E.A.; y en 'Fomento de la Confianza y Seguridad entre los Estados", la Convención sobre Transparencia en la Adquisición de Armas Convencionales, nuevo paso pionero de las Américas en materia de cooperación para la Seguridad. También se han registrado avances significativos en el capítulo "Integración Económica y Libre Comercio". El establecimiento del Area de Libre Comercio de las Américas (ALCA) es tal vez la iniciativa económica más interesante y ambiciosa de alcance hemisférico. El proceso de negociación del ALCA se encuentra actualmente en una fase técnica. La falta de autorización para negociar por la vía rápida (fast-track), es un límite para el principal socio comercial hemisférico, aunque hasta ahora no ha impedido el desarrollo de las negociaciones en esta fase. Los efectos de la crisis financiera en los países de la región, también han repercutido en las negociaciones de

El gobierno recomendó no viajar a Epuyén y a la crisis sanitaria se suma la económica | Tiempo Argentino | Tiempo Argentino Las nueve muertes que ya provocó el brote de Hantavirus en la localidad chubutense de Epuyén constituyen el núcleo de una tragedia humana cuyas derivaciones dependerán en gran medida de la eficacia diagnóstica y de contención que pueda desplegar las autoridades sanitarias, pero también el epicentro de una crisis que amenaza a todos los pobladores de la llamada "comarca andina" del paralelo 42, que también integran las localidades de El Hoyo, Lago Puelo o El Maitén. Con sentido profiláctico, es cierto, las voces oficiales no hacen sino agravar el panorama. Adolfo Rubinstein, ex ministro y hoy secretario de Salud de la Nación, aseguró que "no recomendaría viajar a Epuyén y sus alrededores en este momento". Y un artículo de la agencia de noticias Télam (escrito por un periodista de Clarín) lo califica de "pueblo fantasma". Los rostros cubiertos por barbijos son la postal de Epuyén. Tony Reato, el intendente, explicó que se decidió que lo usen todos los empleados municipales que atienden al público. En la comuna repiten que "se puede ingresar y salir de la localidad sin problemas", que las actividades al aire libre "se realizan normalmente", y que los barbijos son "para cuidarlos y cuidarnos". En una villa que vive del turismo, Reato es tajante: "Estamos peor que en el peor mes del año". Lo efectos de la crisis sanitaria se extienden a toda la comarca andina. "El viernes nos reunimos con el ministro de la Producción. Está claro que económicamente el impacto será enorme", se lamenta Gustavo Flak, dueño de la hostería Las Pataguas, en el límite entre Epuyén y El Hoyo, y concejal de esta última localidad. "Esto se suma a lo que vienen sufriendo las economías regionales, con los tarifazos y el aumento de los combustibles. Y si bien no había una tremenda cantidad de reservas, las que hab

The Boys – Smash the hater eusantis Sin categoría 7 agosto, 2019 7 agosto, 2019 2 Minutes Vista The Boys, para mi gusto la mejor serie del momento. Aunque el final es puro "cliffhanger". Y eso, en una serie de tan pocos episodios, es algo negativo, no positivo. Porque a lo que se prestan las series de temporadas de tan pocos episodios es a hacer historias redondas.Y por eso The Boys no es una serie redonda. Es la última vuelta de tuerca al género superheroico, una serie basada en unos cómics que desconocía (no soy fan de los cómics en general), que en la pantalla se convierte en algo fresco y por momentos sorprendente dentro de ese género. Y desde luego, con ganas de ver más, que es de lo que se trata. Hasta que la fórmula se agote. Que se agote antes o después, claro, dependerá de lo buenos que sean los guiones de las siguientes temporadas, en si de verdad hay algo que contar, y no es todo una sucesión de violencias sin ton ni son. Como en toda serie donde el arco argumental de fondo importa poco, como esta, lo importante es que haya personajes carismáticos, de los que quieras saber más, eso, más allá de la novedad que supone en el género, es el punto fuerte de The Boys. Si se quiere rascar un poco más, y ver en esta serie una metáfora del baile entre la economía, el poder y la guerra, del que se vanagloriaba con terrible cinismo un premio Nobel de la Paz como Henry Kissinger… Pues sí, seguramente podamos comprar eso también. Así que algo de fondo hay, después de todo. Mención aparte, no he leído nada sobre ello, pero me lo imagino, el controvertido personaje de Profundo. ¿Un violador redimido? La de barbaridades que se tienen que estar soltando de esta serie, solo por eso. Ojo, no es qu

Biden pedirá USD 32 mil millones para Ucrania y contra el COVID-19 al Congreso | elPeriódico de Guatemala Biden pedirá USD 32 mil millones para Ucrania y contra el COVID-19 al Congreso – elPeriodico de Guatemala La Casa Blanca anunció el jueves que pidió al Congreso más de 32 mil millones de dólares para brindar ayuda humanitaria y militar a Ucrania y financiar también su nueva estrategia anticovid, dos asuntos que califica de «urgentes e inmediatos». Unos 10 mil millones de dólares se utilizarían para enviar armas defensivas a Ucrania, permitirle proteger su red eléctrica, combatir ciberataques y la desinformación, indicó el gobierno en un comunicado. Este dinero también permitirá a Estados Unidos financiar la respuesta contra Moscú, empezando por las sanciones contra oligarcas rusos. El Ejecutivo estadounidense pide en este paquete 22 mil 500 millones de dólares para luchar contra la pandemia, y señala que está «prácticamente» sin fondos federales en este asunto. Este dinero permitirá a Estados Unidos prepararse para eventuales nuevas variantes de coronavirus, evitar el cierre de comercios o escuelas, y financiar la distribución de vacunas en el exterior. Muchos legisladores conservadores han expresado reservas sobre el pedido del gobierno. «

Mayo 28, 2019 - 18:05 Bogotá, 28 may (EFE).- El Gobierno colombiano y representantes del sector privado presentaron este martes una alianza para sustituir por café los cultivos ilícitos sembrados en una localidad del departamento de Nariño, fronterizo con Ecuador. "Familias que antes estaban atormentadas por los cultivos ilícitos han encontrado aquí un espacio para dejar el camino de la ilegalidad y entrar al de la legalidad", afirmó el presidente colombiano, Iván Duque, en la presentación de la alianza, en la que también participa la Federación Nacional de Cafeteros (FNC), Nespresso y la Fundación Howard Buffett. Duque destacó que se contempla un esquema de agricultura por contrato en el que se establece un "precio fijo, justo, que les permite tener sostenibilidad en el tiempo" para mejorar su calidad de vida. "Por otro lado es una oportunidad que queremos se expanda en todo el territorio nacional", acotó el jefe de Estado, quien agregó que el programa va a funcionar como "una herramienta de transformación social". El presidente de la FNC, Roberto Vélez, afirmó que con la alianza se espera "devolverle la legalidad a los cultivos de café de El Rosario" y apoyar la sustitución de hectáreas sembradas con coca. "A esa erradicación hay que darle un piso económico para que sea sostenible en el tiempo y ese piso económico se lo estamos dando con la caficultura", señaló Véle

Medir la sección más larga de una sola varilla con una cinta métrica. 2 Cortar un tubo de PVC de 6 pulgadas de diámetro, utilizando una sierra para metales, para igualar la longitud de la sección de la barra más larga. Limpiar todas las rebabas de los extremos cortados del tubo con papel de lija de grano 200. 3 Adjuntar una correa de transporte. Corte dos ranuras de 1 pulgada de largo en diagonal a través de la tubería con un disco de corte unido a un taladro. Espacio de las ranuras 3 pulgadas de cada extremo del tubo, colocándolos en una línea aún más entre sí. 4 Inserte una correa ancha de acarreo de 1 pulgada, disponible donde se venden artículos deportivos, abajo a pesar de la ranura en un extremo de la tubería y hacia arriba a través de la ranura en el extremo opuesto. Enhebrar la hebilla en los extremos de la cinta y ajuste la hebilla juntos. 5 Dry-encajar una tapa de extremo PVC sólido a un extremo de la tubería y una tapa de extremo rosca en la conexión de PVC en el extremo opuesto. Trazar una línea alrededor de la tubería, en la b

Buenos días Capitán: Inflación y boquerones En Alemania, entre enero de 1922 y noviembre de 1923 la tasa de inflación acumulada ascendió a un billón por ciento. Para hacernos una idea del significado de esa cifra piénsese que el dinero suficiente para adquirir todas las viviendas del término municipal de Málaga no bastaría un par de años después para pagar una ración de boquerones. La hiperinflación. J.C. Martinez Coll Anotado por Índigo a las 12:21 a. m. Velamen: J.C. Martínez Coll, La ley de la selva O sea... que a callarse tocan ¿ no? no podemos decir ni pio de lo nuestro... jajajaja Y, ante una ración de boquerones, con su fino fresquito, ¿quien querrá comprar viviendas?. Además, se está desinflando el globo, parece... Eso supongo que explica muchas cosas que pasaron en Alemania despues ... Pero eso fue porque a nadie se lo "escurrió" la feliz idea de cambiar los productos cuyo valor infuye en el IPC, a´si como el porcentaje de influencia, como hicieron nuestros políticos viendo lo que se les venía encima tras desterrar la peseta. Es curioso que el IPC desde entonces sube un 4% aproximadamente, sin embargo, el nivel de vida sube más del 20% anualmente. Fïjate que lo que antes eran 20 durillos o menos (un café) en 5 años se ha puesto en 1,10 €, o seasé, 175 ptas. ¿A tu sueldo le ha pasado lo mismo? AL mio no, desdeluego, podría decir que en mi caso rondo el 400%de depreciación del nivel de vida en 5 años, ahí es nada, sin cambiar de trabajo ni nada, que es lo mejor de todo. Pero claro, hasta que lleguemos al billón ... pablo leval railfe dijo... En dos años, tu lo ha

Ensayo Pessoa: [Reis criticando a Caeiro - I] [Reis criticando a Caeiro - I] P or cierto que la obra tiene defectos, y defectos que, siendo para mí bien patentes, no empañan, salvo en lo poco que la empañan, la brillantez de la obra. Rasgó Caeiro la niebla cristiana, que encubre la naturaleza y las emociones que nacen de ella. Pero ni rasgó enteramente esa niebla, ni del todo la consiguió levantar delante de sus propios ojos. Ambas incompletitudes eran de esperar. Que no rasgase del todo esa niebla, era cierto de antemano, pues eso no podía ser obra de un hombre, sino de generaciones de hombres, que ni sólo una bastaría. Que no la apartase del todo frente a sus propios ojos también era de esperar; pues en su alma, como en la de todos nosotros, yacía, a pesar de la aspiración de objetivismo, el fermento subjetivista cristiano, que, sin que lo demos por tal, forma parte consubstancial de la esencia de nuestro ser espiritual. El más pagano de nosotros tiene que expresarse en un lenguaje cristiano, porque las palabras en sus relaciones entre sí y el sentido de cada una aisladamente (de por sí) están cristianizadas. Como ya no hablamos griego, tampoco pensamos griego. Por eso en la obra de Caeiro aparecen algunos elementos que, aunque no escondan su esencia, todavía la contradicen. Enumeraré esos elementos. Para enumerar primero, escogeré aquel que es el más evidente de todos: la forma poética adoptada, que es, para mí, inadmisible. Sé bien que esa forma tiene un ritmo propio, que ni se confunde con el ritmo de los versos libres de Whitman, ni con el de los versos libres de los franceses modernos. Ese ritmo, sin embargo, nace, en verdad, de la incompetencia de colocar el pensamiento dentro de moldes estables; facilita demasiado, para que lo podamos contar como valor. El objetivista debe, encima de todo, hacer de sus poemas objetos, con contornos definidos, procurando que obedezcan a leyes exteriores a sí mismos, como la piedra, cuando cae, obedece a la gravedad, que, siendo parte de la «lógica» de su movimiento, no es parte de su personalidad material, considerada exclusivamente como tal. Apuntaré, enseguida, como defecto –más grave para mí, aunque, bien lo sé, mucho menos grave para los otros– el baño tibio de emotividad cristiana en que algunos de los poemas están envueltos, la simbología cristista de la que algunos de ellos, incluso, se sirven. Planea sobre parte del libro un romanticismo naturalista como el que enseñaran a Europa los almibarados cánticos del abominable fundador de la orden franciscana. Por otros pasa, como materia estética, dispensable todavía, un soplo de mitología cristiana que desentona de la índole de la obra. Si la obra fuese de un cristiano o de un mero emotivo sin una filosofía sosteniendo su arte, se disculparía ese defecto, que, igualmente, no sería más que otro pecado contra la naturaleza. Pero en la obra d

1532 lecturas | El primero de los cursos de verano de la UNED en Alcalá la Real inaugura un verano repleto de actividades en la localidad. Los cursos de verano de la UNED en Alcalá la Real ya han comenzado. El pistoletazo de salida se daba con la presentación de los mismos esta tarde, con la presencia del Director del Centro Asociado de la UNED 'Andrés de Vandelvira' en la provincia de Jaén, Andrés Medina Gómez; el alcalde de la localidad, Carlos Hinojosa Hidalgo y la concejal de Educación, Ana Belén Serrano Serrano. En la mesa los acompañaban el director del primero de los cursos, 'Derechos humanos y democracia', el profesor Titular de Derecho Constitucional de la UNED, Juan Manuel Goig Martínez y el coordinador y Magistrado Director de Selección y Formación inicial de la Escuela Judicial del Consejo General del Poder Judicial, Jorge Jiménez Martín. Abrió la presentación el Magistrado Director de Selección y Formación inicial de la Escuela Judicial del Consejo General del Poder Judicial, Jorge Jiménez, que expresó su agradecimiento a la UNED así como a la Escuela Judicial y al Consejo General del Poder Judicial que 'permite la participación de 10 magistrados para que se puedan enriquecerse de los conocimientos y la participación que se van a dar en este curso'. Volvió a poner en relevancia su estrecha vinculación con la localidad, de la que es hijo adoptivo, y considera que 'venir a Alcalá es un lujo'. Los representantes de la mesa destacaron la importancia del tema, de total actualidad, que sirve para reflexionar sobre la sociedad actual y el devenir de la misma. Por su parte, el director del curso, Juan Manuel Goig, indicó que este curso servirá a los asistentes para saber 'cuál es nuestro índice de democracia' e invitó a los alumnos a participar de forma activa durante las ponencias. El director del Centro Asociado de la UNED 'Andrés Vandelvira' de la provincia de Jáen, Andrés Medina, incidió en el alto nivel del curso y puso en valor la comunión existente entre los cursos de verano de la UNED y la ciudad de Alcalá la Real. 'Los que estamos aquí somos inmigrantes por el conocimiento' afirmó Medina en referencia a los participantes que provienen de diferentes puntos geográficos para asistir a estas ponencias. Para finalizar, el alcalde de Alcalá la Real, Carlos Hinojosa, reafirmó el compromiso del Ayuntamiento por la educación y, de esta manera, su trabajo junto a la UNED para hacer posible estos cursos ya que la localidad se encuentra 'abierta al enriquecimiento'. Indicó que las temáticas escogidas para los cursos de verano responden a un 'arduo trabajo de forma conjunta entre la UNED y el área de Educación del Ayuntamiento'. En este caso, responden a temáticas que son de interés común para la población pero también poniendo 'el acento en determinadas cuestiones que para nosotros son fundamentales', recordó Hinojosa. Así, los temas a tratar girarán en torno a la educación y los nuevos desafíos que propone; de las nuevas perspectivas legales y nuevas perspectivas laborales con el curso de 'Gestión de Calidad, de la Energía, los Riegos, y el Medio Ambiente' y una última 'enfocada a remover conciencias' finalizó el alcalde. El curso 'Derechos humanos y democracia' se desarrollará hasta el próximo miércoles 6 de julio y arrancó con 36 alumnos entre los que se encuentran alumnos de la Escuela Judicial. La primera ponencia corrió a cargo del director del curso, Juan Manuel Goig Martínez y se centró en mostrar el modelo de democracia que se establece en la Constitución del 78 y cómo ha ido cambiando con el paso del tiempo. El segundo turno fue para el profesor titular de Ciencia Política en la Universidad de Granada, Manuel Zafra Víctor que trató sobr

56 años en Trujillo al servicio de la fe Todo comenzó cuando por voluntad misericordiosa del Altísimo y la fuerza vivificante de su Espíritu, en Trujillo, el día 17 de junio de 1954, a invitación del devoto Eugenio Tejada Valladolid, se reunieron en la casa de Augusto Ascurra, un grupo de personas católicas creyentes en Jesús, con el objetivo de celebrar la Festividad del Señor de los Milagros. En marzo de 1957 nuevamente se reúnen los devotos en el Salón Parroquial de la Iglesia Santo Domingo, para organizarse como una Hermandad adscrita a dicho Templo, cambiando el nombre de Devotos del Señor de los Milagros por Hermandad del Señor de los Milagros-Trujillo; e instalado el día 6 de octubre del mismo año la primera Junta Directiva presidida por el Hermano Narciso Fernandini. Es así como nuestra Hermandad hace su fulgurante aparición al servicio de Cristo y la Iglesia Católica, con el principal objetivo de propagar el culto y veneración al Señor de los Milagros, cultivar en sus asociados la superación espiritual y moral cristiana, en bas

No importan las empresas que te contraten ni los uniformes que lleves, no importa tu currículum. No importan las personas con las que te has acostado y has dejado marchar. No importan los teléfonos móviles ni las redes sociales que falsean amistades creadas en un espacio cibernético. No importa el dinero que hayas gastado ni las mierdas que te hayas comprado. No importa que te creas independiente y autosuficiente. Acabar sólo es lo más horrible que le puede ocurrir a alguien. El peor de los castigos. Una vez sólo no recordarás los lugares donde no has viajado ni las cosas que no te has comprado. Tampoco recordarás las cosas que nunca has probado, eso ya no importará. Una vez sólo recordarás a aquél que te prometió quererte para siempre, a aquél a quién engañaste, a aquél al que no le ofreciste tu ayuda cuando sabías que la necesitaba, a aquél a quién no perdonaste, a aquél al que no conociste por miedo, recordarás a tus hijos y el poco tiempo que les has dedicado condenándote a un trabajo que creías la hostia por llevar un uniforme a juego con un maletín. Entonces desearás que todos ellos estén ahí. No quiero morir sola por haber cometido alguno de estos errores. Me aterroriza la idea de estar en una habitación blanca con poca ventilación y tener tantas horas para arrepentirme y sentir la frustración de no poder hacer nada para cambiarlo. Y aun así cometo mucho de estos errore

Conde pide a la oposición que decida pronto para no parar la ciudad El equipo de Gobierno da el borrador de presupuesto por cerrado y considera que no se entendería que no lo lleven al Pleno de diciembre pese a las conversaciones sobre una moción de censura La asamblea de Imagina Burgos aprobó el documento que servirá de base a las negociaciones con el PSOE.-ISRAEL L. MURILLO La portavoz del equipo de Gobierno y vicealcaldesa, Gema Conde, solicitaba ayer a los grupos políticos que están conversando sobre la presentación de una moción de censura contra el alcalde, Javier Lacalle, «que decidan lo que tengan que decidir, pero que lo decidan pronto». Con estas palabras, tras la Junta de Gobierno, Conde se refería a que el final de año es crucial para el Ayuntamiento, sobre todo cuando está tan avanzado el presupuesto para 2017 y ya se preveía, por parte del PP, llevarlo a un Pleno el 16 de diciembre. El equipo de Gobierno, en opinión de su portavoz, poco puede «hacer y decir» en estos momentos en relación con la moción de censura ya que son el resto de grupos políticos los que están tratando sobre ello. «Estamos a la espera de ver si esas conversaciones fructifican o no, pero no podemos decir nada porque desconocemos el contenido de la mismas», aseguró Gema Conde a quien se le pidió que explicara si se había tratado sobre esta cuestión durante la reunión de la Junta de Gobierno. La concejal se remitió a las declaraciones que durante estos días habían realizado tanto Javier Lacalle como el presidente del Partido Popular, César Rico, y explicó que el equipo de Gobierno sigue trabajando «por los burgaleses» y por terminar el borrador del presupuesto. «Seguimos igual que desde hace año y medio dejándonos las pestañas día a día con nuestros aciertos y nuestros errores y lo seguiremos haciendo hasta saber si los grupos de la oposición se inclinan hacia un lado o hacia el otro», dijo. Añadió que el Ayuntamiento no se para. En relación con las cuentas para el próximo ejercicio, considera que el borrador está cerrado, aunque ayer la concejal no adscrita Silvia Álvarez de Eulate presentó sus propuestas al concejal de Hacienda. Conde añadió que el mismo día que el portavoz del grupo municipal socialista, Daniel de la Rosa, anunció que paralizaban las conversaciones sobre el presupuesto con el PP para centrarse en la moción de censura, cosa que sucedió el pasado viernes 18 de noviembre, se habían incorporado el 100% de las exigencias que los socialistas habían planteado de cara a dar su apoyo directo o indirecto a las cuentas (buscando su abstención). De esta manera, la portavoz del equipo de Gobierno insinuó que no entendería un voto negativo de los socialistas en relación con el presupuesto si llega al Pleno del 16 de diciembre. Añadió, a este respecto, que esta es una pregunta que debería responder el grupo socialista en función de los próximos acontecimientos y rechazó hacer ejercicios de «política ficción». Concejal no adscrita Por su parte, la concejal no adscrita Silvia Álvarez de Eulate explicó ayer que aun considerando la moción de censura «un instrumento legítimo» achaca las conversaciones entre los grupos políticos a una «necedad política» y a una «conducta ir

Como se llega a esta conclusión? Apple usa un sistema o patrón para el número de núcleos que arranca en cero, por ejemplo para sus primeros dispositivos con un solo núcleo usan /cores/core.0. , para los procesadores de la actual generación (A5) que son duales usan /cores/core.1. , pues bien, lo que hallado es una referencia que dice: /cores/core.3 , si seguimos la misma lógica, se trata de [...] Publicado en iPad, iPhone/iPod, Rumores | Características del nuevo Motorola DEFY MINI XT320 un smartphone a prueba de todo enero 6th, 2012 No hay comentarios aun Junto al nuevo Motorola MOTOLUXE también ha sido anunciado el Motorola DEFY MINI, un smartphone para gente de aventura (o como yo, con manos de trapo), resistente al agua, al polvo y arena y con pantalla resistente a percances gracias a la ya bien conocida tecnología Gorilla Glass, el DEFY MINI viene con una pantalla táctil capacitiva de 3.2 pulgadas lo suficientemente buena como para redactar texto, navegar por internet y ver películas, su cámara de fotos no es tan espectacular como la del MOTOLUXE pero nos puede sacara de apuros con sus 3MP y flash, tambi

Hackear las imágenes de los mapas I - VHPlab Martes 13 de mayo de 2008, por Horacio González Diéguez. González Diéguez, Horacio. Hackear las imágenes de los mapas I [online]. Santiago de Compostela, España, VHPlab, mayo de 2008 [versión de diciembre de 2008] [Consultado el ]. Disponible en Internet: https://www.vhplab.net/spip.php?article18 Es posible cargar las imágenes de google directamente en una aplicación si se conoce su URL, para poder hacerlo solo es necesario saber como están codificadas dichas URL. En el caso de los mapas resulta bastante sencillo, la siguiente URL conduce a la imagen del mapa de santiago: http://mt3.google.com/mt?x=487&y=376&zoom=7 * Como se puede observar las variables x e y indican la posición en un array de imágenes que contiene todo el mapa del mundo. La variable indica el tamaño de ampliacion del mapa; cuanto menor sea zoom, que puede tomar valores entre o y 17, mayor será el tamaño del mapa y por lo tanto mayor el array de imágenes. Los siguientes enlaces corresponden a una serie de mapas que se hicieron con el fin de rastrear la posición de puntos e imágenes en los mapas, medida tanto en píxeles como en latitud y longitud. coordenadas-pixels-1.html coordenadas-pixels-2.html coordenadas-pixels-3.html coordenadas-pixels-4.html coordenadas-pixels-5.html coordenadas-pixels-6.html La forma de encontrar la url de una imagen concreta del mapa es sencilla, simplemente es necesario calcular las coordenadas en píxeles de la imagen, restarle el resto de su división entre 256 y dividir de nuevo entre 256. Todos los ejemplos se basan en algo tan sencillo como esta función: // calculamos las coordenadas en pixeles del punto central del mapa var offset = mapa.getCurrentMapType().getProjection().fromLatLngToPixel(center, zoom); /* para conocer las coordenadas de la imagen que le corresponde, calculamos el resto de su división entre 256 */ var restox = offset.x%256; var restoy = offset.y%256; /* al restar el resto y dividir entre 256 las coordenadas del centro obtendremos la posición x e y de la imagen del mapa */ var imgx = (offset.x - restox)/256; var imgy = (offset.y - restoy)/256; //si el mapa se encuentra en modo mapa político la url de la imagen será la siguuiente var url1 = "http://mt3.google.com/mt?n=404&x=" + imgx + "&y=" + imgy + "&zoom=" + (17 - zoom); //si el mapa se encuentra en mo

Los rumores apuntan a una serie centrada en Mos Eisley Publicado el 15 Septiembre 2019, 19:03 0 Desde hace ya varios meses, los fans de la película "Han Solo" han seguido una férrea campaña pidiendo a Disney una secuela. Y es que, aunque la primera entrega no resultó tan bien como se esperaba de un personaje tan carismático, tampoco se dio un excesivo desencanto. Y aunque la Casa del Ratón no tiene planes (al menos por ahora) de retomar la historia del contrabandista, sí que podría sacar un nuevo spin-off de la película. El rumor lo ha lanzado la web Star Wars Unity, de Jeremy Conrad. Aunque por el momento no hay nada oficial, Conrad es conocido por hacerse con la primicia de muchas series y películas tanto de Marvel como de la propia Star Wars. La serie no se centraría en los míticos personajes de Han Solo, Chewbacca o Lando, sino de algo relacionado con la ciudad de Mos Eisley. Un proyecto que, según el reporte, ya estaba en marcha desde el pasado año y que con la llegada de Disney+ hab

El agua - Trabajos de investigación - 512 Palabras Hasta 1990 Colombia ocupaba el cuarto lugar en el mundo después de la Unión Soviética, Canadá y Brasil en mayor volumen de agua por unidad de superficie. El rendimiento hídrico promedio del paíssegún los expertos, era de 60 litros por kilómetro cuadrado, lo que era seis veces mayor que el rendimiento promedio mundial y tres veces el de Suramérica. Siete años después el panorama es totalmentediferente según el último estudio del Departamento Nacional de Planeación, realizado en 1996, el cual indica que ahora Colombia ocupa el puesto 17 a nivel mundial en volumen de agua por unidad desuperficie.

Jaén subastará el tranvía tras fracasar la oferta de Ferrocarriles de Cataluña | Andalucía | EL PAÍS Jaén subastará el tranvía tras fracasar la oferta de Ferrocarriles de Cataluña El alcalde dice que entregará las llaves a Griñán si persiste el desinterés empresarial 28 ENE 2013 - 20:10 CET Ampliar foto Presentación del tranvía de Jaén en diciembre de 2010. josé manuel pedrosa Lo ha reconocido el alcalde, José Enrique Fernández de Moya: el de Jaén es "el tranvía a ninguna parte". Lo que era un secreto a voces no ha hecho más que confirmarse: el sistema tranviario jiennense, paralizado desde mayo de 2011 antes de su estreno, seguirá en punto muerto, y lo más probable es que lo haga de modo indefinido a pesar de haberse invertido en él más de 100 millones de euros. El Ayuntamiento jiennense sacará a concurso la explotación del tranvía después de fracasar la oferta planteada por Ferrocarriles de la Generalitat de Cataluña (FGC), que supeditaba su gestión a que hubiera ayuda municipal, algo que el alcalde ha rechazado de plano. Y si, como se teme, no hay ninguna otra empresa que opte a la licitación, el regidor de Jaén lo tiene claro: "Al día siguiente iré a San Telmo a entregarle las llaves del tranvía al presidente Griñán". El gobierno municipal, del PP, ha esperado a conocer la auditoria presentada por la empresa pública catalana para confirmar su nulo interés por reactivar el tranvía. Este sistema de transporte fue la bandera electoral de la anterior alcaldesa socialista, Carmen Peñalver. Fernández de Moya siempre ha renegado del tren ligero. Según el estudio económico de FGC, presentado ayer por el alcalde, el coste anual del tranvía s

Detienen a preso fugado que violó a tres niños y mató a uno de ellos | Noticias al instante desde LAVOZ.com.ar | La Voz Detienen a preso fugado que violó a tres niños y mató a uno de ellos 16 de julio de 2011, 18:54 • Sucesos > Abuso sexual FERNÁNDEZ. El abusador fue capturado (Foto: www.mdzol.com). Pedro Fernández (60) había sido condenado a prisión perpetua. Pero el domingo pasado, cuando, salió del penal, no regresó. Ahora lo apresaron. El preso que había fugado el domingo pasado de una cárcel de Mendoza donde cumplía una condena por violación de menores, a uno de los cuales había asesinado porque lo conocía, fue recapturado hoy, informaron fuentes judiciales. Se trata de Pedro Américo Fernández, de 60 años, quien en 1991 había intentado violar a dos chicos y había abusado sexualmente de otros tres, a uno de los cuales asesinó "porque lo conocía y podía denunciarlo", informaron voceros de la Justicia local. Fernández fue apresado ese año y, tras ser identificado por la víctimas, en las rondas de reconocimiento, fue condenado por la Justicia provincial a prisión perpetua. En 1999, en ocasión de las Fiestas de Fin de Año cuando se rebajan o conmutan penas, el gobierno provincial dispuso rebajarle la condena a 25 años de reclusión, por "buen comportamiento en la penitenciaria en los últimos ocho años" según aconsejaron jueces de ejecución penal de la época. Este año, cuando se cumplían dos décadas de la condena que termina en 2016, Fernández reclamó y obtuvo "por buena conducta" el beneficio de salidas por horas, durante los fines de semana, "para visitar un familiar", que otorgó otro juez de ejecución penal. Desde el domingo pasado, cuando salió del penal y no regresó, Fernández pasó a ser el hombre mas buscado de Mendoza y fue recapturado hoy tras el allanamiento de una vivienda de la ciudad de Rivadavia, al este de la capital provincial. En su histotial figura que el acusado "se hacía pasar como técnico de fútbol, que promocionaba a chicos para que jugaran en clubes de Junín, Rivadavia y San Martín". En 1991 se comprobó que Fernández había intentado violar a dos chicos de la zona y había abusado de otros tres, a uno de los cuales había asesinado porque "lo conocía y podía denunciarlo" según confesó después. Los padres del chico asesinado, Daniel Romero de 14 años, dijeron que Fernández se presentó y dijo que lo llevaría a probarse en un club de fútbol de la zona y días después, tras denunciar su desaparición, fue hallado sin vida en un campo sobre un colchón entre arbustos de la zona rural. Los examenes forenses determinaron que el chico falleció "ahorcado con un alambre en la garganta" y Fernández fue condenado a cadena perpetua. Ayer, cuando el violador estaba todavía fugado, Dante Gallardo (33) relató por radio "Nihuil" detalles de como huyó cuando tenía 11 años de Pedro Fernández. Gallardo dijo que estaba preocupado por sus hijos porque "este hombre no es un ser humano, es un animal y además cuando yo lo señalé en ronda de sospechosos ocho meses despues de capturado como quien intentó violarme me escupió y dijo que me mataría junto a toda mi familia". Luego reseñó que el 19 de enero de 1991, cuando se celebraba en Junín la Fiesta de la Vendimia, Fernández le preguntó si quería ganarse unos pesos vendiendo panchos a los concurrentes. El chico accedió y subió en un colectivo "hacia Palmira, adonde Fernández dijo que tenía una camioneta para traer el kiosco y los enseres para el pequeño negocio". Desde Palmira regresaron en la camioneta pero a mitad del camino y en una zona rural descampada el hombre detuvo el vehículo a un costado de c

AST-GOT Y ALT-GPT susana el Lun Ene 11, 2010 12:56 pm Quería haceros una consulta, a ver si me podeis ayudar. Tras varios intentos por ajustar la dosis de depakine a mi hijo, ya estamos a nivel, concretamente tiene 80,8 mg/L. En la última analítica (tras la subida de medicación) han salido unos niveles de ALT-GOT de 71 U/L (lo normal es menos de 40) y niveles de ALT-GPT de 42 U/L (lo normal es menos de 40). Tanto la neuro como el pediatra me han tranquilizado diciendo que no son "preocupantes", pero que hay que llevar un seguimiento exhaustivo de la función hepática. O sea, que repetimos análisis en 15 días. Mi duda es si esto es habitual cuando se sube una medicación y después se normaliza y en que influye el hecho de tener estos niveles altos. Los demás valores bioquímicos y hematológicos son normales. Re: Depakine y transaminasas Julio el Mar Ene 12, 2010 9:27 pm Sí, es normal. El Depakine es así. Suele hacer que suban las transaminasas (GOT y GGT). Significa que se está "forzando" el hígado. Es una medicación muy exigente para con el hígado. Aunque esos niveles, como bien te dicen, no son preocupantes. Sé de casos en los que las transaminasas se dispararon a 4.000... y a 8.000... Pero hay que hacerle un seguimiento al niño.

Llévelas nuevamente a la olla y añada la leche a los pocos mientras usted usa un tenedor para aplastar y mezclar las papas hasta que alcance la textura deseada. Le sugerimos 35 ml de leche entera, pero eso depende de lo cremoso que usted quiera que quede el puré, por eso, vaya agregando la leche lentamente. La mantequilla se incorporará después, por eso, solo ajuste la sal del puré y déjelo aparte mientras hacemos la carne.

Refinería y ciudad encienden motores al Plan de Modernización. – Noticias BVirtual Inicio Noticias Especiales Refinería y ciudad encienden motores al Plan de Modernización. Lo cierto es que hay una avalancha de proyectos y millonarias inversiones que cruzan por el puerto petrolero. Entre otros, la Hidroeléctrica del Río Sogamoso, proyecto estimado en $ 2 billones y cuyo embalse entrará en operación comercial a finales del 2014; la Ruta del Sol, una de las obras de infraestructura más importantes de Latinoamérica por su recorrido e impacto sobre los tiempos y costos de transporte y que, con una inversión de alrededor de $ 6 billones, une el centro del país con la Costa Atlántica, y la Gran Vía Yuma, con una inversión de $ 260 mil millones, que conectará el oriente con el occidente del país. La lista sigue: están el Proyecto de Plataforma Logística Multimodal, el Plan Maestro de Industria, el Plan Portuario para Barrancabermeja y lo que se ha denominado la Súper Vía, que es la conexión Barrancabermeja / Bucaramanga. A la par con el inicio de estos proyectos se encuentra el Plan de Modernización de la Refinería de Barrancabermeja. Esta ampliación aprobada por la Junta Directiva de Ecopetrol, permitirá que la refinería procese 180 mil barriles de crudo pesado cada día, aumente en 20 puntos su factor de conversión, produzca combustibles ambientalmente amigables y sea autosuficiente para producir la nafta que la mayor producción de crudo pesado del país está demandando. Cuando concluya el proyecto, la Refinería estará en capacidad de procesar crudos pesados, con altos contenidos de azufre, ácidos y otros componentes. Esto obliga a la adopción de tecnología de punta y procesos altamente especializados que garanticen su conversión en productos valiosos como la gasolina y cumpliendo los más exigentes estándares de calidad. La producción de crudos cada vez más pesados en Colombia está haciendo necesaria la modernización y ampliación de la infraestructura de refinación de Ecopetrol. La misma razón está presente en el Plan Maestro de la Refinería de Cartagena (Reficar S.A.), otra empresa del Grupo Empresarial Ecopetrol. «El proyecto de modernización de la refinería de Barrancabermeja es una oportunidad valiosa para que se dé un salto cuántico respecto a la forma como venimos haciendo las cosas. Cuando uno piensa en grande y busca metas grandes logra resultados distintos. Con este proyecto buscamos ir en grande, pero no solo nosotros, sino también con la región en la que estamos, con Barrancabermeja, con el Magdalena Medio y con nuestro país», aseguran directivos de Ecopetrol en el puerto petrolero. Actualmente, la Refinería de Barrancabermeja tiene un factor de conversión del 76%, lo que ubica a esta instalación industrial en una clasificación de conversión media y orientada a procesar principalmente crudos livianos. Con la modernización pasará a un esquema de conversión profunda o alta conversión, con un factor del 96%. Al mismo tiempo, el proyecto busca ampliar la capacidad de carga de crudos pesados y una producción de combustibles más limpios, de mejor calidad y mayor rentabilidad. 90 años en un parpadeo. El 18 de febrero de 1922 llegaron al caserío La Tora, hoy Barrancabermeja, los primeros equipos procedentes del Perú de la International Petroleum Company para procesar una carga de 1.500 barriles diarios. En sus inicios la Refinería de Barrancabermeja entregaba cuatro productos. La historia de la refinería se ha construido a la par con la historia de Barrancabermeja. Para ese entonces el pueblo tenía 404 viviendas y 3 mil habitantes. Su primer alcalde, Juan Bautista Reyes, fue nombrado mediante decreto del gobernador de Santander de la época, José María García Hernández. Nació el Instituto Santander, el primer colegio privado en este poblado a orillas del Magdalena Medio que empezaba a ganar reconocimiento nacional por el campo La Cira Infantas. Justamente para procesar el crudo de La Cira fue creada la refinería de Barrancabermeja. Desde que Ecopetrol la recibió, un poco después de la reversión de la Concesión De Mares, cuando había asegurado la capacidad técnica y humana para manejarla, ha invertido poco a poco en la consolidación de sus procesos, la modernización de sus instalaciones y el mejoramiento de las competencias de sus trabajadores. Para cuando llegó a manos de la empresa, la capacidad de procesamiento de la refinería había pasado de esos 1.500 iniciales a 22 mil barriles diarios. En 1953 entraron en funcionamiento la unidad de destilación, la unidad de cracking modelo IV y la primera viscorreductora, y comenzó la ampliación de Servicios Industriales. La capacidad de carga de la refinería fue creciendo y sus instalaciones también lo hicieron. En 1.967 se puso en operación la segunda unidad de destilación, cracking orthoflow, la unidad de destilación al vacio y la planta de lubricantes. En 1972 la carga superó los 100 mil barriles diarios y empezaron a funcionar las plantas petroquímicas: Aromáticos, Parafinas, Polietileno I y Alquilos. En 1980 inició operación la Unidad de Balance (Cracking UOP I, Demex, Unibón) y las plantas Etileno II y Polietileno II. En 1995 se inauguró la nueva Cracking UOP II y se logró la modernización de la planta U-200. En 2000, con la Planta de Alquilación, empezó a producir gasolina de alto octanaje. En 2010, con la Pla nt a de Hidrot rat a miento de Combustibles (HDT), entró a operar la nueva planta de tratamiento de gases residuales (Unidad de clauspol), que redujo significativamente las emisiones de dióxido de azufre (SO2) a la atmósfera en el puerto petrolero. Esta planta recupera los gases residuales y los convierte en azufre para luego comercializarlo en el país. Así se evita su quema en los incineradores y las teas, para que Barrancabermeja y el país respiren un aire mejor. 10 nuevas plantas serán construidas en terrenos aledaños a los de la actual refinería. Ahora la Refinería de Barrancabermeja se prepara para asumir otro gran reto: el Plan de Modernización. El precio del diesel y su consecuente mayor demanda en Colombia, el incremento en la producción de crudos pesados y la disminución de los livianos, junto a regulaciones ambientales cada vez más exigentes para los combustibles, hacen que la refinería se vea en la necesidad de adecuar su esquema de producción mediante la modernización de sus procesos e infraestructura. El diesel que se distribuya en todo el país deberá tener menos de 50 partículas por millón de azufre y la gasolina contará con menos de 300 partes por millón. Actualmente el combustible con esa calidad se entrega en Bogotá, Medellín a los sistemas de transporte masivo de Colombia. Asegurar a largo plazo ese suministro de mejores combustibles al país, sin necesidad de costosas importaciones, es uno de los objetivos del proyecto. La modernización asegurará también autosuficiencia de nafta, producto esencial para el transporte de los crudos pesados por oleoducto, y garantizará el abastecimiento de la demanda proyectada de combustibles en la zona de influencia de la refinería más allá del 2020 y, dada la envergadura de la inversión, jalonará el desarrollo de las empresas nacionales de servicios del sector que cumplan los estándares exigidos por Ecopetrol para convertirse en aliados estratégicos futuros de la refinería. El proyecto ya superó las fases de prefactibilidad técnico / económica y de ingeniería conceptual, selección de tecnologías, ingeniería básica y plan de ejecución. La Junta Directiva de Ecopetrol sancionó el proyecto y aprobó su ejecución. Luego viene la ingeniería de detalle, las compras, la construcción, el montaje y la puesta en marcha de las nuevas unidades. Con la modernización se logrará el aprovechamiento del 96% del crudo que llega a la refinería. Para ello se instalarán plantas como la Unidad de Coquización Retardada, que mediante un proceso de eliminación de contaminantes a lo largo del proceso hará posible obtener 60 mil barriles adicionales de combustibles, prioritariamente diesel y gasolina. O la Hidrocraking, una planta con capacidad de 200 millones de pies cúbicos de hidrogeno, que será la encargada de la eliminación del azufre. La Planta de Amina, la Planta de Hidrodesulfurización y la Planta Despojadora de Aguas Agrias, también harán parte de la nueva configuración estructura. El complejo industrial de Barrancabermeja al cuadrado. En total serán 10 unidades nuevas, 6 tanques de almacenamiento de materia prima, una nueva subestación eléctrica interna con capacidad de 120 megavatios, el reemplazo y modificación o reubicación de 17 tanques existentes, nuevos sistemas de teas, enfriamiento de agua y almacenamiento de coque (el carbón térmico y el metalúrgico que quedan tras la refinación completa del crudo), entre otros. Pero lo anterior no es tan sencillo si descomponemos esos totales en sus actividades principales: habrá que mover 6 millones de metros cúbicos de tierra e instalar 1.508 equipos, algunos de los cuales tendrán más de 1.200 toneladas de peso. Serán necesarios 183 mil metros cúbicos de concreto, 23 mil pilotes, 37 mil toneladas de tubería, 28 mil toneladas de estructuras metálicas, 320 mil metros cuadrados de pintura y por lo menos 25 millones de horas / hombre para los trabajos de ingeniería y construcción. El Plan de Modernización consiste en sumar todo un complejo industrial al actual complejo industrial que es la Refinería de Barrancabermeja. A ese grupo de plantas siempre creciente y en mejora, que incluso en alguna de las estructuras anteriores de Ecopetrol en 60 años de historia se llamó precisamente así: el distrito Complejo Industrial de Barrancabermeja (CIB). Poner en marcha este proyecto requiere, además de disponer y poner en funcionamiento todas esas plantas antes mencionadas también interconectarlas adecuadamente con la refinería actual. En manos de Ecopetrol, la refinería no ha dejado de transformarse. La última planta instalada, la de hidrotratamiento, estuvo lista en diciembre de 2.010. Con la modernización, la Refinería de Barrancabermeja entraría al grupo de las mejores de Latinoamérica por la utilización de tecnología de punta, una operación confiable, segura y eficiente y, principalmente, por operar con un mínimo impacto ambiental. Sus instalaciones quedarán en capacidad de procesar más de 180 mil barriles diarios de crudos pesados, proveer hasta 50 mil barriles diarios de nafta (el diluyente requerido para el transporte de crudos pesados) y garantizar el abastecimiento de la demanda proyectada de combustibles en la zona de influencia de la refinería más allá del 2020. ¿Cómo se puede vincular Barrancabermeja con la Modernización de la Refinería? «El proyecto tiene claro que se requieren equipos, máquinas, tubos, pero principalmente gente comprometida con el mismo, talento humano, porque para nosotros la gente es lo fundamental para hacer realidad este sueño», dicen directivos de Ecopetrol comprometidos con la mega obra. En promedio está previsto que durante el pico más alto de construcción, el proyecto cuente con aproximadamente 4.000 trabajadores. Estas ocupaciones serán de carácter temporal y responderán a necesidades puntuales de la construcción. Un porcentaje de la mano de obra lo aportarán la región y el país, y otra parte será provista por otros países. Este último será personal especializado en la implementación de las tecnologías de última generación que se incorporarán al proyecto. Justamente por eso, Ecopetrol realizó un aporte de $1.000 millones al convenio denominado «Alianza para la Formación del Talento Humano», cuyo propósito es preparar integralmente y certificar competencias técnicas en las diversas especialidades tanto de la industria petrolera como de otras industrias, fortaleciendo el proyecto de vida, el núcleo familiar y el entorno del beneficiario para su crecimiento humano. «La Alianza con el SENA, la Alcaldía de Barrancabermeja y las Unidades Tecnológicas de Santander permitirá articular y aprovechar las especialidades de las instituciones educativas existentes en la región para lograr la transferencia de tecnologías y conocimiento del talento humano requerido por el sector industrial y empresarial. Pero sin duda lo más importante de esta iniciativa es que se estarán formando seres humanos integrales con valores, ética y responsabilidad social, será talento humano de clase mundial», dice Orlando Díaz, gerente general de la Refinería de Barrancabermeja. Barrancabermeja será una refinería de conversión y el proyecto con conciencia ciudadana. Para Ecopetrol la labor de fortalecer y formalizar la capacidad de los barranqueños para el trabajo se une un esfuerzo de reflexión colectiva sobre el futuro de Barrancabermeja como ciudad. Así las cosas, y con el acompañamiento de casi 40 instituciones gubernamentales y no gubernamentales del puerto petrolero, se viene realizando un ejercicio de construcción colectiva que se ha denominado: «El Gran Acuerdo Social Barrancabermeja Ciudad / Región 100 años». En el marco de los principios de compromiso, inclusión, transparencia y responsabilidad, esta iniciativa, liderada por la Diócesis de Barrancabermeja, el Programa de Desarrollo y Paz del Magdalena Medio, la Gobernación de Santander, la Alcaldía de Barrancabermeja y Ecopetrol, plantea el abordaje de 6 ejes temáticos: — Desarrollo del talento humano. — Fortalecimiento institucional. — Fortalecimiento económico. — Infraestructura para la sostenibilidad. — Cultura ciudadana. — Familias como eje de desarrollo. «La propuesta del Gran Acuerdo Social es una iniciativa para pensar la ciudad de manera conjunta, con los mismos intereses y canalizar las inversiones con el fin de crear condiciones de convivencia y desarrollo», dice el Programa de Desarrollo y Paz del Magdalena Medio. Para el PDPMM, «la modernización de la refinería es un proyecto que genera muchas oportunidades, porque en la medida en que sepamos aprovechar la llegada de esos recursos podemos generar no solamente la modernización, sino el desarrollo integral del territorio. Será una experiencia magnifica para mostrarle al mundo que invertir en un territorio vale la pena, porque produce cambios en sus pobladores y cambios muy positivos para el mundo social». Por su parte, directivos de Ecopetrol, comprometidos con la obra expresan: «Este gran proyecto no es solo un proyecto de empresa, es un proyecto región, es un proyecto país. Los beneficios esperados en lo económico, ambiental y social serán de am

MITO DEFINICIÓN: es un relato tradicional de acontecimientos prodigiosos, protagonizados por seres sobrenaturales o extraordinarios, tales como dioses, semidioses, héroes o mosntruos. 3. TIPOS DE MITOS Mitos cosmogónicos : intentan explicar la creación del mundo. Son los más universalmente extendidos y de los que existe mayor cantidad. A menudo, se sitúa el origen de la tierra en un océano primigenio. A veces, una raza de gigantes, como los titanes, desempeña una función determinante en esta creación; en este caso, tales gigantes, que suelen ser semidioses, constituyen la primera población de la tierra. 4. Mitos teogónicos : relatan el origen de los dioses Por ejemplo, Atenea surge armada de la cabeza de Zeus. 5. Mitos antropogónicos : narran la aparición del ser humano, quien puede ser creado a partir de cualquier materia, viva (un árbol, un animal) o inerte (polvo, lodo, arcilla, etc.). Los dioses le enseñan a vivir sobre la tierra. Normalmente están vinculados a los mitos cosmogónicos. 6. Mitos etiológicos : explican el origen de los seres, las cosas, las técnicas y las instituciones. 7. Mitos morales : explican la existencia del bien y del mal. 8. Mitos fundacionales : cuentan cómo se fundaron las ciudades por voluntad de dioses. Un ejemplo es el de la fundación de Roma por los dos gemelos, Rómulo y Remo, que fueron amamantados por una loba. 9. Mitos escatológicos : anuncian el futuro, el fin del mundo. Siguen teniendo amplia audiencia. Estos mitos compren

"Sintonía de amor" cumple 25 años | Sector Cine "Sintonía de amor" cumple 25 años Por: shuidobro Foto: Tristar Pictures 26. Jun. 2018 Si viviste los noventa y no amas ni odias a Meg Ryan, no estuviste ahí. "Sintonía de amor", un clásico de las dates en esa década, está cumpliendo 25 años. Aunque usted… no lo crea. Un día en el futuro alguien verá hacia atrás y pensará en los años noventa como ese tiempo en el que Kurt Cobain estaba vivo y la gente joven sabía quién era Meg Ryan. Aunque la generación millennial pueda tener apenas un recuerdo vago de la posterior y más bobalicona Tienes un e-mail (1998), la misma Nora Ephron, quien para entonces ya estaba convertida en la Woody Allen de los cursis, escribió cinco años antes otro guion que ya había reunido los suspiros sentimentales de Tom Hanks y Meg Ryan, cuya película reventó las taquillas recaudando algo así como el 1,100% de su presupuesto original. En las bodas de plata de Sintonía de amor (Sleepless In Seattle, 1993), te presentamos cinco datos que ni te imaginabas: 1.- El estelar era de Julia Roberts A pesar de que Nora Ephron y Meg Ryan ya se habían anotado un home run conjunto con Cuando Harry conoció a Sally (1989), el guion original fue ofrecido por la cineasta a Tom Hanks y a Julia Roberts, seguramente animada por el éxito de Mujer bonita (1990) y la posición de Roberts como novia de América (perdón, Lucerito). De hecho, tanto Hanks como Roberts declinaron, lo que llevó a Ephron a reescribir el libreto ayudada por su hermana. Hanks leyó la segunda versión y terminó por aceptar, aunque con nueva compañera: Ryan. 2.- Jason Schwartzman… ¿hijo de Tom Hanks? Para el papel del carismático y recién huérfano Jonah, el hijo pequeño de Tom Hanks en la cinta, los dos candidatos finales eran R

Dubái tendrá una flota de taxis drones en julio - America Noticias Volar en un taxi-dron será una realidad en esa ciudad de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos. ¡Qué envidia! Volar en un taxi será una realidad en Dubái No, no se trata del carro volador de Harry Potter. Dubái contará con taxis drones voladores que transportarán a personas a partir de julio próximo, así lo anunció el fabricante chino de drones EHang, encargado de suministrar este tipo de transporte a la capital de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos. El objetivo de Dubái es que el 25% del transporte sea sin conductor en el 2030. Asimismo, agilizar los desplazamientos y terminar con la contaminación. (Video tomado de PlayGround) En caso de problemas técnicos en vuelo, los vehículos están programados para posarse en la zona segura más cercana, y la comunicación entre las máquinas y el centro de control está encriptado, según la compañía. Dubái, la mayor ciudad de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos, quiere convertirse en una ciudad "inteligente" con un importante nivel de automatización d

ORRORESMEDICOS: PRESERVAR LA MEMORIA Una casa de Sant Sadurni esconde el legado de 300 años de una estirpe médica El último miembro dedicado a la profesión lucha en solitario para preservar ese tesoro Ramon Viader Guixà conserva en su casa de Sant Sadurní d'Anoia el legado de sus antepasados médicos y farmacéuticos. La casa del farmacéutico jubilado Ramon Viader Guixà, en Sant Sadurní d'Anoia, esconde un tesoro médico. Se trata de más de mil piezas –frascos, fármacos, máquinas, libros…– que testimonian los tres siglos a lo largo de los cuales las 10 generaciones anteriores a la de Viader Guixà se dedicaron a la medicina y la farmacia. El último de la estirpe trabaja a toda velocidad y con dinero exclusivamente de su bolsillo para preservar el legado. Su último esfuerzo es el libro 'Viader. Nissaga de metges i apotecaris' (Rubes Editorial, 2017). "No tengo nadie atrás: tengo un hijo ingeniero agrónomo y otro piloto de aviones", se sincera Viader Guixà. Esas piezas forman parte de su vida. "Mis padres las tenían en casa. Yo nací prácticamente en la farmacia, que era parte de la vivienda. Cuando se vendió, me quedé yo con todo", afirma. Una de las piezas más valiosas es un frasco florentino, un concentrador de esencias de vidrio, de principios del siglo XVIII. "El vidrio es raro, porque se rompe mucho", explica Viader Guixà. La colección contiene también un estuche de bolsillo de 1840, con una veintena de fármacos homeopáticos. Otra pieza curiosa es un pote de aspirina en polvo de 1898: por aquel entonces, Bayer aún no dominaba la técnica del comprimido. La biblioteca Viader guarda joyas como una impresión de 1663 de un libro del médico griego 'Dioscórides' y una copia de la primera farmacopea oficial en España, la Valentina. Un posible museo de la salud en L'Hospitalet aspira a hacerse con parte de la colección La colección Viader se expuso en el 2015 en en la Facultat de Farmàcia de la Universitat de Barcelona y ahora se prepara una vitrina definitiva en su sede. "Recientemente, he tenido contactos con el Ayuntamiento de L'Hospitalet, que quiere tirar adelante el Museu de Cièncias de la Salut de Catalunya, con la aspiración de que sea un referente en Europa", afirma Viader Guixà. L'Hospitalet aspira también a hospedar un instituto de medicina tradicional China. "Desconozco el proyecto del museo. Me parece muy bien, pero no se pueden hacer cosas ignorando lo que se lleva luchando desde hace años desde institucione

Los vecinos del ático. Before & After de un proyecto lleno de inspiración – El ático de Daniela – Estudio Es increíble como, a veces, sin pretenderlo, sirves de inspiración a otros para realizar un cambio de vida y lograr la casa de sus sueños. Esto es lo que les sucedió a unos buenos amigos, que conocieron nuestro ático hace un año y medio, en una fiesta de inauguración en la que quisimos compartir nuestra emoción de estrenar doble ático, nuestro piso y el ático de Daniela. A medida que les enseñábamos los distintos rincones, veíamos un brillo en sus ojos. Esa noche, salieron del ático con la semillita que les haría plantearse el gran cambio. Tras meses dando pasos con la propiedad de nuestro edificio, eligiendo el piso adecuado y celebrando que comenzaban este nuevo proyecto, me dieron la gran alegría de saber que querían que me ocupara de todo el proyecto integral! 185 m2 de maravilloso piso en ruinas! Nos inspiramos en líneas limpias y marcadas, que acentuaban el luminoso blanco de las paredes para conseguir un Minimalismo Chic, presente en toda la decoración. Las maravillosas piezas y accesorios de House Doctor nos ayudaron a potenciar, sin duda, la personalidad de la estructura de la casa, con ese toque de sobriedad y contundencia que les caracteriza.

Escríbemos a través de este formulario y Jordi te responderá en menos de 48 horas. LO QUE DICEN NUESTRAS ALUMNAS Después de haber hecho el curso me encuentro con más conocimientos para entender a los perros y me siento mucho más segura a la hora de plantear mi trabajo con los perros de mis clientes. Ana Belén Buerba, educadora canina Volver a casa, poner en práctica lo aprendido en el seminario y que el primer encuentro de mi perra Murphy con otros perretes haya sido sin incidentes me da muchos ánimos para todos los paseos que nos quedan. Muchas gracias de nuevo a los que habéis hecho posible este curso. Pablo, alumno Seminario Hemos llegado a tener una idea real y ordenada de cómo se relacionan los perros entre ellos y con nosotros. Nos ha permitido romper con aquellas antiguas creencias sobre la educación canina y nos ha permitido integrar en nuestra forma de trabajar su filosofía, confiando más en la propia naturaleza del animal sin anteponer nuestras necesidades a las suyas, en definitiva dejando que sean perros. Ana Gómez e Ingrid Vallverdú, educadoras caninas El curso me ha ayudado a comprender mejor a mis perros, entender su psique y sus necesidades, mejorar la calidad de nuestra comunicación y, desde ahí, mejorar nuestro vínculo, su calidad de vida y la mía. Y ahora, con todo lo aprendido, empezar a ayudar a otros humanos y sus perros en su camino de transformación. Besma Ruiz, educadora canina Mi experiencia del seminario El Paseo con Albert ha sido genial. Fue muy intenso, divertido y enriquecedor. Albert transmite con gran entusiasmo su conocimiento y experiencias, consiguiendo que los alumnos saquemos el máximo partido en tan poco tiempo y que nos quedemos con ganas de más. En definitiva, muy contento y dispuesto a seguir aprendiendo de los mejores. Luis Mallén, alumno Seminario Me ha cambiado totalmente la forma de entender cómo los perros se relacionan con el entorno, entre sí y con nosotros. Y de este modo, la forma en que podemos relacionarnos con ellos. El nivel de empatía que tengo ahora hacia ellos no lo había tenido nunca. También me ha ayudado a ver el mundo en general de un modo “más perruno”. Antonio Álvarez De Villena, educador canino Antes, sólo con el conductismo, me encontraba encorsetado, con soluciones no del todo satisfactorias. Ahora he aprendido a confiar en los perros. Se ha abierto un nuevo camino ante mí, con soluciones más flexibles. He dado un paso más en la educación canina. Eduard Ortega, propietario Conocer a Nico fue el impulso que me llevó a querer dedicarme a esto. Desde el principio sent

"Sí funcionan las Yalitzas", dice Delegado de AMLO en Veracruz; a Cuarón lo cuidó una, añade (video) | Zona Franca Manuel Huerta Ladrón Guevara, Delegado del Gobierno Federal en Veracruz, defendió la nueva forma de operación del programa de estancias infantiles durante la actual administración, en la que se establece que ahora serán los mismos padres de familia quienes recibirán de manera directa los apoyos para el cuidado de los menores, con el objetivo de que seleccionen entre una estancia infantil u otra persona. Como ejemplo para la segunda opción, recordó que el cineasta mexicano Alfonso Cuarón fue cuidado por "una muchacha" en su infancia, acontecimiento que se vio reflejado en Roma, película recientemente galardonada con tres estatuillas en la entrega de los premios Óscar, celebrada el pasado 24 de febrero en el Teatro Dolby de Los Ángeles.

Prosetecnisa Zuazo, último viaje antes del parón – Costa del Sol Málaga Prosetecnisa Zuazo, último viaje antes del parón 2014-2015, Balonmano Zuazo Doble enfrentamiento con equipos vascos, eso es lo que le queda al equipo de Diego Carrasco antes de llegar al parón liguero. El primero llegará este sábado en Barakaldo a las 19:00 horas, el Clínicas Rincón Málaga Costa del Sol visitará el Municipal de Lasaserre con la intención de ser el primer equipo que vence a domicilio en esta pista. El conjunto vizcaíno marcha quinto clasificado con 10 puntos en la zona alta de la tabla, 5 victorias y 3 derrotas son su marca (invicto en casa). El encuentro no será sencillo, pero ya en A Guarda el equipo se mostró competitivo en A Sangriña, para posteriormente, en el siguiente viaje a León, conseguir una victoria de importancia vital. Es por eso que el equipo viaja a Barakaldo consciente de la dificultad pero sabedor de que si se compite, se pueden tener opciones. Diego Carrasco contará para la ocasión con el equipo al completo, con la única baja de Bea Puertas que sigue con su proceso de recuperación. El partido podrá seguirse de forma íntegra en Metroradio en el 91.2 FM para Málaga. Apenas 3 días después del enfrentamiento con el Prosetecnisa Zuazo, las guerreras malagueñas reciben en casa al actual campeón, el Bera Bera de San Sebastian, en jornada entre semana adelantada, la última antes del pa

EL CABALLO SE CONVIERTE EN UNA HERRAMIENTA TERAPÉUTICA PARA PROMOVER LA REHABILITACIÓN DE PERSONAS CON DISCAPACIDAD FÍSICA Y SENSORIAL, FELIX PANDO PIENSA EN COLORES Y MÚSICA PENSADA EN LOS CABALLOS Actualidad Por: Guillermo Sammartino 24 de noviembre de 2022 En ocasiones, los seres humanos mantienen con los animales una relación personal muy estrecha que les llega a cambiar la vida por completo. Este vínculo tan personal que se establece, incluso les mejora la salud. Por todo ello, los animales se vienen utilizando en terapias asistidas desde el siglo XIX. Y los caballos no son una excepción. Fue un neurólogo francés quien, en 1875, descubrió los beneficios que los equinos podían proporcionar a sus pacientes. Nació así en Europa la equinoterapia, una disciplina empleada por profesionales de la salud física o mental, con el objetivo de promover la rehabilitación de niños, adolescentes y adultos a nivel neuromuscular, psicológico, cognitivo y social, por medio del caballo como herramienta terapéutica. La medicina ha demostrado que la terapia con caballos favorece la calidad de vida de muchas personas. FELIX PANDO y la MUSICOTERAPIA La música es una experiencia sensorial que puede activar todas las áreas cerebrales simultáneamente. Por tanto, es útil en terapia porque dispara el funcionamiento del cerebro en el sentido emocional, cognitivo y físico. Con las nuevas investigaciones que surgen sobre la Musicoterapia, se ha demostrado que es útil tanto en rehabilitación, educación y en programas para la mejora del bienestar. Este tipo de terapia es efectiva para tratar ciertos trastornos o mejorar la calidad de vida del paciente, y actúa de dos maneras: activa (tocar instrumentos, cantar, interpretar la música) y receptiva (usar la música para inducir estados de relajación). También se utilizan otras técnicas y formas artísticas de forma simultánea a la música, como el arte dramático, la danza o la pintura. Entre las novedades de la músicoterapia, y sus efectos en personas (niños, adultos, mayores, patologías diversas, grupos sociales; pero esta semana, a colación de una noticia que se publicaba sobre un proyecto pionero de cría en cautividad de San Martiños en el Acuario de La Coruña, hemos pensado …. ¡hablemos de musicoterapia para animales!

Realizan misa por el 177 aniversario Armada de República Dominicana — El Faro De Puerto Plata : El Faro De Puerto Plata Realizan misa por el 177 aniversario Armada de República Dominicana | 2:59 PM - jueves 15 de abril del año 2021 | Categoria: Policiales PUERTO PLATA.- Con motivo del 177 aniversario de fundación de la Armada de República Dominicana (ARD), fue realizada una Misa de Acción de Gracias en la catedral San Felipe Apóstol. La eucaristía fue oficiada por el obispo de la diócesis de Puerto Plata, Monseñor Julio César Corniel Amaro, quien destacó la encomiable labor que realizan los miembros de esa institución naval en defensa de nuestra soberanía y la protección del litoral costero del país. Las palabras centralesestudieron a cargo del capitán de Navío, Víctor Santos Gil, comandante de Puerto aquí quien explicó que la Marina de Guerra ahora Armada Dominicana, surgió en el fragor de las acciones independentistas contra los haitianos. Citó que en la célebre batalla naval de Tortuguero que tuvo lugar el 15 de abril de 1844 en las costas de Azua, allí nació la Armada Dominica con la hazaña patriótica del almirante Juan Bautista Cambiaso, el capitán Juan Bautista Maggiolo y del teniente Juan Alejandro Acosta, quienes derrotaron a una fuerza invasora de 3 buques de la Armada Haitiana. En la ceremonia religiosa estuvieron presentes el director regional Norte de la Policía Nacional, general de brigada, Jacinto Minaya Herrera, el Procurador Fiscal Titular de esta provincia, magistrado Osvaldo Bonilla y el Director General de la Corporación de Acueductos y Alcantarillados de Puerto Plata (CORAAPPLATA), ingeniero Oliver N

CUESTIÓN DE FORMA Y FONDO: PEQUEÑOS PERO NO INVISIBLES Y CARRETERAS SECUNDARIAS | El Blog de Enrique 'Fenrisolo' Cardoso ← HOMO HOMINI LUPUS: MIS EXPERIENCIAS EN UN COLEGIO MAYOR DE MADRID CREMATORIO, DE RAFAEL CHIRBES: APLASTAR O DEJARSE APLASTAR POR EL SISTEMA → La parrilla televisiva sufre desde hace años una saturación de programas baratos. Es comprensible. Hoy la televisión compite directamente con Internet, mientras las audiencias están cada vez más fragmentadas desde la irrupción de la TDT y de nuevos canales autonómicos. Hoy en día el éxito no depende tanto de tener mucha audiencia como de reducir costes. La nueva máxima es gastar poco, lo que ha llevado a, entre otras cosas, la degradación de los servicios informativos, la desaparición de buena parte del contenido para niños, la invasión de los programas sensacionalistas y la aparición de nuevos formatos. Muchas de estas nuevas formas de hacer televisión se engloban bajo el nombre de Docus y se centran en temas sociales. Yo evito a toda costa catalogarlos bajo un nuevo término que no es sino una reducción de otro mucho más enjundioso: Documentales. Los documentales de naturaleza de La 2, los de la II Guerra Mundial del Canal de Historia… todos esos programas de impecable factura e innegable valor divulgativo. Los Docus que hoy nos quieren endilgar sobre chonis de extrarradio y pisos en alquiler están en las antípodas del cine documental, y por tanto no se merecen compartir ni cuatro letras con ese noble género, el bueno de toda la vida. Dentro de los mal llamados Docus surgieron hace años unos programas que llamaré Cámara al Hombro, un formato de fácil producción, consistente en enseñar las cosas de un vistazo, casi con los ojos de un espontáneo que visita un lugar, conoce a sus gentes y se mete hasta en la cocina. Un espontáneo que no quiere ir más allá, que se queda en la anécdota graciosa e impactante. Empezaron con Callejeros, mostrándonos los rincones más marginales y más lujosos de España con un ratio de 9:1 respectivamente, esto es, nueve barrios asquerosos por uno exclusivo a más no poder. Un televidente distraído podría pensar que vivimos en Guinea Ecuatorial, donde la clase media es una entelequia. Cuando los intrépidos reporteros del programa se percataron de que ya no quedaba más mierda española por mostrar a sus productores se les encendió la bombilla y decidieron copiar el formato de '(Gentilicio en plural) por el mundo' para pasar a mostrarnos la mierda del resto del planeta. Todo intercalado, otra vez, con lo más alto de la sociedad, a lo que supuestamente debemos aspirar el ejército de mataos' hartos de ver anuncios de Rolex en las revistas. Callejeros Viajeros es un programa dinámico, en el que ni siquiera se pierde el tiempo en presentar a los emigrantes españoles que hacen la vez de guías turísticos (sospecho que de esta forma pretenden evitar una denuncia por plagio de formato, o es que directamente son así de lanzados). Está lleno de escenas cortas, cortísimas, y músicas estridentes entre frase y frase. Planos imposibles, mucho follón en las calles, la ciudad en llamas. Callejeros Viajeros es, en suma, un videoclip de reggaetón. Mal apañado, pero videoclip al fin y al cabo. Cuánto daño ha hecho Callejeros a la televisión en España. A raíz de este programa de la Cuatro el resto de cadenas irrumpieron con espacios similares. Algunos, como Cámara Abierta de TVE, se centran en aspectos sociales de actualidad y no tanta actualidad. Otros siguen la senda de Expañoles por el Mundo y compañía pero dentro de nuestras fronteras. Pienso en Carreteras Secundarias, de La Sexta, en el que uno de esos reporteros intrépidos visita un pueblo de nuestra geografía y enseña lo más variopinto del mismo. El formato se parece bastante al de Callejeros Viajeros: una sucesión de imágenes y sonidos revueltos. Dos protagonistas: el oriundo del lugar que enseña el bar de turno -o lo que sea- y el omnipresente reportero, quien a pesar de estar casi siempre detrás de la cámara se encarga de mantener un vínculo constante con los anfitriones. Un vínculo de condescendencia y valiente ignorancia. Carreteras Secundarias es un programa hecho por urbanitas sin poka idea del mundo rural y, peor aún, sin poko interés en el susodicho. Un tío que desde la ciudad llega a un pueblo y se apaña un reportaje sin más armas que su verborrea de baratillo y su sexto sentido para encontrar lo anecdótico, enmarcarlo y ponerle precio. La música que acompaña todo el minutado no podía ser más inapropiada. A-ha, Cindy Lauper y cualquier artista de radiofórmula ochentera. Da igual que en pantalla aparezcan unos abuelos jugando a la petanca, que por los altavoces va a sonar la selección más alegre de Kiss FM. Ya el título da una pista: Carreteras Secundarias, la música que amenizaba nuestros largos viajes por la piel de toro, las carreteras que, como una tela de araña, conectaban esos rincones de cachondeo y feliz subdesarrollo del territorio nacional con la gran ciudad, única luz entre tanta oscuridad. Y muchos pensarán; qué más da cómo se llame el programa, la música que empleen, o cómo monten las imágenes. Es un programa dinámico en el que con mucho salero muestran los pueblos más bon

Diálogo UPR | UPR Bayamón adquiere poderoso "drone" para adiestrar a la Policía 9 de julio de 2021 Por DiálogoNoticias Con el propósito de adiestrar a Policía de Puerto Rico y personal de otras agencias del gobierno, la División de Educación Continua y Estudios Profesionales (DECEP-UPRB) de la Universidad de Puerto Rico de Bayamón (UPR-Bayamón) adquirió dos naves aéreas no tripuladas el "DJI Matrice 300 RTK V2 Combo" y DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise (Dual)". La adquisición de estos innovadores equipos se realizó con fondos provenientes del Programa de Capacitación de Servidores Públicos, establecido mediante alianza entre la Oficina de Administración y Transformación de los Recursos Humanos (OATRH) y el Sistema UPR, informó el rector, Dr. Miguel Vélez Rubio. "La División de Educación Continua y Estudios Profesionales (DECEP) de la UPR-Bayamón hace historia una vez más con la adquisición de esta herramienta que impactará positivamente la seguridad y optimización de servicios de diversos sectores -entre ellos el apoyo avanzado a operaciones de seguridad policiaca y el apoyo a la agricultura- en Puerto Rico. Nos enorgullece contribuir al desarrollo de soluciones innovadoras como estas para responder a las necesidades de la ciudadanía en nuestra Isla. Agradecemos al Dr. Carlos Rosado y al equipo de la DECEP-UPRB por su continua aportación al ofrecimiento de una educación superior de excelencia, utilizando estrategias y enfoques innovadores, dirigidos y adaptados a la sociedad cambiante de la actualidad", expresó el rector. "El DJI Matrice 300 RTK V2 Combo es posiblemente el único equipo con estas características que existe actualmente en Puerto Rico. Tiene una autonomía de vuelo de 55 minutos y puede volar a 50 millas por hora. La nave está equipada con una cámara de tres lentes, súper poderosa y capaz de capturar detalles importantes. Es a prueba de choques porque cuenta con un sistema sofisticado de sensores que le permiten a la nave detectar peligros y salvar obstáculos. Así como otras muchas características avanzadas y muy útiles. Invitamos a las agencias del gobierno y otras entidades interesadas en capacitar a su personal en el manejo de naves no tripuladas a comunicarse con nosotros", explicó el Dr. Carlos F. Rosado, director de la DECEP-UPRB. Por su parte, Luis Fernando Rivera Alameda, presidente de Puerto Rico Drone Academy expresó que, "gracias al apoyo de la DECEP de la Universidad de Puerto Rico de Bayamón esta tecnología ya está en Puerto Rico. Hay que reconocer que los drones son de gran utilidad para la seguridad pública, privada o para manejo de emergencias, ya que les permitirá actuar de forma más ágil, eficaz y segura. Estos equipos pueden ser los ojos de cualquier vigilante de seguridad en remoto que necesite revisar grandes extensiones de terreno, acudir a un incidente, hacer un seguimiento o hacer cualquier tipo de verificación a distancia". Con la adquisición de este equipo se ofrecerán otros servicios de apoyo para las agencias del gobierno que pudieran beneficiarse con el uso de estos equipos

Dr. Michael Newton: "El Viaje de las Almas" y la "Vida entre Vidas" - Página 2 Dr. Michael Newton: "El Viaje de las Almas" y la "Vida entre Vidas" Tema: Re: Dr. Michael Newton: "El Viaje de las Almas" y la "Vida entre Vidas" Vie 21 Dic 2018, 14:39 Para ponerle un marco historico a la reencarnacion quiero agregar que es un concepto hinduista por el lado del budismo niega la Reencarnacion y lo que hay es Renacimiento no hay un Yo permanente o alma que pasa de un cuerpo a otro sino energia de impulsos de la anterior vida; la verdad que no lo entiendo bien el concepto budista pero niega la reencarnacion y lo explica con el renacimiento. Sobre la clonacion puedo pensar que un ser clonado es como que no es de nadie y ahi me va la frase de que es un desalmado, creo que Parra dice que es un desdichado vivo-muerto porque carecera de alma. Pero porque sera negado ese cuerpo en el mundo espiritual? pienso en algunas razones...como que no expresa originalidad no es unico e irrepetible entonces ese ser en el mundo espiritual no seria unico y eso no es posible, no es posible copiar a Dios!.

La amenaza, según Efe, llega después de que ayer se hiciera público que varios miembros de dicha gestora, nombrada tras la destitución de Tomás Gómez, están llamando a los diferentes líderes locales del PSOE para pedirles que en las asambleas que van a celebrarse –desde hoy hasta el viernes– muestren su apoyo a Ángel Gabilondo La gestora liderada por Simancas ha tomado directamente las riendas de la agr

Circular No. 010 | Territorial Territorial > Circulares > Circular No. 010 Como es de su conocimiento, el Plan de Intervenciones Colectivas –PIC, definido por la Resolución 0518 de 2015, obliga a la Dirección de Salud de Caldas (DTSC) y a las Alcaldías municipales, destinar un porcentaje de acuerdo a la categoría determinada en el artículo 20 de la misma Resolución, de la fuente de financiación del Sistema General de Participaciones. En el caso del Departamento, la destinación para PIC es del 30% y 50% para las ESEs Municipales y Departamentales del territorio, el resto del porcentaje es para la ejecución de actividades de Gestión de Salud Pública. Con lo antes mencionado, la Dirección Territorial de Salud de Caldas, inicia el proceso precontractual para PIC teniendo en cuenta las dimensiones del Plan Decenal de Salud Pública prioritarias por cada Municipio, de acuerdo con esto, cada ESE debe cumplir con los siguientes criterios: Garantizar la disponibilidad o vinculación de la totalidad del talento humano exigido por la entidad territorial por el tiempo acordado y según lo previsto (Art. 11 – Resolución 518). Manejar los recursos destinados para el PIC en una cuenta bancaria exclusiva hasta la firma de liquidación del convenio o contrato, los recursos allí depositados sólo podrán ser utilizados para el pago de los bienes o servicios que se requieran para la ejecución de las intervenciones contratadas (Art. 11 – Resolución 518). En caso de que el banco que no certifique la cuenta exclusiva para PIC, se debe sustentar con un certificado por el Gerente de la ESE. La ESE debe tener dos años de experiencia relacionada con la ejecución de las acciones que se pretendan contratar. Disponer de un coordinador para la ejecución de las acciones del PIC que se pretenda contratar, respecto del cual se debe acreditar que cuenta con el perfil establecido por la DTSC. Este coordinador debe tener un año de experiencia relacionada, además, al momento de entregar la documentación para el contrato, deberá adjuntar la hoja de vida de la función pública con sus respectivos anexos.

El furor por los Mercados gourmet Imitando el modelo de otros grandes mercados gourmet del mundo, también en Buenos Aires han abierto algunos y van por más. Después del Mercat Villa Crespo y el Mercado de los Carruajes, ahora abrirán Mercat Caballito, a metros de Acoyte y Rivadavia. El Mercado de los Carruajes funciona en Leandro N. Alem 452, ocupa el edificio de la antigua cochera de los carruajes presidenciales, refuncionalizada para albergar esta propuesta de Mercado Gourmet, puestos de comidas, venta de alimentos, locales comerciales y terraza para eventos. Mercat Villa Crespo, situado en Thames 547, fue inaugurado en marzo de 2021. Ocupa un edificio donde antiguamente funcionaba una fábrica de carteras. Es un mercado donde conviven propuestas gourmet, productos naturales, degustaciones, charlas, eventos y entretenimiento. Este nuevo emprendimiento, Mercat Caballito, estará a una cuadra de Acoyte y Rivadavia, en el nuevo segundo piso del Shopping Caballito y tendrá algunas diferencias con respecto a los otros dos mercados gourmet inaugurados en marzo de 2021. Ofrecerá dos propuestas comerciales diferentes: Por un lado, bares, restaurantes, barras y cafeterías cuyos platos se podrán consumir in situ y por delivery o take away. El mercado tendrá una superficie total de 1.200 m2 y contará con un espacio de 270 metros de góndolas bajas, de productos orgánicos, que terminarán en una línea de cajas y además tendrá 250 lugares para sentarse. Esta segunda planta se sumó al shopping tras la incorporación de un edificio sobre la calle Rosario que se unió a un depósito. El Mercat será una importante propuesta culinaria del centro comercial, que solo contaba con un McDonald's. Se estima que será inaugurado en diciembre próximo y entre los locales que tendrán allí su espacio podemos citar: Kyopo, un restaurante de comida coreana; Pizzería Nuvola; Avocado Republic y otros, aún no confirmados. También se repiten algunos emprendimientos que están en el Mercat Villa Crespo como el restaurante y charcutería Lado A, la panadería judía Moisha Bakery y La casa de Tafí, especializado en empanadas. Entre las novedades, habrá una arrocería especializada en risottos. Además habrá una barra de tragos y vinos y una cafetería y pastelería, aún sin definir. El mercado orgánico estará a cargo de Argentbio Market, un

El tribunal, encabezado por Lorenzetti, recibió el reclamo de 34 senadores En un fuerte gesto de diálogo institucional, que contrasta con la postura que el Gobierno mantiene con el Congreso, tres jueces de la Corte Suprema de Justicia recibieron ayer a 26 senadores nacionales de la oposición, que pidieron participar en las causas que varias provincias mantienen contra la Nación por la distribución de fondos de la coparticipación federal. Atento a la trascendencia del hecho y a no prejuzgar, lo que le podría valer una recusación, Lorenzetti destacó que ésta era "la primera vez en toda la historia que la Corte recibe a un grupo tan importante de senadores", lo cual aclaró "causa cierta conmoción". El presidentedel máximo tribunal de justicia de la Nación, agregó: "Esta es una reunión institucional, protocolar y muy positiva. Es un diálogo entre poderes que nunca se hizo". La cara de los legisladores comenzó a reflejar de inmediato alegría y sorpresa por lo que escuchaban de la máxima autoridad de uno de los tres poderes de

Gordó advierte de que sin acuerdo con Rajoy no habrá consulta 15 de abril de 2013 (12:27 CET) Con más detalle o menos, con interpretaciones distintas, en el seno del Govern comienza a ofrecerse un mensaje claro, el de aceptar las dificultades de convocar una consulta soberanista en 2014. Si el President Artur Mas aseguró, hace una semana, que el referéndum podría demorarse hasta el final de la legislatura, este lunes ha sido el conseller de Justícia, Germà Gordó, quien ha reclamado una cierta calma en el proceso. Gordó, en el Fórum Nueva Economía, con la presencia del mundo judicial y de dirigentes del Govern, ha afirmado que no ve posible la consulta sin un acuerdo con el Gobierno central. "Sólo se podrá hacer si llegamos a un acuerdo con el Gobierno, y ahora lo veo difícil, aunque nosotros tenemos un compromiso en el Parlament para convocar la consulta". En un tono moderado, buscando el consenso, Gordó ha insistido en que el proceso necesita una cierta calma, y, en una alusión a Esquerra Republicana –en el acto estaba el diputado de ERC, responsable del área económica, Pere Aragonés-- se ha referido al acuerdo de gobernabilidad con los respublicanos. Según Gordó, el acuerdo mantiene que, preferiblemente, la consulta se deberá celebrar en 2014, pero, en función de las circunstancias que se presenten, se podría convocar a lo largo de la legislatura. "No tenemos que ir todos acelerados ni nerviosos", ha pedido el conseller de Justicia. Gordó ha considerado que buscar "un punto de encuentro" con el Gobierno es la única opción, porque da por seguro que, en caso contrario, el Ejecutivo español acudirá al Tribunal Constitucional para que anule la ley de consultas catalana que permita el referéndum. Caspe o Pau Claris En una conferencia, en la que ha repasado las actuaciones del departamento, ha insistido en la necesidad de dialogar con Madrid. A

Mueven a Morelia por la Paz con certificación de instructores de Feeling dance – La Pagina Noticias Mueven a Morelia por la Paz con certificación de instructores de Feeling dance Morelia, Michoacán.- El alcalde de Morelia, Wilfrido Lázaro Medina, encabezó la mañana de este sábado, el arranque de la segunda etapa de certificación para instructores de Feeling Dance en el municipio, reconocimiento que durante su primera fase obtuvieron 70 entrenadores que a través del baile movieron por la paz a ciudadanos de 36 colonias. "En la vida todos somos maestros y todos somos alumnos al mismo tiempo; tenemos algo que dar y mucho que recibir con humildad. Ustedes están dando muestra de que nos educamos juntos y trabajamos en solidaridad", afirmó el edil moreliano luego de hacer la entrega simbólica de certificados en la plaza Melchor Ocampo de la capital michoacana. Ante decenas de mujeres y hombres que acudieron al Centro Histórico para participar también en una mega clase de Feeling Dance, Lázaro Medina expresó: "Yo los convoco para que, orgullosos de ser morelianos, mantengamos esta actitud de tender la mano, de ayudarnos entre nosotros. Que si alguien tiene una necesidad, entre todos los vecinos vayamos y apoyemos" Feeling Dance fue creada por José Navarro Magallanes y forma parte del programa federal Redes de Organización Vecinal que opera la Dirección de Enlace Ciudadano del Ayuntamiento de Morelia para mover al municipio por la paz, a cargo de Ana Lorena Pérez Cárdenas, quien explicó que actualmente se cuenta con 12 promotores capacitadores, con el objetivo de reconstruir el tejido social a través del aprovechamiento de los espacios públicos. Rodrigo Maldonado López, secretario de Política Social del Gobierno de Michoacán, en representación del gobernador Salvador Jara Guerrero, manifestó: "La Suma de Voluntades, señor Presidente Municipal, hoy más que nunca está más que demostrada, porque los morelianos queremos estar bien. Gracias por estar tan al pendiente" Finalmente, el representante del Secretario Ejecutivo del Consejo de Seguridad Pública, Óscar Luis Argüelles Méndez, explicó que próximamente se aplicarán 36 millones 946 mil en el municipio en a

'Generación 2018', entre explorar lo distinto y redisponer lo existente La Casa Encencida en Madrid expone la 18 edición de Generaciones, dedicada a artistas emergentes 10/02/2018 - 20:32h La casa Encendida. Generación 2018. Generaciones en La Casa Encendida y Circuitos en la Sala de Arte Joven de la comunidad de Madrid son citas importantes. No hay más echar una ojeada a su historia (esta es la decimoctava edición de Generaciones y será la vigesimonovena de Circuitos) para darse cuenta de que por ambas y muchas veces en ambas, han pasado bastantes de los artistas que hoy están en cualquier conversación. Sin embargo, en los últimos años es posible detectar cierto escepticismo en la crítica. Repasando lo escrito sobre ediciones anteriores se desprende un cierto sentimiento de déjà vu , de que esto en realidad no avanza. En realidad, cabría preguntarse y de hecho se ha preguntado cien mil veces, si no estamos ante la muerte de la pintura y la escultura. Suena un poco como la canción de R.E.M. It's the end of the world (as we know it). R.E.M. añadían And I feel fine. Una de las piezas que se muestran en esta Generación introduce muy bien el tema. Umbral, de Serafín Álvarez (1985) viene a ser un pequeño grotto, típicos en los jardines pudientes desde el Renacimiento y en muchos jardines públicos de finales del XIX y principios del XX. Dentro de la pequeña gruta y sin lugar para sentarse hay un monitor y una fuente de sonido. Lo que se muestra igual sorprende a algunos visitantes del arte, pero resultará de lo más familiar para millones y millones de adicionados a los videojuegos. Se trata de lo que en los juegos suele llamarse un paisaje abierto por el que el jugador puede deambular con plena libertad recorriendo entornos generados digitalmente. En la isla hay cuevas, desiertos o junglas y todo tipo de objetos que se refieren a hitos de la ciencia ficción como 2001, Dune o El Planeta Salvaje. Umbral es un juego que recuerda a algunos como Dear Esther (2012) en el cual la acción es mínima: reconstruir una historia a través de las cartas dejadas en una isla desierta en las Hébridas por Esther. El juego recibió muchísimos premios y suscitó la discusión en torno a si en realidad era un videojuego o una obra literaria. Que también habría respondido a una forma distinta de entender la literatura. Umbral está aquí como obra de arte, como todo lo que entra en un museo (Duchamp dixit). Pero en realidad tiene más sentido frente al propio ordenador o televisor asumiendo el control que en LCE se ha cedido a un algoritmo. En todo caso se plantea una pregunta: ¿cuantas personas que hace solo unos años se habrían dedicado a pintar habrán dirigido su actividad a estos terrenos? Hacia unos videojuegos que ahora llegan a plantear cuestiones morales bastante duras o a desmontar jugando las teorías libertariano-capitalistas de una Ayn Rand. Serafín Álvarez. Umbral, 2018. La Casa Encendida. Generación 2018 El resto de Generación 2018 parece arte tal y como lo hemos conocido en los últimos tiempos y que también va perfilándose. Se trata de algo que bien podría llamarse freeform, como algunas corrientes en la música y que suele incorporar elementos que antes solían presentarse aislados. Casi todo en Generación 2018 respondería a esa idea. José Díaz (1981) explora las posibilidades de una pintura en cuya presentación aparece la palabra informalista (término europeo surgido en la segunda mitad del siglo XX para reunir todo tipo de prácticas poco o nada realistas). Pero José Díaz, como otros pintores y pintoras de hoy, no se conforma con su propia subjetividad concibe la pintura como un elemento casi constructivo o más bien planimétrico relacionado con situaciones genéricas, en esta pieza la M-30 de Madrid, una vivencia muy común. Lo de Antonio Gagliano (1982), Sistema Nacional de innovación, es interesante porque se basa en algo muy industrial, muy de la época en que surgió la actual idea de la pintura y del aura de obra única: las imágenes presentadas junto a las patentes. Algunas son antiguas como una chistera que se transforma en bombín de 1878 o una de 1925 sobre obtención de dibujos animados por transparencia (fundamental en el desarrollo del género). Otras son más contemporáneas como un panel solar hecho de vacío de 2013. Está bien, con un punto retro en que ideas muy locas se unen a piezas que realmente significaron un progreso técnico. Irene Grau (1986) viaja bastante y desde hace un tiempo lo hace con un pequeño cuadro blanco que cuelga en alguna pared de la habitación, ya sea hotel, apartamento, o casa privada, donde resida. Lo que vemos son fotografías frontales del cuadro en los diferentes entornos. Este traslado de lo poco significativo pero propio a lugares ajenos y poco notables en sí mismos puede funcionar y resultar sugerente. Quizá en el sentido de una de las frases de apertura de la película Sans Soleil (1983) de Chris Marker sobre una serie de cartas de Sandor Krasna: "He dado la vuelta al mundo varias veces y ya solo lo banal me interesa". Lo de Antoni Hervás (1981) parece relacionado con el informalismo mencionado en José Díaz, plásticos trasparentes de colores vivos y ninguna forma reconocible. Esto tiene relación con la mitología como proxy de una reflexión sobre el FistfuckingManifesto (1985) de Robert Prager, cuyo nombre ya era algo indicativo. Podría estar bien pero el problema es que nada de eso se deduce de la misma pieza. Parecen los restos de una decoración de club y parecen reclamar más estroboscopios, luce UV y música potente más que una sala museística. Lo cual hace regresar al primer punto, aquello de los paradigmas del arte. Lola Lasurt (1983) realiza una exploración en España negra (1899), un libro de viajes del pintor y dibujante español Dario de Regoyos (1857 - 1913) y el escritor belga Émile Varhaeren (1855 - 1916). El viaje resultó ser un recorrido por lo más truculento de una España que ya era de por sí muy bestia. Lasurt pinta y realiza cortos y aquí los combina con efectos de reflejos en una sala oscura. Da que pensar y funciona. Por su parte Elena Lavellés trata en Dark Matter el tema de la moneda, del patrón oro adoptado en la conferencia de Breton Woods en 1944 que significo en principio la adopción del patrón oro como respaldo de las monedas nacionales, pero en realidad significo el ascenso del dólar USA como divisa de referencia y el establecimiento de un nuevo orden económico mundial. Lavellés pone esto de manifiesto mediante muestras de minerales, una escultura realizada con periódicos que asemeja las capas de una mina abierta y un mapa sobre la explotación del subsuelo de México y la correspondiente destrucción de entornos naturales. Por su parte Fran Meana (1982) muestra en Startercultures: Hongos, alquimia y su territorio, un título que ya dice bastante y se concreta en la sin duda muy aleccionadora fabricación de quesos. La cosa tiene más sentido de lo que parece a primera vista y trata de la producción inmaterial, la biopolítica y otros conceptos elevados pero más en concreto con la posibilidad de que esos productores, las bacterias, se declaren en huelga por una serie de circunstancias que se explican en un vídeo.

Las mejores jugadas de la madrugada NBA vienen cargadas de un recurso cada vez más usado en el baloncesto moderno. El bloqueo directo. Los 'highlights' de la jornada vienen marcados por las continuaciones de los pívots tras jugar un dos para dos. El más beneficiado de ello, DeAndre Jordan. El pívot de Los Ángeles Clippers se benefició de las asistencias del siempre solidario Chris Paul para aparecer por partida doble en el Top10. Los angelinos vencieron de forma clara en Washington. Fue una noche donde predominó el mate. No hubo tapones espectaculares, pero sí que hubo un triple determinante. Lo anotó el recuperado Kyrie Irving para la agóni

pt archivos - Centros Educativos Vicencianos de las Hijas de la Caridad España Sur - Mevisur Durante este curso, en nuestra Aula de Apoyo a la Integración, nos hemos propuesto dar protagonismo al movimiento y volver a los orígenes del aprendizaje. Dada la importancia del desarrollo evolutivo de los bebés en la inteligencia y en el progreso académico, quizás haya que analizar qué aprendizajes quedaron sin asentar en nuestra primera infancia y qué reflejos primitivos pudieran haber quedado sin integrar. Nuestros objetivos fundamentales son ejercitar la lateralidad, la coordinación, el equilibrio e integrar los reflejos a través de una Terapia de Movimientos Rítmicos: BRMT. Porque las dificultades en las habilidades académicas (lectura, escritura, cálculo, plástica, memorización…) están relacionadas con:​ La no-integración de los reflejos primitivos.​ Trabajar las diferentes etapas del desarrollo comprobando que cada etapa ha sido superada y se han ido logrando los prerrequisitos para un buen aprendizaje académico. Las dificultades en visión y audición.​ La mayor parte de la información que se recibe a nivel académico entra por el canal visual. He aquí la importancia de revisar si existen dificultades no sólo en la vista del alumno/a sino también en su visión. Del mi

Después de una larga siesta, donde costaba distinguir un vino de otro, una nueva generación de Chardonnay chilenos despierta nuestro entusiasmo, profundizando en la cepa y en las particularidades de sus distintos terruños. El presente de la cepa es promisorio, pero lo mejor aún está por venir. Estuvo descuidado. Perdido. Travestido. El Chardonnay, una de las cuatro cepajes fundamentales de la vitivinicultura posmoderna, no encontraba su justo medio. Jugaba en los extremos, con un ritmo cansino, predecible, empujado por las modas imperantes, sin desarrollar una personalidad propia ni menos profundizar en sus distintos orígenes. Cuando se plantó en Casablanca, a principios de la década del 80, pensábamos que su fortuna cambiaría. Incluso, intuíamos, que sería la principal cepa del primer valle costero de Chile y la bandera de los blancos chilenos. Sin embargo, se cometieron muchos errores. Algunos de ellos por omisión, pero otros derechamente fueron un impúdico atentado contra su naturaleza. Alentados por el estilo californiano que dominó a partir de la década del 90, vinos gorditos y dulzones, maquillados con una madera con desvaríos hollywoodenses, los Chardonnay chilenos se convirtieron en un commodity, en una pachanga tropical, en un homenaje a la vainillina, en unos fisiculturistas con músculos decorativos, incapaces de correr 50 metros planos sin presentar síntomas de ahogo. La receta se fotocopiaba y pasaba de mano en mano en las bodegas. Cosechar bien entrado el otoño, fermentaciones reductivas en estanques y luego un upper cut de barrica nueva que nos dejaba en la lona. Otro problema fue el material vegetativo. Como el Chardonnay estaba de moda, se propagaron indiscriminadamente las plantas que estaban más a la mano. Se trataba del tristemente célebre clon Mendoza, una selección masal que atravesó la cordillera sin dar nunca pruebas de blancura. Con aromas demasiado estridentes, y una mezquina acidez, no era el clon para estrenar la nueva generación de Chardonnay chilenos. Hoy se pagan los platos rotos. Muchas de aquellas plantaciones, luego de superar la adolescencia, muestran signos de una vejez prematura, obligando a los viticultores a labores de replantes y a un desesperado juego de ensayo y error con la importación de nuevos clones franceses. El Chardonnay ya no goza de la incontrarrestable popularidad de antaño -el Sauvignon Blanc lo ha eclipsado incluso en Casablanca-, pero este cepaje vuelve a resurgir con mucha fuerza en los últimos diez o quizás cinco años. La introducción de plantas clonales y patrones, que se han adaptado a las distintas condiciones de suelo y tolerantes a plagas como los nemátodos, sumado a la búsqueda de nuevos conceptos enológicos, han provocado un vuelco cualitativo que se deja sentir en nariz, pero sobre todo en boca. Aunque aún no logra su consolidación definitiva, y aún encontramos una masa uniforme que baila al ritmo de las cambiantes preferencias de los mercados, cada vez son más los enólogos que han decidido tomarse el Chardonnay en serio, buscando su propio camino, su propia identidad. La vuelta de los fudres y tinajas, de fermentaciones más lentas y oxidativas, y en general el objetivo enológico de construir bocas más firmes y profundas, no sólo permiten alcanzar nuevos umbrales de calidad, sino vinos que pueden crecer con el tiempo, alcanzando otros sabores, otros matices, otras complejidades. El descubrimiento y consolidación de nuevas zonas vitícolas, como los valles de Limarí, en el norte, y Malleco, en el sur, también han abierto el abanico de posibilidades para esta cepa que hoy se reinventa para mostrar la mejor de sus caras. El respeto al tiempo durante el proceso, la pérdida del miedo al oxígeno, el uso más razonable de la madera, y un genuina búsqueda por resaltar las particularidades únicas de los distintos orígenes, han dado vida a una nueva camada de Chardonnay que despierta entusiasmo y, en ciertos casos, incluso logra emocionar. Es el vino que más me gusta de esta joven bodega del Limarí. Es el más radical y jugado de la dupla conformada por Felipe Müller y Héctor Rojas. Intenso y fresco, como pocos, quizás como ninguno. Cítrico y con un retrogusto salino que hace salivar, invitándonos a beber una nueva, una nueva, una nueva copa. Proveniente de la zona de Fray Jorge, a sólo 12 kilómetros del océano, este vino es hijo de la tiza, la camanchaca y el viento. A 19 kilómetros del mar, al norte del río Limarí, Quebrada Seca se ha convertido en un barrio de lujo para los Chardonnay chilenos. Y De Martino y su enólogo Marcelo Retamal han sabido resaltar las características de este paisaje desértico, donde las parras son manchones verdes en un suelo de tonos anaranjados y blancos. En un año de mucha concentración, este vino muestra su lado más potente y mineral. Es el vino que lidera el portafolio de Maycas. Y con todos los merecimientos. Es un Chardonnay intenso y concentrado. Mientras su nariz es elegante, llena de sutilezas, su boca muestra todo su poder y profundidad de sabores. Sin duda el enólogo Marcelo Papa ha consolidado su relación amorosa con el valle y la cepa. Es un vino bien trabajado, que abre el apetito, que invita a esperar… a disfrutar de su gran potencial de guarda. Proveniente del viñedo Las Petras, a sól

Todos habremos visto a estas alturas, las fotos de Batman vs Bane en medio de lo que parece ser una pelea entre polis y matones. Pero la sorpresa viene con la foto que enlazo más abajo, ya que Marion Cotillard encarna a Miranda Tate, una miembro de Wayne Enterprises que ayudará a Bruce Wayne con los proyectos filantrópicos de su padre (según wikipedia). Desde cuando una ejecutiva se ve envuelta en una batalla entre policias y matones??? No será que la sorpresa es que ella terminará siendo SPOILER Despues de mucho tiempo sin entrar por aqui por varios motivos, hoy traigo novedades (que seguro que todos ya sabreis). Un saludo!!

Brendon Todd lidera en Cromwell, Dustin Johnson acecha | Asociación de Voluntarios de Golf - AVG Entre las sombras del recorrido de Cromwell ha surgido un competidor que llevaba algún tiempo peleado con sus palos. Como quien espera su momento, Dustin Johnson, descerrajó ayer un 61 para reivindicar su golf. Mackenzie Hughes inició las hostilidades con un 60 en la jornada de inicio del Travelers Championship. Luego Phil Mickelson hizo un deslumbrante 63 el viernes, para adquirir una ventaja de un golpe antes del fin de semana. Nadie hablaba de Dustin Johnson después de dos jornadas con 69-64 situado en el vigésimo puesto de la competición a seis golpes de Mickelson. Tras fallar el corte en el Charles Schwab Challenge, terminó décimo séptimo la semana pasada en el RBC Heritage. Estaba precalentando. Ayer el que fuera número uno del mundo y ganador del US Open de 2016 se dio un festín de juego. Alcanzó 12 de las 14 calles y 16 de los 18 greens en regulación. Hizo nueve birdies y ningún bogey. La vuelta más baja de su carrera, 61 golpes. «Siempre podría haber sido mejor», dijo Johnson después con una sonrisa. «Pero, hice un montón de buenos putts que entraron en el hoyo desde ese rango de entre dos y tres metros, probablemente emboqué cuatro, cinco o seis de ellos. Sí, hice algunos buenos putts. Estoy muy contento con la forma en que jugué». El 61 dejó a Johnson con 16 bajo par, a dos golpes del líder del torneo, Brendon Todd. Después de entregar dos tarjetas de 66-65, Todd también aprovechó las condiciones ideales, y un gran momento de putt, para también terminar una tercera ronda libre de bogeys, 9 bajo par, 61 golpes, que pudieron ser menos, si llega a embocar un putt asequible en el último de su vuelta. Empezará el domingo en 18 bajo par. Todd, de 34 años, natural de Pittsburgh, Pensilvania, puede presumir de dos victorias esta temporada ganó el Bermuda Championship junto al Mayakoba Golf Classic. No tiene el poder de estrella de Johnson o la fuerza desde el tee de salida, pero el antiguo alumno de la Universidad de Georgia está teniendo un año de ensueño. «Parece que desde el otoño, cada vez que tengo una bucle de dos o t

La cartera se mantiene estable - ELESPECTADOR.COM La cartera se mantiene estable 19 Oct 2013 - 10:43 AM Según el último reporte de Estabilidad Financiera, el panorama de las actividades de los establecimientos de crédito es positivo. Luego de la desaceleración que se venía presentando desde finales de 2011, la cartera volvió a recuperar su ritmo y los resultados son consecuentes con la estable evolución que han mostrado los indicadores de calidad y de mora con respecto al año pasado. Según el más reciente reporte de Estabilidad Financiera del Banco de la República, "la cartera bruta creció a una tasa real anual de 13,3% en junio del año en curso, cifra superior a la observada en diciembre de 2012 (12,5%)". El documento reveló además que los empresarios del sector corporativo privado poco están pidiendo préstamos y que el mayor desempeño está en los altos niveles de endeudamiento y en la carga financiera de los hogares. De acuerdo con el Emisor, las distintas clases de entidades presentan un moderado crecimiento en las pérdidas potenciales por riesgo de mercado. Este comportamiento se explica por el alto uso de créditos de consumo distintos de las tarjetas de créd

¿Qué es la realidad? : Offtopic general Asunto: ¿Qué es la realidad? Publicado: 06 Feb 2018, 17:28 Hola, me he encontrado este cortometraje. Si os apetece miradlo, creo que puede sorprender. Asunto: Re: ¿Qué es la realidad? Publicado: 06 Feb 2018, 17:56 1er postulado: la realidad es un constructo social 2do: la realidad es un delirio colectivo Publicado: 06 Feb 2018, 23:57 Publicado: 07 Feb 2018, 00:40 Publicado: 07 Feb 2018, 04:35 Publicado: 07 Feb 2018, 08:01 Va de menos a más, llegando a mucho, y termina en menos. El intro es un bodrio y el ending también (deberían aprender del anime), pero en general está bastante bueno. Y menos mal que decidí verlo en vez de guiarme por los comentarios porque no comentan ni la mitad de todo lo que se dice. Pero yo también paso de hacerlo, sólo digo que una de las cosas más básicas de la filosofía es la refutación de... lo que tenía entendido se llamaba"esceptisismo radical" o absoluto, pero bueno, parece que no es es eso, sino esto: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias#T ... tiese,_sería_incognoscible Y del subjetivismo radical/absoluto. Tú sólo dices que puede sorprender, no opinas sobre si las afirmaciones del profe son ciertas o falsas. Ni siquiera una. Normal porque eres el OP, pero bue. Sócrates opina que está muy bueno, pero supongo que se refiere al video no a que las ideas del profe en él sean ciertas. Edu pone una imagen con la cual quizá cree que refuta las ideas que pone socrates pero se equivoca, ya que la idea de rojo podría ser un constructo social también. Se podría invertir el ejemplo, aunque no sé bien cómo... A un extraterrestre le enseñan qué es el rojo para nosotros, y en una ocasión cruza la calle con el semáforo con luz infraroja, pero nosotros la vemos roja. Un astronauta desmayado y su nave caen cerca de una tribu perdida. Los tribuales (wft), conocidos por el astronauta, lo llevan con su jefe, momento en el cual ya ha despertado. - ¡Esperad, no soy vuestro enemigo! - Es lo que vamos a averiguar. ¡Tiradlo en el pozo de cocodrilos! - Si sobrevive, es un peligro para nuestro Dios Coco, y sino, le ayudará. El astronauta usa sus propulsores para volar fuera del pozo. - ¡Es un peligro! ¡matadle! - El que grita "¡

Habían estado con Jesús todo el día escuchándolo enseñar a multitudes. Se hacía de noche y el Señor les dijo: “Crucemos al otro lado del lago” (Mrc. 4, v. 35). Disfrutaban de una tranquila y silenciosa navegación. Jesús agarró una almohada y se fue a dormir en la punta de la barca. De repente una gran tormenta se desató en el medio del mar. Había otras barcas cerca. Los vientos eran tan fuertes y las olas tan altas que creyeron hundirse. Los discípulos despertaron a Jesús con un grito desesperado: “¡Maestro! ¿No te importa que nos ahoguemos?” (v. 38). ¿Te has sentido así alguna vez? ¿Experimentaste en tu corazón tal turbulencia que creíste que te ahogabas? Podemos atravesar tormentas intensas o pequeños chaparrones, el tamaño del problema depende de nuestra perspectiva. El caso es que, a menudo, al igual que los discípulos necesitamos desesperadamente de la paz que sólo Dios nos puede dar. Isaías profetiza sobre el niño que vendría, el Hijo de Dios, y lo llama “Príncipe de Paz”. Príncipe, según el diccionario, es el “hijo del rey que es heredero de la corona”. El príncipe dispone de los bienes del padre. Jesús, nuestro Príncipe de paz dijo en Juan 14:27 (NTV) “Les dejo un regalo: paz en la mente y en el corazón. Y la paz que yo doy es un regalo que el mundo no puede dar. Así que no se angustien ni tengan miedo.” Los discípulos estaban al lado del dador de la paz pero sus corazones estaban repletos de miedo. Fue entonces que Jesús le habló al viento y a las olas: “¡Silencio! ¡Cálmense!” (v. 39). Inmediatamente la naturaleza obedeció y hubo completa paz. Jesús nos ofrece la paz de Dios, esa que sobrepasa todo entendimiento. Pero es cuestión de fe. El Señor les dijo a sus amigos: “¿Por qué tienen miedo? ¿Todavía no tienen fe?”. Isaías 26:3 y Fil. 4:6-7 nos anima a ir al Señor y permanecer en él, y como resultado su paz guardará nuestra mente y corazón. Algunos sinónimos de » guardar» son: defender, cuidar, custodiar, vigilar, velar, atender, esconder, asegurar, conservar. Eso puede hacer la paz de Dios en nuestra mente y corazón si tan sólo creemos y descansamos en el Príncipe de paz. ¡Qué, como el viento y las olas al escuchar a Jesús, tu corazón reciba su paz!

Sí, es cierto, aún siendo un pequeño ya tenía noción de las cosas con el Monterrey de Mohamed y compañía, así como también de Antonio De Nigris, del cual quiero hablar hoy, pero no fue hasta con la imagen de un delantero corriendo hacia la tribuna con su mano estirando la camiseta y gritando efusivamente "gol" cuando el amor por el fútbol lo encontré en su máxi

Trabajadores incansables del cuarteto, los chicos de La Banda de Carlitos aseguran que la siguen remando como al principio, cumpliendo el sueño acunado en los días de los comienzos. En ese camino, llevan ya seis discos (todos en vivo), el último de los cuales fue lanzado en enero bajo el título “La LBC te pone loco”. El disco tendrá su presentación hoy en en la Sala del Rey. Dialogamos con Rubén “Quesito” Pavón, cantante y flamante dueño del boliche Locura, un after de boulevard Las Heras 34. Porque intenté grabar en estudio y es como que no me incentiva. Sale muy feo, sinceramente. Hemos grabado tres o cuatro temas para probar y no sirve. Mucho laburo. Es por eso que decidimos grabar tres compactos por año. Como tenemos cuatro bailes por semana y casi siempre va la misma gente, escuchar dos meses los mismos temas cansa un poco. Si vos te prestás al juego, puede ser que sí; pero si vos no te prestás…. yo nunca me presté al juego para nada y siempre la he peleado solo. Laburo con Marcos Farías y mi hermano, y entre los tres nos fijamos en nuestro negocio. El cuarteto es competitivo, todos competimos pero mientras vos hagas la tuya, no creo que sea tan “competitivo”. Si vos jugás limpio, te van a jugar limpio y si jugás sucio, te van a jugar sucio. Me parece que los dos últimos discos han sido muy buenos. Muy buenos como para ponerlos en la radio. Hemos venido laburando de a poquito, hemos tenidos discos lindos, buenos, bastantes buenos y así. Empezamos en Guiñazú. Haciendo el recorrido barrial. Te enumero las pistas: Pista cara e´perro, La meta vivir, Los chicos del ciclón, El Fachi, La costa canal 15, La escuelita Mi Taller. Hacíamos bailecitos todos los fines de semana. No. Como en Guiñazú ya no se podía porque la policía no te dejaba hacer más nada, con toda razón, vamos a decir la verdad, decidimos hacer fiestas familiares. Estuvimos seis años haciendo fiestas familiares. El primer local al que fuimos El Bronx, en el Abasto, un local de gente a

La víctima de femicidio en zona oeste había contado que sufría violencia Un nuevo femicidio y otra muerte que causa mucho dolor. Marcelina Peloc de 44 años fue apuñalada el fin de semana en el barrio Gustavo Leguizamón, en la zona oeste. Su agresor sería su ex pareja, quien habría dado el aviso a la Policía y posteriormente se dio a la fuga. Mientras su familia espera el resultado de la autopsia y recibir su cuerpo para su sepelio, en el barrio sus vecinos no salen de la conmoción. "Me dejó fría la noticia", dijo a Somos Salta su vecina y amiga, Daniela. Habló el hijo de la mujer asesinada: "Quiero que lo atrapen y que pague" La mujer contó que Marcelina se había separado hace aproximadamente dos años del padre de sus 4 hijos. "Trabajaba conmigo en casa de familia, una mujer muy luchadora, lo siento mucho sobre todo por los chicos. Ha sido una excelente persona y vecina. Y excelente madre también", expresó. A su vez recordó que ella le había contado que sufría violencia y ello la habría llevado a terminar con la relación con Melanio Go

Recursos en Español — Michigan Celebra Matrimonio Uniendo a un hombre y a una mujer en un compromiso de por vida, el matrimonio fomenta una asociación única de amor, estabilidad y entrega mutua en la relación y de los hijos que han de venir de su unión. El matrimonio ofrece beneficios positivos para los cónyuges, y desarrolla un ambiente positivo en el que criar a los hijos, y promueve la estabilidad en la sociedad. Oración por el Matrimonio y la Familia Recursos Para La Descarga Puntos De Conversación Sobre El Matrimonio ¿Por Qué Es Bueno El Matrimonio? ¿Qué Es Único Sobre El Matrimonio? ¿Qué Ayuda Está Disponible Para Los Matrimonios? Para Los Adultos Jóvenes: ¿Por Qué Preocuparse Sobre El Matrimonio? Oremos juntos por las bendiciones de los matrimonios y familias y, sobre todo, por el sínodo sobre el matrimonio y la familia y por la visita a Filadelfia del Papa Francisco para celebrar a las familias: Padre Celestial, tu Hijo Jesús, una vez parte de una familia, es una bendición para los esposos y las esposas, los padres y las madres y sus hijos. Ayuda a nuestros papás y mamás a ser fieles el uno al otro y abiertos a la nueva vida, tu don para ellos. Guíalos a criar a sus hijos a ser buenos ciudadanos tanto del cielo como de la tierra. Derrama tu Espíritu Santo sobre las parejas casadas para fortalecer su vínculo, sobre todas las familias para que puedan hacer frente a los desafíos de nuestro tiempo con la fuerza que viene del Evangelio, y sobre nuestros hogares para que sean lugares de amor y alegría, y por lo tanto una fuente de bendición para nuestra Iglesia y nuestra sociedad. Te lo pedimos por Cristo nuestro Señor. Amén. (Se recomienda que esta oración se diga al concluir la oración de los fieles, o al final de la misa.)

El impresionante llamado de Dios a participar en la aventura de crear un nuevo ser humano comienza cuando marido y mujer participan en el acto amoroso. En la procreación y educación de los hijos el matrimonio refleja la obra del Padre de la creación (CIC 2205). A lo largo de la historia, el hombre y la mujer a través del matrimonio, contribuyen a la próxima generación de la humanidad mediante la apertura de sus vidas y comprometiéndose a los hijos.

Sergio Ramos tiene galáctico: Florentino Pérez cambia a Junior Firpo por una estrella El presidente madridista tiene a su deseado para el lateral izquierdo Florentino ya tiene a un galáctico atado y no es para la delantera. Desde el palco del Bernabéu se sigue trabajando en la confección de la plantilla para la próxima temporada El elegido para 'jubilar' a Marcelo Por eso, ya tiene atado a uno de los grandes deseos del presidente madridista en los últimos meses, David Alaba. El lateral del Bayern es uno de los futbolistas que más cumpliría con las necesidades del equipo blanco en la próxima temporada. Y se descartaría así el posible fichaje de Junior Firpo, del Betis. Es un futbolista que está en la mejor etapa de su carrera deportiva. Tiene 26 años y se considera, desde el entorno del club, que es la pieza perfecta para jubilar a un Marcelo que no seguirá la campaña siguiente, tras el bajo rendimiento que está mostrando en este curso.

27 septiembre, 2013 Artículo escrito por: Diana Garcés Antes de que empieces a leer responde esta pregunta: ¿Qué es lo primero que se te viene a la cabeza cuando escuchas las palabras: "Amor líquido"? Resulta que aunque nunca lo hayas escuchado, este término fue desarrollado por el Sociólogo polaco Zygmunt Bauman y trata acerca de la fragilidad de los vínculos humanos, y con ello se describe el tipo de relaciones interpersonales que se desarrollan en la postmodernidad. Éstas, según el autor, están caracterizadas por la falta de solidez, calidez y por una tendencia a ser cada vez más fugaces, superficiales, etéreas y con menor compromiso… Las relaciones personales de nuestro tiempo Aunque nos cuesta reconocerlo, la verdad es que las relaciones ahora no duran lo que hace algunos años. Hoy en día, hay mucha más infidelidad, aunque yo a esto le agregaría, sobre todo, que se descubre mejor a los infieles que tiempo atrás. También hay menos personas resignadas, sobre todo las mujeres. Ellas hoy en día aguantan menos aquellos detalles que le incomodan y aunque muchas relaciones se sostienen por los hijos o la dependencia económica, cuando los primeros crecen, las separaciones no se hacen esperar. Además, debemos tener en cuenta que gracias a que los tiempos han cambiado y hay tanta información, las mujeres, sobre todo, ya no se casan sin saber qué esperar. Muchas de ellas viven antes con sus novios, para luego dar el paso definitivo, cosa que hace algunos años no se hacía y las mujeres se casaban vírgenes, "desinformadas" o con el primer hombre que le ofreciera seguridad y algo de estabilidad, así no hubiese afinidad y mucho menos amor. Igualmente, las personas no aguantan la desigualdad, con esto de que tanto hombres como mujeres trabajan por igual y a veces son ellas las que ganan más, hace que los hombres se sientan innecesarios y por ende inconformes en las relaciones que sostienen. La monotonía, también juega un papel importante en las relaciones hoy en día. Hace algún tiempo se aguantaba, porque "no había más", hoy en día es mal vista la monotonía y muchas personas huyen de ella a la primera oportunidad, o algunos años después cuando adquieren el valor necesario para decir que no aguantan más. El maltrato, tanto físico como psicológico, es algo con lo que se sigue luchando pero que cada vez se denuncia más o por lo menos hay más información de su existencia, dándole así una posibilidad de escapar de ello. A todo esto, hay que sumarle el tema del consumismo actual en nuestra sociedad, lo que hace que el amor Líquido sea tan común y parte de nuestra vida diaria, ya que muchas relaciones se construyen a través del frágil mundo de Internet. Algunas de estas relaciones no llegan a ser reales y otras se construyen durante años, para luego terminar en desilusión porque a la final no se conocía realmente a la otra persona. Aunque aquí, también hay que reconocer que hay algunas relaciones exitosas. Estoy segura que El señor Bauman no pensó en todo esto cuando creó el concepto, por eso lo que acaban de leer no se acerca a lo que realmente significa el Amor líquido. Esto es lo que yo imagino cuando pienso en ello. Pondré entre mis pendientes leer más al respecto, porque me parece que es un término interesante para referirse a las relaciones interpersonales que podemos ver hoy en día. Tras responder la pregunta inicial y leer esta nota ¿se parece en algo lo que tu pensabas del concepto de amor líquido a lo que yo pienso de él? Te recomiendo este post de Francisco Fortuño que habla sobre la clase de amor que a mí me encanta imaginar que es posible: Deja que el amor te mueva 2 agosto, 2016 at 5:15 Hola! vaya, yo creía que el amor líquido tenia algo que ver con eso de fluir y dejarse llevar y resulta que es eso mismo pero con el consumismo y con la falta de solidez de la pareja. Bueno pues disfrutemos de lo qu

CORONAVIRUS: 65 MUERTOS MÁS EN UN DÍA EN FLORIDA. EL GOBERNADOR ADVIERTE A LAS EMPRESAS QUE VIOLEN LAS RESTRICCIONES ‹ Negocios Magazine Miami, martes 23 de junio de 2020. A medida que los casos de coronavirus de Florida explotan, con 65 muertes en el último día, el gobernador Ron DeSantis presionó el martes a las empresas que violan las restricciones operativas, diciendo que recibirán una visita de las autoridades estatales y los comercios podrían perder la licencia para operar. "Si entras y es como un caos, como" Dance Party USA "y está lleno hasta los topes, eso se corta y eso no es solo un error inocente", dijo DeSantis durante una conferencia de prensa en el Centro Médico Regional de Orl

Según el jefe de la dirección de estadística de la DRA, German Cutipa Flores, manifestó que dichos registros se realizaron tras la evaluación en 48 distritos de los 109, de las 11 provincias del departamento de Puno, exceptuando a Moho y Yunguyo, que no tienen población de alpacas. En tanto, la muerte de alpacas asciende a 975; sin embargo, la presencia de nevadas continúa afectando a la población de alpacas, cuyos datos de mortandad y afectaciones se incrementarán, según el funcionario público. De continuar con la presencia de nevadas en Puno, Cutipa Flores vioó pertinente la declaratoria de emergencia, para brindar alimentación a los camélidos a través de los ki

– Emi Makabe: Cuando estaba en la escuela secundaria, mi maestra de koto y shamisen pertenecía a una organización tradicional llamada Ikuta-ryu. Es típico en Japón aprender instrumentos tradicionales en cursos que son impartidos por organizaciones como éstas. Luego, más recientemente, me interesó explorar los sonidos del shamisen en mi música. Respeto, no obstante, mucho la tradición y ahora tengo un maestro de shamisen para profundizar en la forma tradicional de tocarlo ¡El shamisen es mi instrumento japonés favorito, sin duda! – Emi Makabe: Es una canción para mi compañero, Thomas. Como digo en la letra, se siente como si estuviera siempre lejos… ya que estamos separados casi la mitad del año. Simplemente me dejé llevar por los sentimientos. Siempre que lo echo de menos canto esta canción. Normalmente lo tocamos en banda pero a mí también me gusta interpretarlo en dúo. Par

Doughnut Drive-Thru – La Caverna lúdica 6 de Març de 2017 6 de Març de 2017 ~ Davidet Estamos en una panadería y debemos preparar los Donuts y otros dulces que nos van pidiendo los clientes. Aprender y recordar las recetas es primordial para preparar y servir los productos. Los clientes satisfechos nos premiarán con sus propinas. Es el 7º juego de "The Mike Line" publicado por Grail Games después de una campaña de mecenazgo en Kickstarter. Es una versión de un juego japonés publicado en 2015,"Let's Make Bread!! (Panpakapan)", cuya versión original era también una panadería, pero haciendo diferentes tipos de pan. En Doughnut Drive-Thru, los jugadores están trabajando para hornear y vender lo más rápidamente posible Donas (y otros dulces) a los clientes. El jugador que consiga más propinas al final de la partida será el ganador. 4 cartas de cocina. 4 cartas de panadero con ayuda al juego en el reverso. 24 cartas de receta. 8 Donuts de madera. Autor: Ikaga-ya. Ilustraciones: Heiko Günther. Editorial: Grail Games. Se colocan en el centro de la mesa las cartas de cocina (Aprender receta, preparar, servir y pausa para café). Dependiendo del número de jugadores utilizaremos la cara de la carta correspondiente para 2/3 jugadores o para 4 jugadores. Cada jugador recibe una carta de receta de valor 0$, las que no se usen se dejan fuera de la partida. También reciben a 2 jugadores 3 donuts de madera y a 3/4 jugadores 2 donuts de madera. Se barajan el resto de cartas de receta y se dejan boca abajo formando una pila junto a las cartas de cocina. El dado también se deja junto a las cartas de cocina. El último jugador que haya comido un donut será el jugador inicial. En su turno cada jugador puede realizar una de las 3 acciones posibles. El jugador puede poner 1 o 2 donuts en los platos de una carta de cocina, para realizar la acción de la carta. Las acciones de las cartas son las siguientes. Aprender una receta. Si ponemos 1 donut cogeremos 2 cartas y elegiremos una, la otra la descartaremos boca arriba formando una pila de descarte. Si ponemos 2 donuts cogeremos 3 cartas y elegiremos una, descartando igual las otras 2. La carta que elijamos la pondremos boca arriba en nuestra zona de juego. La carta de receta: Valor de la propina. Tirada mínima del dado para preparar la receta. Tirada mínima del dado para servir la receta. Preparar un receta. Colocando 1 donut en la carta tiramos el dado para poder preparar la receta. Si hemos puesto 2 donuts sumaremos +1 en nuestra tirada. Si conseguimos como mínimo el valor marcado en la carta, debemos girarla 90 grados hacia la derecha, quedándonos el valor de servir la receta a la izquierda de la carta

Filtran video de Pío López Obrador, hermano de AMLO, recibiendo dinero para campañas de Morena en 2015 | Border Hub Center Filtran video de Pío López Obrador, hermano de AMLO, recibiendo dinero para campañas de Morena en 2015 El hermano del presidente habría recibido el dinero de David León Romero, ex coordinador Nacional de Protección Civil del Gobierno Federal y exasesor del entonces gobernador de Chiapas Manuel Velasco, quien actualmente coordina a bancada del Partido Verde en el Senado David León Romero, ex coordinador Nacional de Protección Civil del Gobierno Federal, entregó dinero en efectivo -de parte de la entonces Administración estatal de Manuel Velasco Coello-, a Pío López Obrador, hermano del actual presidente de la República, para supuestamente apuntalar al partido político Morena en el sureste del país, rumbo al proceso electoral del 2018. El pasado 30 de julio, el mandatario nacional nombró a León Romero como nuevo director de una distribuidora de insumos médicos a cargo del Estado mexicano, y dijo que el ahora exfuncionario federal era "un servidor público eficaz, dedicado y comprometido, porque de ese nivel es la importancia de su nueva encomienda". Andrés Manuel López Obrador y su hermano Pío. Foto Zeta / Tijuana. Este ahora exfuncionario federal entregó, en su momento, durante el 2015, al menos dos millones de pesos en efectivo dentro de bolsas o sobres de papel a Pío López Obrador, fundador de Morena en Chiapas y quien también fungió como consejero nacional de dicho partido político. "Esto es para el tema de apoyarlos en el movimiento aquí […] Te voy a tener la fecha exacta para que recojan el segundo millón y terminamos […] Hazle saber al licenciado a través de tus medios que lo estamos apoyando […] El chiste es que él vea que hay apoyo", se escucha decir en el video al ahora exfuncionario federal. "Respecto al video: debe tener aprox. 5 años de antigüedad. De nov. de 2013 a nov. de 2018 yo fui consultor, no servidor público. Mi manera de apoyar al Movimiento, fue recolectar recursos entre conocidos para la realización de asambleas y otras actividades" (SIC), escribió León Romero en su cuenta de la red social Twitter. En ese entonces León Romero fungía como asesor del Gobierno estatal de Velasco Coello (2012-2018), actual coordinador del grupo parlamentario del Partido Verde Ecologista Mexicano (PVEM) en el Senado de la República, donde hace una alianza con la bancada de Morena. En el video -presentado este jueves 20 de agosto por el periodista Carlos Loret de Mola Álvarez, en su programa 'Loret Capítulo 12', transmitido en la cuenta de la plataforma YouTube, del medio digital LatinUs-, se escucha decir al hermano del actual presidente de la República que Andrés Manuel López Obrador está enterado del apoyo brindado por el entonces gobernador chiapaneco. El 24 de octubre del 2019, el diario Reforma reveló que Pío López Obrador ofreció fondos presupuestales, acceso a créditos y protección de órganos auditores a 21 alcaldes de Chiapas, siempre y cuando se sumaran a las filas de Morena. Durante su conferencia de prensa matutina de ese mismo día, el presidente López Obrador descalificó la publicación del rotativo, al asegurar que "habría que probarlo", e insistió que nadie de su familia o alguien vinculado a él, puede cometer algún acto de corrupción o de nepotismo. "Además, no sólo no deben, sino que caería en la esfera del derecho penal y serían juzgados", afirmó el mandatario nacional, quien recordó que existe un memorándum fechado el 13 de junio del 2019, en el que ordenó a funcionarios no permitir gestiones de ninguno de sus familiares para su beneficio o para "sus recomendados". "Les reitero, no acepto bajo ninguna circunstancia, que miembros de mi familia hagan gestiones, trámites o lleven a cabo negocios con el Gobierno en su beneficio o a favor de sus recomendados. Eso incluye a mi esposa, hijos, hermano

Graves pérdidas de Malaysia Airlines en el 2014 : Mi vuelo La compañía aérea Malaysia Airlines ha dado a conocer su primer informe económico del año, referente al primer trimestre del 2014. En él puede apreciarse el daño que ha provocado en la aerolínea la desconcertante desaparición del vuelo MH370 hace ya dos meses, concretamente el pasado 8 de marzo con 239 pasajeros a bordo, y del que aún no se ha sabido con exactitud qué le ocurrió. La caída de ingresos procedente del mercado chino le ha supuesto una pérdida neta de hasta el 59%, lo que supone casi 138 millones de dólares. Los ingresos, en cambio, subieron hasta los 1.100 millones dólares. Las pérdidas supusieron un aumento de hasta un 40€ con respecto al año anterior. La presión financiera que ha tenido que soportar la compañía debido al accidente se ha añadido a los altos precios del combustible y los elevados costos operativos. Las ventas en China de Malaysia Airlines cayeron en marzo hasta un 60%, con un alto número de cancelaciones, disminución de los viajes de largo recorrido y hasta la censura de dos sitios web de reserva de vuelos.

Durante la vista previa, la jueza rechazó que se analice caso a acaso como habían planteado los letrados de algunas entidades al considerar que lo que se va a valorar es "la forma en que se introdujo la cláusula, si se hizo de forma transparente", con "independencia de la situación personal de cada uno", pues se trata de una acción colectiva y, por tanto, "abstracta". Los abogados de la banca solicitaron presentar el testimonio de empleados y clientes de las entidades a fin de probar que en la firma de las hipotecas se facilitaba la información pertinente, si bien la jueza consideró "inútil" esta aportación ya que no podrían "probar que se realizaron simulaciones porque lo declaren unos testigos". Finalmente, la defensa de las entidades reclamó que se diferenciara qué demandantes tienen la consideración de consumidores, pues "algunos son particulares y empr

El centro de interpretación y la mejora de la Casa de los Verdú llenan el plan del Palmeral de Orihuela - Alicanteplaza La firma de arquitectura GYStudio se encarga del proyecto El centro de interpretación y la mejora de la Casa de los Verdú llenan el plan del Palmeral de Orihuela ORIHUELA. El Palmeral de San Antón, en Orihuela tiene en cola varios proyectos para poner en valor su protección y el entorno natural y patrimonial que engloba en su término. El Ayuntamiento quiere recuperar los valores culturales, ambientales y paisajísticos del entorno natural. Entre esos planes, cabe restaurar el patrimonio y generar rutas en torno al Palmeral para aumentar su valor para el ocio y el turismo. El Consistorio contará con la empresa GyStudio y el arquitecto Javier Gamayo para elaborar el proyecto, que verá la luz en verano con fondos del Consistorio y de los Fondos Europeos de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER). Se acaban de concretar varias de esas acciones, entre las que destacan el plan para crear el centro de interpretación del Palmeral de Orihuela y la restauración, entre otras obras, de la Casa de los Verdú, para dotarla de un nuevo uso didáctico. En palabras de Tamayo, sería la transformación parcial del Palmeral, estableciendo las bases y actuaciones futuras" del proyecto. Para lograr ese objetivo principal, se han establecido dos objetivos específicos, con actuaciones concretas para alcanzarlos. En primer lugar, los creadores del proyecto quieren lograr la integración del Palmeral en el entorno y potenciarlo como reclamo cultural y de ocio para Orihuela. Lo quieren conseguir a través de la adquisición de bienes inmuebles y de crear recorridos peatonales y ciclistas entre la ciudad y la huerta. En este bloque estaría integrada la creación del centro de interpretación del Palmeral. El otro bloque de trabajo se centrará en recuperar los elementos con valor patrimonial. El equipo de arquitectos restaurarán la Casa de los Verdú, así como el acueducto del Canal de la Escorrata. Los elementos que conforman la red hidráulica, como pozos, balsas de riego, azar

bicicleta, cuchara, manzana | jabola y su cuaderno, el blog del bolo o el boloblog sideral Posted in JABOLANCIAS by jabola on 27 enero, 2011 En la entrada anterior os hablaba de un bello rincón que de un viejo solar se ha habilitado en Zaragoza en el encuentro de las calles Castelar, Santa Rosa y Maura. De entonces a ahora, hoy, he aprendido muchas cosas sobre el movimiento "estonoesunsolar" gracias a mis pesquisas y a la impagable orientación de Gordonkly ¡y que viva por siempre Dom Blecua! Amén. Y así, he sabido por la prensa que el tal no solar está dedicado a los niños y a los ancianos con alzehimer por lo que me siento doblemente concernido. Ese rincón es mi rincón: me gustan mucho los niños y lo proclamo a los cuatro vientos en estos tiempos tan azarosos y empiezo a tener agujeros en mi memoria que ríete tú de los del ozono antártico. Si os fijáis en la primera foto de la entrada anterior se ve a su izquierda como un código de barras. Siendo tal es, además, un conjunto de pizarras en las que pue

Miroslava, Caso Resuelto: Corral – La Voz de la Noticia Internacional Miroslava, Caso Resuelto: Corral Posted on 9 enero, 2018 Author Comment(0) Chihuahua.- El gobernador Javier corral Jurado, aseguró categóricamente que el asesinato de la periodista Miroslava Breach, cometido en marzo pasado, está resuelto exitosamente por la FGE, esto durante la conferencia de prensa organizada el día de ayer en la CDMX. Señaló que la indagatoria del crimen durante su gobierno ha creado un «nuevo modelo de investigación», que incluso servirá como ejemplo para el resto de las procuradurías del país. Al cuestionarle por que encubre en calidad de testigos protegidos al vocero del PAN Alfredo Piñera y al ex alcalde de Chpinipas Hugo Amed Schultz contestó en tono molesto: «En Chihuahua no se protege a nadie»; se ha realizado una investigación profunda, profesional por parte del MP y la FGE.

La humedad de cimientos tiene consecuencias importantes para la salud, genera gastos en costosas reparaciones, disminuye considerablemente el valor del inmueble, incrementa el consumo de energía y además resulta en manchas y lesiones antiestéticas en las paredes de su propiedad. El exceso de humedad puede provocar alergias y aumenta la posibilidad de contraer enfermedades respiratorias. En personas que ya padecen asma, alergias, bronquitis o enfermedades reumáticas, un ambiente húmedo puede agravar aún más el problema y acentuar dolores. En una casa con humedad siempre estará gastando dinero en reparaciones contínuas de las lesiones. El consumo energético de los aparatos de calefacción aumenta de forma notable. Algunos objetos de valor como cuadros, muebles y pisos de parquet se deterioran con facilidad. El moho es un organismo microscópico vegetal que se reproduce en presencia de humedad por la difusión de esporas en el aire, las cuales pueden originar asma o agravar el estado de quienes la padecen. La humedad puede reducir hasta en un 30% o más de valor de un inmueble, especialmente si padece de humedad de cimientos. Es por ello que un tratamiento adecuado contra la humedad de cimientos es siempre una inversión rentable. La ironía y el humor resultan hechos pragmáticos complejos, aunque habituales en las lenguas. La ironía es un procedimiento del que se infiere lo contrario de lo dicho u otra cosa distinta, lo que exige que el destinatario del mensaje sepa captar el sentido irónico de su interlocutor. Por su parte, el humor es un fenómeno mucho más amplio que se relaciona con la esencia del ser humano: se habla, entonces, de tener o no sentido del humor, o de usarlo con fines terapéuticos, para la enfermedades mentales, las dolencias incurables o la educación. El tratamiento lingüístico y, en concreto, pragmático, de ambos hechos ha sido el objeto de estudio del grupo de investigación GRIALE (http://www.griale.es) en los últimos añ

••☑️ Cabeceros de cama palma de mallorca | ✔️ Rebajas 2021 Todas y cada una de las cabeceros de cama palma de mallorca de la gama Opera tienen un respaldo acolchado que esconde de manera perfecta los montantes de abedul en el momento en que se levanta el respaldo de la cama. Por poner un ejemplo, un cabecero extra ancho montado en la pared puede funcionar tanto con una cama de tamaño queen como con una king. Ver más cabeceros de cama palma de mallorca en Amazon Hazte con cabeceros de cama palma de mallorca Los mejores chollos de cabeceros de cama palma de mallorca También ha sido cuidadosamente elegido para acentuar el recorte personalizado, basado en su prioridad. Sin embargo, puede limpiar simplemente el algodón y el poliéster siempre y cuando sea preciso. El valor de los accesorios recibidos (hasta $300) se deducirá del reembolso si se devuelve el colchón. En lo que se refiere a la fijación del cabecero, la mayoría traen los complementos y tornillos precisos. Este cabecero no le va a costar bastante dinero y además de esto está construido con materiales de calidad. Además del dosel, este armazón también incluye barras para el cabecero y robustas barandillas laterales. Si logras un protector, tíralo directamente a la basura porque puede sospechar un peligro de asfixia para tu bebé. Da un toque relajante y clásico que puede conjuntarse con cualquier decoración del hogar. Los muebles tapizados cabeceros de cama palma de mallorca agregan un elemento de distinción a un dormitorio. Además de esto, no ocupará demasiado espacio, con lo que es ideal para cuartos pequeños. De forma frecuente puede seleccionar entre una versión despacio, media o firme. La enorme desventaja de las compañías de camas en caja online es su limitada selección. De forma frecuente, esto significa que les gusta un poco de muelle y soporte en su colchón, pero asimismo disfrutan de las características de alivio de la presión y adaptación al cuerpo que proporciona la espuma. Los yacentes más pesados tienen la posibilidad de apreciar la firmeza y el apoyo que dan los jergones ubicados en lo alto de la escala de solidez. Una capa de confort perdurable debería tener por lo menos un índice ILD de 10. Desde la funda hasta el látex y la lana, el colchón Birch de Helix está hecho de materiales ecológicos. Muchas tiendas de jergones proponen pruebas comparables a las de los jergones en línea. Estas camas no parecen un colchón hinchable, sino una cama estándar. La tapicería cabeceros de cama palma de mallorca añade un toque de encanto, distinción y lujo. La mayoría de los colchones de espuma con memoria tienen un espesor de entre 6 y 14 pulgadas. Tenga en cuenta que ciertas compañías le requieren que conserve el colchón durante un mes terminado antes de comenzar una devolución para cerciorarse de que ha probado la cama como es debido. Al tiempo que un colchón de tamaño terminado puede marchar bien para solo una persona con una composición más grande, puede ser ajustado para las parejas de mayor tamaño. Algunos jergones de espuma, sobre todo los más económicos, poseen fibra de vidrio para cumplir las normas de inflamabilidad. Las tecnologías más avanzadas, como la infusiónTitanCool™ usada en el Brooklyn Aurora, reaccionan de manera aún más capaz a su entorno. La transferencia de c

oruga de día mariposa de noche: alfombra roja globos de oro 2012 os dejo con las famosas que con más elegancia, siempre desde mi opiníón, desfilaron por la alfombra roja de los Globos de Oro Sofía Vergara, Natalie Portman, Jessica Alba, Kate Beckinsale, Sarah Hyland, Charlize Theron, Emma Stone, Elle Macpherson, Angelina Jolie, Mila Kunis. Sólo diré una cosas de una de ellas, Angelina Jolie. Me gusta su vestido, es muy elegante. Pero no le queda nada bien con su tono de piel, ella es blanquita y este modelo le hace más pálida aún. ¿A qué destaca más que ninguna? Publicado por inma en 1/17/2012 Etiquetas: Globos de Oro 2012, moda Hola Inma!. A mi me gustan sólo los vestidos de Jessica Alba y de Sarah Hyland (la tercera y la quinta en las fotos. La combinación de Angelina es verdaderamente elegante, me gustala combinación del vestido con los complementos y el maquillaje que lleva, pero lo que tú dices, se confunde la piel con el vestido, a alguien más morena le hubiese quedado muchisimo mejor. Besos. A mi uno de los que más me ha gustado es el de Charlice Thezon. Además porque adoro a esa mujer, es increíblemente guapa. Tienes razón en el look de Angelina Jolie, no le queda nada bien ese tono. Inma me encantaría que hicieras un post con el tipo de vestidos que tu te pondrías para una ocasión como esta. Quie

Fedecámaras: Mesas de trabajo no son suficiente para hacer frente a la crisis - Noticiero Digital Fedecámaras: Mesas de trabajo no son suficiente para hacer frente a la crisis Mensaje por redaccion_lg » 10 May 2019, 19:23 ND / 10 may 2019 – Ricardo Cussano, primer vicepresidente de Fedecámaras, habló en torno a las mesas de trabajo que se comenzarán a implementar y entrarán en vigencia desde el próximo lunes en el país. "Porque no hicieron caso cuando el país estaba menos deteriorado, cuando esta medida podía haber tenido éxito. Hoy es como colocarle un champú anticaspa a un calvo, no hay estructura, hoy tienes a una banca minimizada en su capacidad crediticia, entre otras cosas porque la economía venezolana se minimizó, y porque la banca se nutre de la clientela, y la clientela cada vez tiene menos bolívares, porque en título personal gana menos, o porque en personas jurídicas producen menos", expresó Cussano en una entrevista al programa En vivo de Unión Radio. Para Cussano es clave que haya una independencia del banco central en torno al tema, "La realidad es que es una medida totalmente insuficiente que no está inserta en políticas fiscales, monetarias y cambiarías que. por cierto, deberían ser dictadas por la independencia de un banco central que hoy se limita simplemente a darle a un botón para imprimir masa monetaria que, por demás, va es a suplir el déficit fiscal del gasto del sector público". Asimismo aseveró que el principal problema del país es estructural, ya que "se sufre el problema de infraestructura vial, en aeropuertos, crisis severa de luz eléctrica en el interior del país, disminuciones del talento humano, falta de financiamiento y falta del poder adquisitivo del salario, en definitiva se sufre el modelo de socialismo del siglo 21". "Yo creo que hoy, quienes tienen el poder desde el ejecutivo nacional, no tienen capacidad para remendar el daño que han hecho en la economía, lo que no significa que no puedan formar parte de un proceso de modelo distinto, aunque hoy los mercados financieros a los cuales necesitas accesar no dan credibilidad y es bastante complejo que se solvente la debacle que construyeron ése sistema los últimos 20 años", precisó el representante de Fedecámaras.

Crp: Ese Es El Valor De Laboratorio 💊 Científico-Práctico Medical Journal - 2019 Crp es una proteína que muestra inflamación en el cuerpo. Se puede determinar en la sangre. ¡lea toda la información importante sobre el valor de laboratorio! ¿Cuándo eliges CRP? valores de referencia CRP ¿Cuándo se incrementa el valor de CRP? CRP aumenta: ¿qué hacer? La proteína CRP es más detectable en la sangre en casos de inflamación en el cuerpo. Es parte del sistema inmune y ayuda a eliminar las células inmunes muertas y las sustancias extrañas del tejido inflamado. La concentración de CRP en la sangre también puede dar indicaciones de la naturaleza y curso de la inflamación. ¡Lea toda la información importante sobre el valor de laboratorio! La abreviatura CRP significa proteína C reactiva. La proteína pertenece a las llamadas proteínas de fase aguda del sistema inmune. Esto se conoce proteínas que son liberadas cada vez más en la sangre durante la inflamación aguda en el cuerpo y apoyan el sistema inmune de diferentes maneras. CRP se forma en el hígado. Si una infección se produce se une a las células muertas o inmune a las superficies exógenos, tales como bacterias y hongos, y los convierte en los fagocitos del sistema inmune está disponible. La CRP está aumentando a un inflamación reciente dentro de horas de 10 a 1000 veces y cae rápidamente de nuevo cuando la inflamación ha disminuido. Sin embargo, el valor no da ninguna indicación de en qué parte del cuerpo se produce la infección y / o inflamación. El valor de CRP se determina para las siguientes preguntas: ¿Hay una inflamación o una infección en el cuerpo? ¿Qué tan grave es la inflamación y cómo continúa? ¿Es un virus o una inflamación bacteriana? ¿Funciona la terapia antibiótica o antiinflamatoria? Por lo tanto, la CRP se determina para detectar la inflamación como una causa por ejemplo, con fiebre o el dolor en la mayoría de los casos. PCR estándar Valor Aglutinación de látex (semicuantitativa) Un nivel elevado en la sangre puede tener muchas causas y siempre debe ser médicamente aclarado. Un ligero aumento en el valor CRP se encuentra por ejemplo en infecciones virales, inflamación leve (infecciones del tracto urinario, infecciones gastrointestinales) o en el embarazo. Los niveles de CRP de medianos a altos indican una inflamación más severa o una infección bacteriana. Otras posibles causas incluyen: meningitis bacteriana (meningitis bacteriana) Complicaciones después de la cirugía (inflamación, tejido muerto) La determinación también se puede usar para la evaluación de riesgos en arteriosclerosis o diabetes mellitus. Cuando el nivel de PCR es elevado, siempre se debe aclarar la inflamación subyacente en el cuerpo. Dependiendo de los síntomas, se realizarán más investigaciones para determinar la causa. Entonces se puede iniciar una terapia adecuada. Por ejemplo, si se trata de una infección bacteriana, el médico generalmente le receta un antibiótico. En general, la concentración de CRP en la sangre luego rápidamente. La hepatitis B (también: inflamación del hígado tipo B) es u

Inicia este 2022, con candado extra de seguridad para tu información - América Retail Inicio Ecommerce Inicia este 2022, con candado extra de seguridad para tu información Inicia este 2022, con candado extra de seguridad para tu información Moises Gormes- Director, Omni Payments Mexico & Hispanic Markets LATAM at PayPal Cada comienzo de año es una muy buena oportunidad de replantear nuestros objetivos y mejorar en diversos aspectos. Una de las metas de inicio de año puede ser tener una mejor salud financiera y una buena medida para ello es tener el conocimiento para evitar ser víctimas de fraude. De acuerdo con datos de Market Intelligence, el mercado de seguridad cibernética de América Latina se valoró en USD 14,62 mil millones en 2022 y se espera que alcance los USD 37,92 mil millones para 2027. Tomando esto en consideración, sabemos que el fraude esta a la orden y que cada vez existen más técnicas sofisticadas de robo de información y fraude. Por ello, en PayPal te compartimos los siguientes consejos para ponerle un candado extra de seguridad a tu información financiera desde ahora. A continuación, tres consejos para cuidar de tu información financiera Ten cuidado con los correos electrónicos falsificados Normalmente los correos electrónicos falsos o de phishing que pudieran llegar a tu email tienen por objetivo robar tu información financiera y/o personal, como contraseñas y números de cuenta. Estos correos los utilizan como un medio engañoso para pedirte que respondas con tus datos personales o hagas clic en algún enlace que les permita robar tu información. Por ello, si llegaras a recibir algún correo o mensaje como éste, no lo abras, no hagas clic en algún enlace, ni proporciones información personal a un tercero. Ignora mensajes de texto urgentes Los correos no son el único medio que llegan a utilizar los estafadores, por ello también debes estar alerta de los mensajes de voz o SMS que puedan resultar sospechosos. A este tipo de fraude se le conoce como smishing. Comúnmente los defraudadores envían un mensaje de texto con un número de teléfono o un URL falso con un mensaje con un fuerte sentido de urgencia. Por lo general, suenan así: "Su cuenta ha sido suspendida o bloqueada debido una actividad sospechosa detectada. Comuníquese con nosotros inmediatamente al 1-408-123-4567. Es imperativo que hablemos con usted lo antes posible». «Gastaste MX$15,000 en la Tienda X. Si no realizó esta transacción, inicie sesión en mitiendax.mobileservice2013.com/txn?id=178948 para detener esta transacción. Gracias». Cuando recibes algún mensaje de este tipo, donde te piden llamar a algún número o hacer clic en un enlace y lo haces, puedes estar confirmando a los estafadores que tienes una cuenta determinada. Y, además, cuando hablas al número indicado tratando de resolver el "problema" puedes terminar compartiendo tu información personal y/o financiera a las manos equivocadas. No compartas tu información de cuenta con terceros Los estafadores a veces usan un sistema automatizado para hacer llamadas de voz, en el que te informan "problemas urgentes" sobre tu cuenta y te solicitan información de tu cuenta. Esto se llama vishing y aquí hay un ejemplo de cómo podría sonar una llamada de vishing: «Éste es Empresa X informando una posible transacción fraudulenta en su cuenta. Ingrese su PIN ahora para escuchar los detalles de la transacción. Necesitamos su respuesta inmediata para bloquear esta transacción». Si llegarás a introducir tu PIN o contraseña durante esta llamada, estarías compartiendo con l

En el Foro de las Principales Economías sobre Energía y Clima, el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador garantizó que, al final de su sexenio, 35% de las energías generadas en el país provendrán de fuentes renovables, así como se reducirán en 98% las emisiones de gas metano en procesos de producción de PEMEX. El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador participó en el en el que dio a conocer las diez acciones que lleva a cabo el Gobierno de México para hacer frente al cambio climático. A través de videoconferencia en Palacio Nacional, el mandatario se refirió a la modernización de 16 plantas hidroeléctricas a través de la renovación de turbinas a fin de incrementar la producción de energía limpia en 2 mil 85 gigawatts hora anuales. Otra de las acciones es la inversión de Pemex hasta por 2 mil millones de dólares de recursos propios y de créditos internacionales a tasas especiales en reducir hasta en 98 por ciento las emisiones de gas metano en procesos de exploración y producción en la industria petrolera. Ante el presidente de Estados Unidos, Joseph Biden; el enviado presidencial especial para el Clima, John Kerry y líderes de 17 países, el jefe del Ejecutivo expuso que está por iniciar en Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, la instalación de un parque solar fotovoltaico con capacidad de generar mil megawatts.

Recomiendan a IFE adquirir urnas electrónicas para comicios Notimex20.09.2013 - 14:57h El vicepresidente de Información Demográfica y Social del Inegi, Félix Vélez Fernández Varela, recomendó al IFE adquirir urnas electorales pues, desde su perspectiva, "el beneficio que se pueda obtener con su uso rebasa enormemente al costo en el que se pudiera incurrir". En el Congreso Internacional Tecnología y Elecciones, planteó que "en términos de costo-beneficio es altamente conveniente invertir en urnas electrónicas porque hoy en día se tiene la tecnología para que esto se haga y se haga bien, y se haga con eficiencia y precisión". Durante el segundo y último día de trabajos del encuentro organizado por el Instituto Federal Electoral (IFE), el funcionario del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (Inegi) recordó que se han aplicado medidas en el país para evitar los trastornos que los llamados hackers pudieran ocasionar a ese sistema. Abundó que utilizar ese método de votación sirve para que haya más certidumbre y eficiencia en los modelos electorales, "el beneficio que se pueda obtener rebasa enormemente al costo en el que se pudiera incurrir". Félix Vélez enfatizó que usar las urnas electrónicas redundaría en que haya certidumbre en el país, condición necesaria para la inversión, la generación de empleos y aumentar la producción. Ante expertos en la materia nacionales e internacionales, aclaró que el Inegi es una institución autónoma, por lo que pidió que a su respuesta no se le dé alguna connotación política escondida. "Lo voy a decir en términos estrictamente de costo beneficio, y ya, sin meterme a otro tipo de cuestiones que al menos públicamente en mi carácter de funcionario del Inegi no me tocan", refirió. El funcionario estimó que entre 2015 y 2018 más de la mitad de los hogares del país tendrán Internet, que actualmente es de 12 por ciento, con lo que se facilitaría el voto electrónico. Asimismo, comentó que en el Censo de 2010 no se utilizaron di

Asociación de AFP busca presidente con ayuda de headhunter y acelera gestiones para reemplazar a Fernando Larraín - CIEDESS Asociación de AFP busca presidente con ayuda de headhunter y acelera gestiones para reemplazar a Fernando Larraín Ya han tenido varias conversaciones con candidatos, pero no ha sido nada fácil: en ciertos casos el mismo gremio ha descartado a algunos ejecutivos, y en otros casos las ofertas han sido rechazadas. Esto último ocurrió con Pablo Correa, vicepresidente de BancoEstado. Fue en junio del año pasado cuando se hizo público que la Asociación de AFP estaba en búsqueda de un nuevo presidente, cargo que hasta ahora ocupa Pedro Atria, también presidente de AFP Cuprum, quien asumió la cabeza de la Asociación luego de la renuncia de Andrés Santa Cruz en septiembre de 2019. La idea de hacer este cambio, es posicionar a alguien que no pertenezca actualmente a una AFP, para que sea independiente; pero también por la alta carga laboral que significa tener la presidencia de un gremio y una AFP al mismo tiempo, considerando que solo en el último año y medio ocurrió el estallido social, pandemia, hubo dos retiros del 10% de los fondos, además de una reforma de pensiones en discusión, entre otros. En paralelo, también están buscando un nuevo gerente general, ya que Fernando Larraín partió a EEUU hace algunos meses para ser consultor del Banco Mundial. De todas maneras, por ahora Larraín reparte su tiempo entre ambas labores, e incluso tuvo que volver a Chile por unos días para estar más cerca de todo el proceso del segundo retiro del 10%. Atria es quien lidera el proceso de búsqueda de ambos cargos, de la mano de InterTrust Head Hunting, comentan fuentes conocedoras. Pese a que el también presidente de Cuprum no tiene una fecha definida de salida, por lo que no hay una urgencia importante para encontrar un reemplazo en la presidencia, sí están poniendo más urgencia en la búsqueda del gerente general, revelan quienes conocen del proceso. En todo caso, la idea, confiesan, es encontrar a la persona idónea para el cargo y no tomar una decisión precipitada. Ya han tenido varia

La Fundació Joan Miró celebra 40 años | Barcelona Cultura El día 10 de junio, el espacio expositivo festeja esta significativa fecha con una jornada de puertas abiertas, oferta gastronómica, conciertos, proyecciones y actividades variadas La Fundació Miró cumple 40 años, y lo celebra con una gran fiesta. La celebración tendrá lugar el 10 de junio de 17 a 23h y consistirá en una jornada de puertas abiertas a la colección permanente y a las exposiciones Prophetia y En construcción 1973-75, que muestra imágenes de Joaquim Gomis de la construcción del edificio. En el auditorio de la fundación se proyectará el documental J. L. Sert. Un somni nòmada, que narra la vida del arquitecto del edificio desde su juventud en la ciudad condal hasta la llegada a la Universidad de Harvard. Fuera de la fundación, la fiesta también continuará. Habrá caravanas de cocina delante de la Fundación Miró y mesas instaladas en la calle, y se organizarán diversas actividades divididas en tres franjas: Tiempo para las familias, Tiempo para los Amigos y Tiempo para todos. Habrá acciones musicales, danza, talleres, visitas dinamizadas y un concierto de soul y rhythm'n'blues a cargo de Flamingo Tours. El día 10 de junio también será el punto de partida de otras iniciativas que quieren conmemorar el 40º aniversario de la fundación. Así, desde este día hasta el 31 de diciembre todas las personas nacidas en 1975 podrán recoger un pase anual gratuito. También se organizará un concurso fotográfico en las redes sociales, que consistirá en hacer una fotografía que plasme el vínculo del participante con la Fundació Miró, colgarla en Twitter o Instagram y etiquetar @fundaciomiro y el hashtag #hemcrescutjunts. Un jurado seleccionará al mejor participante, que ganará una estancia de dos días para dos personas en Saint-Paul-de-Vence y entradas gratuitas a la Fundación Maeght, dedicada al arte contemporáneo. Durante este año, también se renovará y ampliará la colección permanente, que contará con la integración de la colección de Kazumasa Katsuta en el recorrido general de la colección. De cara a la programación del próximo curso, habrá exposiciones de artistas como Alfons Borrell, Ignasi Aballí (Premio Joan Miró 2015) o una muestra sobre Joan Miró y el objeto, entre otros. A medio camino de la cima de Montjuic, la Fundació Joan Miró abrió sus puertas el 10 de junio de 1975. Idea original del mismo Miró, el centro expositivo partió de los planteamientos de este artista para favorecer el conocimiento y la difusión del arte: miraba hacia el futuro, hacia el descubrimiento y hacia el debate. Y es que la Fundació Miró no quiería ser un museo de coleccionista sino un centro de arte contemporáneo desde donde articular propuestas de cara al mañana. Esta idea se plasma en la misma arquitectura del edificio, ideado por Josep Lluís Sert: acogedora, viva, con personalidad propia, para nada anclada en el pasado. Con el tiempo, pues, el centro de arte ha acogido muestras de artistas como Alexander Calder, Rothko, Chillida, Pipilotti Rist o Magritte, así como ha favorecido la experimentación artística y emergente a través del Espai 10 y posteriormente el Espai 13. Una celebración, en definitiva, que quiere convertir este significativo aniver

Crímenes económicos contra la humanidad – Revista digital de Humanidades Sarasuati / E-Journal of the Humanities Sarasuati Dom, jun 17 2012 | Published in C. Políticas Un sistema bancario mundial está siendo preparado aquí… y un súper-estado de banqueros internacionales que actúan conjuntamente para esclavizar al mundo en pos de su propio placer. [Louis McFadden] Es hora de hablar de ello. La tecnología ha desembocado en un mecanismo económico de control de masas. En el siglo XXI, cada vez más, ya es un hecho probado que las armas están siendo suplidas por el mecanismo financiero como vías de control y opresión. Sus variantes son múltiples, desde el clásico embargo (Cuba), a sanciones revestidas de legalidad ejercidas a través de la ONU (Irán), al nuevo intervencionismo: rescate financiero. Mediante esta misma tecnología global, se ha generado un dinero ficticio: el crédito. Anterior al crack de 1929, el dinero era intercambiable por oro. En la actualidad, desde 1933 e impulsado por la Reserva Federal estadounidense, el dinero es solo papel o un número digital en la pantalla. De esta forma, al ofrecer un dinero que no es intercambiable por oro, con existencia limitado, el nuevo dinero es ilimitado. Y este hecho es el que nos ha traído hasta la crisis de 2008, un juego bancario cuyas reglas han sido cuidadosamente establecidas para que the winner takes it all –el ganador se quede con todo-. La propia palabra secreta es repugnante en una sociedad libre y abierta, nos hemos opuesto como pueblo inherentemente e históricamente a las sociedades secretas y juramentos secretos. Y a procedimientos secretos. Porque nos enfrenta en todo el mundo una conspiración monolítica y despiadada, que se basa principalmente en medios encubiertos para expandir su esfera de influencia, basada en infiltraciones en lugar de invasión, en su elección en lugar de elecciones, en intimidación en lugar de libre elección. Es un sistema que ha construido vastos recursos humanos y materiales para construir una maquinaria eficiente, una maquinaria estrechamente entretejida que combina operaciones militares, diplomáticas, de inteligencia, económicas, científicas, y políticas. Sus preparativos son ocultos, no se publican, sus errores son enterrados, no salen en los periódicos, sus disidentes son silenciados no elogiados, no se cuestionan los gastos, no se revelan los secretos. El por eso, que el legislador ateniense Salom decretó delito que los ciudadanos se desentiendan de las controversias públicas. Pido su ayuda en la labor de informar y alertar a la población norteamericana, confiando que con su ayuda los hombres serán como han nacido: libres e independientes. [John F. Kenedy] Lo explicaré de forma muy simplificada. La Reserva Federal, un banco privado independiente jamás auditado, tiene el control y la capacidad de inyectar liquidez, esto es, imprimir dinero y distribuirlo en Estados Unidos. Además de conceder créditos con intereses, por ejemplo, al propio estado norteamericano para financiar las guerras de Iraq y Afganistán. Cosa que viene haciendo ya desde antes de la Guerra de Vietnam. También, es la entidad que ofrece capital a los propios bancos, convirtiéndose así en subsidiarios de la misma. De esta forma, el juego es simple, la Reserva Federal inunda de capital el mercado, las instituciones públicas y privadas, y la sociedad durante un lapso amplio de tiempo, para luego cortar de raíz la financiación o crédito y pasar exigir que la devolución de los prestado. Consecuentemente, los bancos y otras entidades que no pueden afrontar los pagos, quiebran. Casos de Lehman Brothers, Freddie Mac y Fannie Mae (2008). De esta manera, la propia Reserva Federal y su verdadero entramado bancario afianza su hegemonía al hacer tabla rasa, eliminar competencia, y apropiarse de, o intervenir a, bienes inmuebles y entidades ¿Nos suena esto? Sí. Grecia, Irlanda, Portugal… otras 'entidades' que no pueden afrontar los pagos. Evidentemente propiciado por sus homólogos en Europa y el Mundo: Banco Central Europeo (BCE) y el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI). El mecanismo de devaluación del dinero en la sociedad estadounidense viene determinado también por la Reserva Federal. Es decir, tienen la capacidad de poner precio al dinero, y con ello regular tanto los ingresos del ciudadano como el valor de sus propiedades. ¿Nos suena esto? Sí. Las agencias de Rating Standards & Poor, Fitch y Moody's desempeñan esta misma labor de devaluación sobre los estados, su bienestar social y sus políticas económicas. Mediante la devaluación de la calidad de la nota, consiguen un mayor porcentaje de interés para los inversores. La verdad es que un grupo de los centros financieros es dueño del gobierno desde los días de Andrew Jackson. [Franklin Roosevelt] Por todo ello, cuando se habla de crisis, se debería hablar de estafa, y cuando se habla de falta de liquidez y crédito, se debería hablar de fin de ciclo de un plan secretamente urdido por la élite, haciendo tremendamente vigente la visión distópica de John F. Kenedy anteriormente citada. El mundo está gobernado por personajes muy distintos a los que la gente se imagina que no está detrás de la escena. [Benjamin Dislaeli] En plena crisis, tras cuatro años de idas, venidas y políticas de austeridad, es hora de alzar la voz al unísono, divulgar sin miedo esta verdad, conquistar el espacio público, recurrir a la desobediencia cívica y pacífica, y exigir que existan crímenes económicos contra la humanidad, situándolos a la misma altura que los crímenes de guerra y el genocidio. Para empezar debemos desenmascarar a esa élite que yace en la sombra, y par

Vacaciones con Mario | Edición impresa | EL PAÍS Vacaciones con Mario El popular fontanero ha cumplido 20 años y visita el cubo de Nintendo con un juego de mensaje ecologista Mario Bros visita por primera vez el cubo de Nintendo, con gráficos en 3-D y mucha acción. El fontanero de mostacho prominente, vestido con el mono azul de trabajo y de figura más bien regordeta, ha cumplido 20 años. Fue en la década de 1980 cuando el genial Shigeru Miyamoto creó al gorila Donkey Kong y al fontanero, al que bautizó con el nombre de Jumpman, encargado de rescatar a su amada Pauline, secuestrada por el temible gorila. Con el tiempo Nintendo decidió cambiar el nombre de Jumpman por el de Mario, dicen que en honor al dueño del edificio donde se encontraba la sede de Nintendo America. A partir de ese momento Mario Bros se convirtió en todo un ídolo del mundo del videojuego; más de 165 millones de juegos vendidos en todo el mundo avalan su éxito. 'Super Mario Sunshine' Género: Plataformas Fabricante: Nintendo Plataforma: GameCube Precio: 54,95 euros Edad: Mayores de 3 años Internet: http://supermariosunshine.nintendo-europe.com www.nintendo-europe.com En 1982 protagoniza en solitario su primer videojuego. En compañía de su hermano Luigi debe limpiar las cloacas de la ciudad de una plaga de monstruos y alimañas. Se han hecho con su imagen películas, series de televisión, camisetas, llaveros, tazas e incluso botes de champú. Y ahora Mario Bros vuelve al ataque con este juego para la nueva consola de Nintendo titulado Super Mario Sunshine, del que ya se han vendido en Japón 400.000 títulos en cuatro días. Después de su última aventura Mario y Paulina necesitan un descanso y deciden volar hacia Isla Delfino, el paraíso de la tranquilidad y el relax. Pero Mario no podrá descansar y disfrutar de sus vacaciones: un malhechor se ha dedicado a ensuciar la isla de una pegajosa substancia parecida al petróleo. Además, el parecido del gamberro con Mario es bastante grande y los isleños han acusado al fontanero del desaguisado: al pobre Mario le toca limpiar tan desagradables manchas de la isla y su honor.

La presión de fluido es una característica de flujo importante que se requiere para determinar la aerodinámica de un sistema. Uno de los sistemas de medición de presión más antiguos y aún existentes es el manómetro debido a su precisión y simplicidad de funcionamiento. El manómetro es generalmente un tubo de vidrio en forma de U que está parcialmente lleno de líquido, como se muestra en la Figura 1. El manómetro de tubo En U no requiere calibración porque no tiene ninguna parte móvil, y sus medidas son funciones de gravedad y la densidad del líquidos. Por lo tanto, el manómetro es un sistema de medición simple y preciso. Figura 1. Esquema de un manómetro de tubo en U. Las mediciones de presión en tiempo real se obtienen en aeronaves conectando los puertos de estancamiento y presión estática de una sonda pitot-estática, un dispositivo que se utiliza comúnmente para medir la presión de flujo de fluido, a los puertos de un dispositivo de medición de presión. Esto permite a los pilotos obtener las condiciones de vuelo existentes y advertirles si se producen cambios en las condiciones de vuelo. Mientras que los manómetros proporcionan lecturas de presión muy precisas, son inherentemente voluminosos. Se necesita una solución más realista para medir las presiones de las aeronaves, ya que uno de los principales objetivos de diseño es mantener el peso total de la aeronave lo más bajo posible. Hoy en día, los transductores de presión electromecánicos, que convierten la presión aplicada en una señal eléctrica, se utilizan ampliamente para aplicaciones de detección de presión en aeronaves porque son pequeños, ligeros y se pueden colocar casi en cualquier lugar del fuselaje. Las características anteriores no solo ayudan a reducir el peso, sino que también reducen la cantidad de tubos necesarios para conectar la sonda pitotestática al transductor, lo que reduce el tiempo de respuesta de los datos. Además, en las pruebas de vuelo de aeronaves experimentales, los transductores de presión en miniatura son útiles, ya que permiten a los investigadores maximizar la recopilación de datos de presión sin aumentar significativamente el peso de la aeronave. Mientras que existen diferentes tipos de transductores de presión con diferentes técnicas de medición, uno de los tipos más comunes de transductor es el transductor de presión capacitivo. Como los transductores son capaces de enviar sólo señales en términos de voltaje y corriente, se requiere calibración del transductor para relacionar la fuerza de una señal en particular con la presión que hace que el transductor genere la señal. El ajuste de curva final que relaciona la corriente o voltaje del transductor con una medición física, en nuestro caso la presión, se conoce comúnmente como la curva de calibración del transductor. En este experimento, se coloca una sonda pitotestática en un túnel de viento subsónico con los puertos de estancamiento y presión estática conectados a los puertos totales y estáticos tanto del manómetro del tubo U como del transductor de presión. A continuación, el túnel de viento se ejecuta a diferentes ajustes de presión dinámica, y se registra la lectura de presión correspondiente del manómetro del tubo U y las lecturas de corriente producidas por el transductor. Estos datos se utilizan para generar curvas de calibración para el transductor de presión. JoVE Science Education Database. Ingeniería Aeronáutica. Transductor de presión: Calibración mediante un tubo estático Pitot. JoVE, Cambridge, MA, (2019). Para medir la presión dinámica, cada tramo del manómetro del tubo U está conectado a presiones desconocidas de los puertos de presión estática y total del tubo pitot-estático. La diferencia resultante se da por la siguiente ecuación: lo que se traduce en una diferencia en la altura de la columna en el manómetro del tubo En U. Esta diferencia en las presiones, o presión dinámica, se puede calcular utilizando la expresión: donde el agua es la densidad del agua (el fluido en el manómetro del tubo U), g es la aceleración debido a la gravedad, y elmanómetro h es la diferencia en las alturas de las columnas en el manómetro del tubo U. En algunos casos, el manómetro puede tener un desplazamiento debido a la cantidad insuficiente de líquido en la cámara y el desplazamiento en altura, hapagado, tendrá que tenerse en cuenta en la ecuación anterior como: El transductor de presión se basa en el principio de funcionamiento de un condensador, que consta de dos placas conductoras separadas por un aislante(Figura 2). Figura 2. Esquemas de un condensador (A) y un transductor de presión de capacitancia (B). La capacitancia se mide utilizando la ecuación: donde es la constante dieléctrica del material, A es el área de las placas, y d es el espaciado entre las placas. En un transductor de presión de capacitancia, una de las placas conductoras es reemplazada por un diafragma de conducción flexible, como se muestra en la Figura 2. Cuando se aplica presión, el diafragma se desvía, lo que provoca un cambio en d, lo que conduce a un cambio en la capacitancia. La electrónica del transductor está calibrada para generar cambios de voltaje específicos para los cambios correspondientes en la capacitancia, que a su vez se puede utilizar para medir la corriente para una presión aplicada determinada. 1. Calibración del transductor de presión En esta demostración, se utilizó un túnel de viento subsónico con una sección de prueba de 2,6 pies x 3,7 pies y un ajuste de presión dinámica máxima de 25 psf. Se utilizó un transductor de presión precalibrado para ajustar la presión dinámica en la sección de prueba del túnel de viento, y se utilizó un manómetro diferencial de tubo U con agua de color y escala para medir la altura del fluido(Figura 3). También se utilizó un transductor de presión diferencial(Figura 4),una fuente de tensión estándar (para alimentar el transductor) y un multímetro (para leer la corriente de salida del transductor), que se muestran en la Figura 5. Figura 3. Manómetro de tubo U de presión diferencial. Figura 4. Transductor de presión diferencial. Figura 5. Fuente de alimentación (izquierda) y multímetro (derecha). Monte un tubo estándar de pitot estático(Figura 6) desde la parte superior del túnel de viento utilizando un soporte de picadura vertical. Asegúrese de que la sonda está en el centro de la sección de prueba y está alineada en la dirección del flujo con el puerto primario orientado directamente al flujo. Figura 6. Tubo ppít-estático. Alinee la parte superior del fluido del manómetro con el marcador de doble anillo tórica en el tubo de vidrio. Si la lectura en la escala principal (en marrón, Figura 3) no corresponde a cero, elija un punto de referencia diferente, alinee el fluido del manómetro con la nueva referencia y registre el desplazamiento en altura (hoff). Conecte las salidas de estancamiento y presión estática del tubo pitot-estático a los puertos correspondientes del manómetro utubo y el transductor de presión mediante tubos de plástico flexibles y conectores de canal En. Tenga en cuenta que el transductor de presión se puede montar en cualquier superficie vertical plana siempre y cuando esté alineado de acuerdo con la Figura 4. Asegure las puertas del túnel de viento y encienda todos los sistemas. Tome la lectura para la condición de flujo sin aire (lectura cero). Inicie el túnel de viento y establezca la presión dinámica en la sección de prueba en 1psf. Aumente el ajuste de presión dinámica en el túnel de viento en pasos de 1psf hasta un ajuste máximo de 20psf y repita el paso 1.7 en cada ajuste de presión dinámica. Para comprobar si hay histéresis del transductor, disminuya la presión dinámica en pasos de 1psf hasta 0psf y repita el paso 1.7 en cada ajuste de presión dinámica. Al finalizar la prueba, apague todos los sistemas. Tabla 1. Datos recopilados para el experimento de calibración de presión Transductor P (psf) manómetro h (pulg) Itransductor Transductor WT Manómetro Multímetro En el análisis se utilizaron las siguientes constantes: densidad de agua, agua:61,04 lb/pie3; aceleración debido a la gravedad, g: 32,15 ft/s2; y manómetro apagado, hapagado a 0,8 pulgadas. La variación en los datos del manómetro para aumentar y disminuir las presiones dinámicas (con y sin corrección para el instrumento desactivado) se muestra en la Figura 7. La Figura 8 muestra una gráfica de las lecturas de corriente del transductor contra la presión del manómetro, que se calculó utilizando la Ecua

Nuevas medidas de transparencia para anuncios sobre temas sociales en Chile y México | Acerca de Meta En Facebook creemos que las personas deben de poder saber quiénes son responsables de los anuncios que ven en Facebook e Instagram, especialmente durante procesos electorales. Es por eso que en los últimos meses hemos lanzado herramientas que brindan mayor transparencia a la publicidad política y electoral en América Latina. Hoy, presentamos nuevas medidas para ayudar a proteger la integridad de las próximas elecciones en Chile y México. A partir de mediados de abril, los anunciantes de estos países que quieran implementar publicidad de temas sociales en Facebook e Instagram tendrán que pasar por el mismo proceso de autorización que pedimos para anuncios electorales y políticos. Lo anterior contempla identificar a un individuo o entidad como responsable de la publicación pagada y mostrar un descargo de responsabilidad con la etiqueta «Pagado por" en la misma. De igual forma, estos avisos serán almacenados en la Biblioteca de Anuncios de Facebook por siete años. ¿Qué consideramos un tema social? Tras las elecciones de 2016 en Estados Unidos, aprendimos que no todos los anuncios que pueden influenciar una elección están relacionados directamente con el candidato o las votaciones. Existen otro tipo de discursos que tienen un impacto significativo en la opinión pública y en la votación. Esto incluye temas delicados, muy debatidos o muy politizados sobre los cuales el público puede estar profundamente dividido. A este tipo de publicidad la denominamos "temas soci

El Senado provincial aprobó un sistema para la atención integral de personas con Alzheimer - Lu24 Actualizado: 19 Ene, 2021 8:38 pm El Senado provincial aprobó un sistema para la atención integral de personas con Alzheimer 7 diciembre, 2016 Leido: 21 La Cámara de Senadores Bonaerense aprobó un proyecto que crea el "Sistema Provincial de Atención Integral para las personas que viven con la enfermedad de Alzheimer u otras demencias", a través del cual el Estado deberá garantizar el tratamiento para las personas diagnosticadas y la contención del grupo familiar. La iniciativa presentada por el senador Federico Susbielles (FPV) fue girada el jueves pasado a la Cámara de Diputados para su posterior tratamiento. "La falta de dispositivos que atiendan integralmente a ésta enfermedad, deja a la persona que sufre Alzheimer y a su grupo familiar en situación de total desamparo.

Universidades del Cruch se llevan el primer lugar en calidad según nuevo estudio | Notas | BioBioChile Universidades del Cruch se llevan el primer lugar en calidad según nuevo estudio Un total de 9 universidades del Consejo de Rectores de Chile figuran entre las primeras 10 casas de estudios con más alta calidad en cuanto a docencia de pregrado. Así lo reveló una indagación desarrollada por el Grupo de Estudios Avanzados Universitas y liberado por el periódico El Mercurio este jueves. El escrito muestra un ranking general que considera aspectos como acreditación, el porcentaje de académicos con doctorado, el número de alumnos por cada académico, la tasa de retención de los estudiantes y los alumnos con los mejores puntajes PSU. De esta forma, la tabla quedó conformada por la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile en primer lugar, seguida de la Universidad de Chile en segundo y la Universidad de Concepción en tercero. Más atrás se presenta, en orden decreciente, la Universidad de Talca, Austral, del Bío-Bío y Católica de Valparaíso, figurando a continuación -en octavo lugar- la Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, única privada ajena al Cruch entre las primeras 10. El 'Top Ten' lo cierra la Usach y la UFRO. Debido a las particularidades de cada universidad, desde El Mercurio consignan que el estudio subdividió a los planteles según sus áreas afines. En la línea de las casas de estudio docentes, el primer puesto se lo lleva la U. de Atacama. Respecto a aquellas con proyección en investigación, el podio lo lidera la del Bío-Bío.

Sí, este finde La Lola se ha puesto la peineta de nuevo, se ha rizado la pestaña, y se ha ido hasta la localidad madrileña de Cubas de la Sagra para participar en el Wedding Day organizado por Finca Los Rosales de Cubas y Victoria Luguera Eventos. La Lola estuvo allí desde el punto de la mañana desplegando su creatividad con un stand lleno de encanto que atrapó a muchas parejas de novios. Propuestas de photo call, de candy bar, seating plan o algunas de nuestras creaciones hand made, además de unos elegantes centros de mesa para día y para noche fueron algunas de las creaciones que La Lola trasladó hasta Finca Los Rosales para mostrar a las parejas parte de su trabajo. De momento, os dejamos con estas primeras imágenes de nuesto stand. Próximamente, colgaremos fotos más detalladas de algunas de nuestras propuestas para la temporada del 2015.

Estamos hablando de la boda de los Danis, una estupenda pareja de chicos que protagonizaron la primera boda gay que ha organizado La Lola se va de Boda. El espacio, Finca Los Rosales de Cubas, una finca preciosa que abre sus puertas en la localidad madrileña de Cubas de la Sagra. ¿La fecha? El primer fin de semana de septiembre. Un tiempo increíble, mucho mejor que el que hemos tenido el resto del verano. Y los protagonistas, Dani y Daniel, una pareja encantadora que se casaron teniendo como maestra de ceremonias a Victoria Luguera. La ceremonia, por cierto, fue super emotiva. Se celebró en los jardines de la finca, y para decorarla, apostamos por la tradicional alfombra roja, con cientos de pétalos de rosa blanca esparcidos por encima, y enmarcada por grandes maceteros decorados de margarita blanca. Las sillas, engalanadas con lazos handmade, y la zona del altar, y dado que se trataba de una boda gay, llena de color, inspirándonos en la bandera del arco iris. Tules cayendo, un corazón gigante de madera de fondo, guirnaldas de hiedra y paniculata, y flores decorando las partes superiores de la estructura, y por supuesto sobre la mesa. Dani, llevó un bonito ramo de girasoles diseñado por La Lola, y su novio, Daniel, un elegante prendido en verde en la solapa. Tras la ceremonia, el cóctel, y con el cóctel, el momento en el que los invitados pudieron ver ‘El Bosque del Amor’, un encantador rincón decorado con piñas, rafias y corazones de madera con decenas de fotografías en formato Polaroid que resumían la historia de amor de esta feliz pareja. Y mientras tanto, el sol comenzaba a ponerse, como telón de fondo de esta fiesta. Tras el cóctel, la cena en la carpa. Para decorar las mesas, elegimos unos elegantes centros con gerberas y velas, con cientos de pétalos rojos echados al azar en torno al centro para dar un aire más romántico si cabe a la cena… Y tras la cena, cuando parecía que todo estaba finalizando, las últimas sorpresas de La Lola. En el entorno de la piscina, lugar en el que iba a celebrarse el baile, aparecieron decenas de velas en tarritos decorados con puntilla y rafia. La piscina, también iba decorada para lucir durante el baile. Y por supuesto, en esta fiesta no podía faltar el photo call. Un photo call lleno de encanto situado junto a la piscina y diseñado en tonos dorados al que no le faltaba de nada. Desde una espectacular alfombra, o un biombo como fondo, a un elegante sillón en el que sentarse para sacarse un retrato, además de un espejo, marcos para echarse divertidas fotos y un perchero del que colgaban objetos para disfrazarse y pasar una noche inolvidable. Dani, Daniel, muchas felicidades, y gracias por dejarnos organizar una boda como la vuestra… Categorías Bodas con encanto, Bodas en Madrid, Bodas personalizadas Etiquetas Boda gay, Boda gay Madrid, Bodas con encanto, Bodas gays, Bodas gays Madrid, Bodas gays Zaragoza, gayfriendly, Matrimonio gay, novios gays, Organización bodas gays, Organización de bodas Madrid, pareja gay, wedding, Wedding Planner, wedding planner gay Deja un comentario NUESTRO ESTRENO: BODA EN MADRID DE MARÍA E IGNACIO 24/09/2014 22/09/2013 por Nacho Viñau El enlace de Ignacio y María fue nuestro bautizo de fuego en el campo de la celebración de bodas. La feliz pareja contrajo matrimonio en una preciosa ceremonia celebrada el pasado 10 de mayo en la finca Los Cotos, en la localidad madrileña de Cubas de la Sagra. Y el resultado de nuestro primer trabajo fue el que podéis ver a continuación: una boda en la que el rojo, el blanco y el verde fueron los grandes protagonistas. El motivo de decorar en blanco y rojo fue que los novios son seguidores acérrimos del Atlético de Madrid, mientras que el uso del verde lo usamos para combinar con el traje de novia de María y los detalles en verde del traje de Ignacio.

Comercio & Comunicación, o lo que es lo mismo, COM&COM, lanza una línea propia de organización de eventos: La Lola se va de Boda. Una nueva marca desde la que queremos hacer realidad tus sueños. Bodas, fiestas, eventos personalizados… Todo ello con el estilo tan característico de Com&Com. Los que nos conocéis a Isra y a mí, ya sabéis que organizar eventos en general, y bodas en particular no es algo que nos llega de nuevas. De hecho, la organización de eventos es algo que nos ha llegado de forma casi natural. Por un lado, Israel está relacionado con las bodas y con el arte floral desde siempr

El pais con mas producciones cinematograficas del mundo se encuentra justo en el tercer mundo, en concreto en Nigeria que no solo ha sido capaz de producir más peliculas sino que ha conseguido convertirlo en un gran negocio que para algunos quisieramos. Bueno al grano, ¿cuantas peliculas ha sido capaz de producir este pais? Pues nada más y nada menos que mas de 1.500, frente a la India q

Noticias Valledupar: Colegios, Jornada académica, matriculas | Alerta Caribe Solo la mitad de los estudiantes se han matriculado en relación al 2020 La secretaria de salud teme que que haya deserción escolar en 2021. El regreso a clases en Valledupar como esperaban las autoridades, ha sido tardío. A la fecha solo 46.607 estudiantes culminaron el proceso de matrícula para el 2021. Preocupa a las autoridades que a pesar de la socialización del modelo de alternancia hay cierta negación por parte de los padres quienes no están seguros del inicio de clases en plena pandemia. "Este año siento que comenzó igual, o quizás peor. La verdad a veces prefiero que siga en casa, no he matriculado a mi hijo porque considero que hay que esperar a ver cómo avanzan los dos primeros meses" , dijo Johana Mendoza, habitante de Valledupar.

BARAHONA: Gritan por el agua. | VillaEstela05.com BARAHONA: Gritan por el agua. DIRECTOR: Yoan Medina / villaestela05.com / Fecha miércoles, noviembre 02, 2016 BARAHONA.- Continua la crisis del preciado liquido, producto principal de la dieta de los Barahoneros, por el múltiple usos que se le da por ser esencial en los hogares,. Los usuarios del principal oxigeno, dicen que no hay forma de quejarse por la indolencia que exhiben los principales jefes de mantener a la población sin agua.- Ellos ni fui ni fua, le da tres pitos, que los barrios no reciban agua, porque no tiene un Ministro o jefe que le reclame. Manifestaron los usuarios que la incapacidad mostrada por los incumbentes es que "cuando llueve, no hay agua", si hay sequía tampoco", si un ratón excreta mucho menos". Indicaron los clientes de Inapa, que apelan al corazón del Presidente de la República, licenciado Danilo Medina, que se apiade de los que no tienen cisternas, tinacos en el Municipio de Barahona y que ordene la frecuencia de agua por las tuberías sin importar que se nuble, que el agua haya de ser permanente.

SE ANUNCIAN LAS NUEVAS 790 RALLY Y 390 AVENTURA DE KTM - Dirt Bike Magazine SE ANUNCIAN LAS NUEVAS 790 RALLY Y 390 AVENTURA DE KTM La feria EICMA en Milán, Italia, está en marcha y KTM ha aprovechado la oportunidad para ampliar su oferta de motos de aventura en los EE. UU. Se ha añadido una nueva 390 Adventure a la línea, basada en el motor de la 390 Duke. Y el 790 Adventure R se ha centrado un poco más en el todoterreno para crear el 790 Adventure R Rally. A continuación, aparecen extractos del anuncio oficial de KTM. La nueva KTM 390 ADVENTURE ha aprovechado los atributos y el ADN de la increíblemente capaz y versátil KTM 790 ADVENTURE, así como la información de I + D recopilada durante casi dos décadas de éxito en el Rally Dakar. Un modelo de entrada ligero, ágil e ideal para los motociclistas que buscan descubrir el mundo de la conducción de aventuras, esta motocicleta ofrece versatilidad adicional para turismo y todoterreno ligero.Utiliza elementos de la KTM 390 DUKE como base y toma las señales de rendimiento que se encuentran en el corazón de la KTM 450 RALLY, la KTM 390 ADVENTURE ofrece rendimiento todoterreno pero con impresionantes modales en carretera como parte del paquete. KTM 790 RALLY DE AVENTURA KTM North America anuncia con orgullo que el KTM 790 ADVENTURE R RALLY llegará a Norteamérica para 2020. Restringido a solo 500 unidades en todo el mundo, estará disponible en cantidades extremadamente limitadas. Es el tercer y más reciente miembro de la familia KTM 790 ADVENTURE y se posiciona como la bicicleta de rally más capaz de viajar. Para aquellos ciclistas que exigen el rendimiento más intenso y el mejor equipo de suspensión disponible, esta es la máquina que cruzará fácilmente los continentes para llegar a la línea de salida de un rally. Basado en gran medida en la KTM 790 ADVENTURE R, el exclusivo modelo RALLY conserva el mismo chasis de acero enrejado, el potente y compacto motor doble paralelo LC8c y las ayudas electrónicas líderes en su clase. La principal diferencia de componentes es la adición de la suspensión especial WP XPLOR PRO. Desarrollado en el mismo departamento que el equipo Factory Racing de WP, ofrece un rendimiento superior para una conducción extrema. Un recorrido adicional de 30 mm de suspensión delantera y trasera ayuda a despejar los obstáculos más incómodos y eleva la altura del asiento a 35.8 in (910 mm). KTM presentó un "Bisturí" aún más nítido para 2020 con actualizaciones del color y los gráficos del KTM 790 DUKE. Con la agilidad que esperaría de un solo, mezclado con el golpe carnoso de un gemelo, talla esquinas con precisión milimétrica, con el motor gemelo paralelo LC799c de 8 cc ubicado en uno de los chasis más livianos y compactos. La súper ágil KTM RC 390 también recibió un aspecto actualizado para 2020, aportando un aspecto ultramoderno a esta bicicleta deportiva pura. KTM da la bienvenida a un noveno año consecutivo de crecimiento y otro récord de ventas en 2019, mientras continúa buscando una mayor participación en el mercado mundial y una mayor consolidación como el fabricante líder de Europa. KTM también buscará aprovechar las fortalezas de su red de distribuidores y asociaciones estratégicas internacionales. Después de una gran inauguración este verano, el trabajo, la innovación y la historia de la marca ahora se muestran fabulosamente de manera visual e interactiva en el nuevo Motohall de KTM, ubicado en Mattighofen, Austria. Trunkenpolz, junto con el director de KTM Motorsport, Pit Beirer, también se tomó un tiempo para hacer referencia al impacto y la importancia de MotoGP ™ y la presencia de la firma en el nivel élite de las carreras a medida que se acerca la conclusión de una tercera temporada en el Gran Premio. Hubo un interés considerable en otras motocicletas, especialmente la nueva KTM SX-E 5; una bicicleta eléctrica junior ajustable y versátil que tiene el potencial de introducir una nueva generación enorme al zumbido de la conducción. En lo que ahora es la moda habitual, KTM celebró sus triunfos competitivos para el año. El equipo Red Bull KTM Factory Racing obtuvo sus 18th El éxito del Dakar, así como el Campeonato del Mundo FIM Cross Country Rallies con dos pilotos diferentes. Cooper Webb ganó un prestigioso Campeonato AMA 450SX en su año de novato a bordo de la KTM 450 SX-F FACTORY EDITION. Taylor Robert se aseguró el Campeonato Pro WORCS montando su 450 XC-F, mientras que Kailub Russell, Ben Kelley y Jesse Ansley barrieron los Campeonatos GNCC XC1 Open Pro, XC2 250 Pro y XC3 125 Pro-Am, respectivamente. Además, Steward Baylor Jr. capturó el Campeonato Nacional de Enduro a bordo d

Desde el centro de Bogotá, un restaurante ha clavado las banderas de una revolución gastronómica radical, pero no desde el comercio justo o el rescate de saberes tradicionales refundidos, sino desde los platos más populares de la cocina nacional. “Que es lo más despectivo e hijueputa que los ricos han podido usar. Es un término muy peyorativo para hablar de la gente que no tiene el recurso económico suficiente para comer mejor. Primero: mire la condición económica de las personas, qué clase de educación nos dieron, cómo nos instruyeron. La gente no come “corrientazo” porque quiera sino porque no tiene para más”. Si hay algo que el ser humano tiene que hacer en esta vida es morirse y comer. Respecto al cómo y al qué comer se abre un universo de opciones que para muchos pasa por la acción automática de llenarse la barriga, para otros representa un ritual hedonista mientras que para otros tantos significa una batalla política para cambiar el mundo. En este último bando está Arturo Rojas, el que habla líneas más arriba, para quien la comida orgánica, la dieta sin gluten o los alimentos “sostenibles” son una mentira. Arturo milita de otra manera. Armando su trinchera desde un restaurante a la carta con platos populistas. Arturo es el dueño de la cadena de restaurantes Sabrosito..., que con tres locales activos en menos de diez cuadras a la redonda del centro de Bogotá, ya se ha fundido con el salpicón kitsch bogotano. Bautizado así, “al azar, simple sin ser elemental”, como dice él, es el Nuevo Testamento de su vida; una segunda etapa que llegó luego de años de haber recorrido el país capacitando profesores con con el Ministerio de Educación, organizando seminarios de literatura sobre la figura del dictador en Latinoamérica y trabajando en el empoderamiento de pequeñas comunidades de la Colombia profunda. Sabrosito… es otra bandera más para que, desde la mesa y la cocina, su revolución continúe. Nuestra conversación sucedió en la sede principal del restaurante, sobre la 7 con calle 23: un espacio sencillo que, como el propio Arturo y su aversión al WhatsApp, se resiste a pretender ser algo que no es. No más de veinte platos componen un menú que repasa los clásicos del almuerzo ejecutivo en Colombia: desde bandeja paisa y churrasco hasta paella y cazuela de mariscos, pasando por pechuga en salsa de champiñones y la estrella de la casa: la chuleta valluna. Sabrosito… se resiste al tiempo. De sus 43 empleados, la más nueva lleva nueve en nómina y la más vieja es Delia, la jefe de cocina (y jefe del sabor de todas las sedes), quien ha celebrado todos los 32 años del restaurante. Los muebles y el jardín de la sede de la 85 con 16, más al norte (local que hoy pertenece a su cuñada) se mantienen como Arturo los diseñó en los 90, mientras que el aviso, el logo y el diseño del menú son una deliciosa reminiscencia de estética ochentera. Un conservador a su manera. Mientras hablábamos sobre alimentación, marxismo, carbohidratos y conspiraciones políticas, la comida llega servida en platos blancos de plástico de dimensiones intimidantes. A algunos campos, como a la cocina y la alimentación, no se les suele reconocer como un problema político... Todo es político. Una de las mentiras más grandes que nos meten es lo de la comida orgánica. ¿Usted sabe cuáles son las dos compañías más grandes de comida chatarra del mundo? Nestle y Kellogg’s. Antes nos vendían la idea de comer cereales al desayuno cuando esa vaina lo vuelve a uno diabético. Pero a la gente le interesa la imagen en vez de decir “voy a ser solidario y sumarme a quienes hagan una campaña por la buena alimentación”. ¿Cómo insertamos un nuevo chip que cambie eso? ¿Cuánto se ahorraría cada gobierno no atendiendo casos graves de salud relacionados con mala alimentación como diabetes, enfermedades coronarias u obesidad? Primero por acción política. Quizá la utopía de mi generación era otra, no tener un iPhone, un carro o un apartamento, sino cambiar el mundo... ¡pero cambiarlo de verdad!, no con discursos. Pero nos quedamos ahí. También soy licenciado en Historia de la Universidad del Rosario y capacité profesor

Receta de Garbanzos con Verduras y Panceta Para combatir este frío que hace últimamente nada mejor que hacer platos y guisos como estos Garbanzos con Verduras y Panceta para entrar en calor. Los garbanzos son de esas legumbres que no suelen faltar en nuestra cocina tanto en verano, en ensalada, como en invierno. Sin duda alguna el garbanzo es un ingrediente imprescindible en nuestra cocina y protagonista único de muchas de las elaboraciones de nuestro recetario particular. 200 g panceta de cerdo ibérico La noche antes a su elaboración, ponemos a remojo de agua, sal y una pizca de bicarbonato los garbanzos. A la mañana siguiente, escurrimos y colocamos los garbanzos dentro de la olla rápida o a presión con el agua hirviendo. Incorporamos una cebolleta, las zanahorias enteras y peladas, y los dos ajos pelados. Tapamos la olla y dejamos cocer durante 20 minutos a partir de que comience a salir el vapor por la válvula de presión. Mientras salteamos en una sartén, con dos o tres cucharadas de aceite de oliva, la panceta de cerdo ibérico, que habremos cortado en trozos no muy grandes. Añadimos la otra cebolleta con el pimiento verde, bien picaditos. Limpiamos el brócoli, cortamos en pequeños ramilletes, y lo añadimos a la sarté

Reiki en Esclerosis Múltiple. – Asociación de Esclerosis Múltiple Madrid «Reiki» es una palabra japonesa que significa energía vital universal. En la actualidad, se utiliza para describir el sistema de sanación descubierto por Mikao Usui. «Rei» significa universal y se refiere a la energía presente en todas las cosas y lugares. «Ki» es la energía vital individual que rodea nuestros cuerpos y nos mantiene vivos. Está presente fluyendo en todos los organismos vivos. Fuente de la imagen: https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2014/03/11/22/57/wellness-285590_960_720.jpg El Reiki sería el proceso de encuentro entre estas dos energías. Es una energía semejante a las ondas de radio y puede ser aplicada tanto localmente como a distancia. Cuando hacemos uso de energía Reiki estamos aplicando energía luz para tratar de recuperar la salud física, mental, emocional y espiritual. Buscamos armonizar la totalidad del ser. Todos nosotros podemos ser canales de Reiki, no existe límite ni condiciones. No es un sistema religioso, de hecho, se utiliza por practicantes de diversas confesiones, y no desgasta al que lo practica ya que éste no aporta su propia energía sino que canaliza la del universo a través de sus manos. Está reconocido por la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Y para sorpresa de todos, está basado en postulados de la física cuántica, que propone que todo lo que existe es energía. Según los postulados de la física cuántica, ya que toda la materia del universo se encontraba junta antes del big bang, toda la materia del universo continúa relacionada después del big bang. Se ha demostrado en estudios de fotones separados de forma artificial, que en un inicio estuvieron juntos, que si se cambia el spin de un fotón, el spin de otro fotón cambia también aunque se encuentre separado de su compañero. Por tanto, según la física cuántica, la energía universal sería común a todo. Y esa energía, común a todo, podría canalizarse a través de las manos, en presencia, y también a distancia. Para explicarlo, recordemos un estudio controlado doble ciego de Masaru Emoto publicado en la revista Explore (NY), demostraba que se podían focalizar emociones positivas (energía) a distancia (de Tokio a California), y que estas emociones positivas podían modificar la estructura de moléculas de agua aisladas de radiaciones electromagnéticas en unas celdas de California.[1] Por tanto, la energía podía enviarse también a distancia, con un propósito sanador. Que no es más que lo que muchas veces hacemos desde la religión, sea cual sea aquella en la que creamos, y que puede beneficiar a la salud y modificar procesos fisiológicos cardiovasculares, neuroendocrinos e inmunitarios[2]. Cualquier persona puede ser canal de Reiki. El Reiki es una energía de amor que pasa a través de nuestro corazón y fluye a través de nuestras manos. Cuando nos convertimos en canal de Reiki, somos tan solo un medio a través del cual fluye la energía del amor universal. A partir del momento de la iniciación por un maestro Reiki, cada uno de nosotros podemos comenzar a canalizar esa energía a través de las manos: para nosotros mismos (autotratamiento), para otras personas, animales, plantas… o a distancia (cuando el receptor no se halla presente). Esa energía se envía "para lo que necesite el ser interior del receptor" ya que, al tratarse de una energía inteligente, sabe mejor que nosotros como debe actuar. Pero los efectos son siempre positivos. Produce un gran estado de relajación y tranquilidad; sensación de serenidad; mejora el sueño y a través del control del estrés, una armonización del sistema inmune. Sin apenas efectos secundarios, aunque está contraindicado en personas que sufran crisis epilépticas (podría desencadenarla), en fracturas que no hayan sido reducidas (pueden empezar a consolidar antes de tiempo), en el momento justo de una intervención quirúrgica (puede provocar que el paciente despierte) y en pacientes con marcapasos. Fuera de ello, no existen muchas más contraindicaciones. Sólo efectos positivos. En las enfermedades autoinmunes se ha observado también una gran mejoría en los síntomas de ansiedad y depresión. Existen algunos trabajos publicados sobre Reiki, pero existe mucha más experiencia de su uso clínico, sobre todo en pacientes oncológicos. En EEUU, para desvincularlo de connotaciones espirituales, en algunas ocasiones se denomina "therapeutic touch" (toque terapéutico). En Madrid se utiliza en Hospitales como el Ramón y Cajal y La Paz en servicios de oncología, en EEUU se utiliza en la prestigiosa Clínica Mayo también en programas de oncología integrativa. Hay algunos estudios que parecen indicar que sus efectos beneficiosos puedan estar relacionados con incremento de la banda de actividad theta en el cerebro, y con la sincronización de ambos hemisferios cerebrales[3]. Las ondas theta, con una frecuencia de entre 4 y 7 por segundo, se manifiestan principalmente durant

El Grinkgo Biloba es un árbol coducifolio de crecimiento lento, durante los primeros 10 años sus ramas son escasas y su tronco, de color gris parduzco, fino. Suele crecer alrededor de 20 cm semanales. Una vez desarrollado, se convierte en un árbol majestuoso de copa piramidal que llega a alcanzar los 35 metros. Sus hojas son muy especiales, en forma de abanico, lobuladas y divididas en dos partes (de ahí su nombre). Se trata de un árbol dioico, ya que sus flores pueden ser fe

¿Estamos a punto de enfrentarnos a una Superpandemia? Inicio/A Tener en Cuenta/¿Estamos a punto de enfrentarnos a una Superpandemia? A Tener en CuentaGalería de ImágenesNoticiasTe RecomendamosVirus y Pandemias Pero los científicos dicen que hay muchos más problemas que nos acechan y que algún día podríamos encontrarnos ante una súper pandemia a nivel mundial que podría acabar con la humanidad. Todo lo que necesitas es un par de "trucos" biológicos para convertir un virus microscópico en un asesino furioso como el virus de la gripe española de 1918 que mató a 50 y 100 millones de personas, o el virus SARS que comenzó en China en 2003 y se extendió a 37 países en sólo unas pocas semanas. Con el tiempo, mató al menos a 800 personas. Este año, existen dos contagios que están preocupando a los mejores epidemiólogos, son un virus asiático llamado H7N9, y MERS, o síndrome respiratorio del Oriente Medio. Ambos aparecieron en 2012. ¡¡¡Alerta!!!: Pandemias ¿Qué se necesita para evolucionar? Los investigadores médicos dicen que los virus se apresuran a evolucionar, resistentes a los tratamientos, tienen el poder letal y la capacidad de propagarse de persona a persona, por lo general a través del aire. Para luchar contra estos virus, los científicos están implementando nuevas herramientas de análisis genético para identificar a estos destructores de la humanidad, así como medidas de salud para aislar rápidamente a los pacientes y detener la propagación de una epidemia. "Las dos cosas más importantes son la virulencia y la transmisibilidad", dijo Scott Dowell, director de la detección de la enfermedad global y la respuesta de emergencia de los Centros para el Control de Enfermedades (CDC) en Atlanta. Dowell fue parte del equipo del CDC en Bangkok, Tailandia, que respondió a los primeros informes del brote de SARS en 2003. A pesar de que la epidemia finalmente no mató a tanta gente como se esperaba, dijo que el brote alertó a los medicos expertos debido a su expansión increíblemente rápida. Nuevo SARS: ¿Una pandemia potencial? "En medio de todo, no estaba claro qué dirección iban a tomar las circunstancias", dijo Dowell a Discovery News. "Fue impresionante y aterrador". SARS – Síndrome respiratorio agudo severo – es miembro de la familia del coronavirus (igual que el resfriado común). Tiene su origen en las granjas del sur de la provincia de Guangdong en China, donde dio el salto de los animales de granja y a los seres humanos en noviembre de 2002. Su material genético es impresionante, ya que se hace cargo de las células de su huésped y tiene la propiedad de replicarse. En abril de 2003, se había extendido por toda Asia y mató a uno de cada 10 pacientes infectados. Dowell dijo que lo único que permitió detener su expansión fue la cooperación internacional y la capacidad de mantener a la

Difieren en género de nuevo titular | Periódico AM | Noticias de Guanajuato, México Difieren en género de nuevo titular El alcalde Luis Fernando Gutiérrez y la presidenta de la Comisión de Equidad de Género, Guadalupe Barrera Auld discrepan sobre el sexo de quien coordi Difieren alcalde Luis Fernando Gutiérrez Márquez y la presidenta de la Comisión de Equidad de Género, Guadalupe Barrera Auld sobre el sexo de quien coordinará la Dirección de Atención a la Mujer. Por ahora el Alcalde nombró a Beatriz Adriana Villaseñor como la encargada de la dirección, mientras se hace la designación oficial. Y es que Iovana Rocha Cano renunció el 31 de agosto al cargo como titular de la Dirección de Atención a la Mujer. "Se requiere una persona que tenga del tema de equidad y género, y estaremos dándonos a la tarea de proponer a alguna terna o tal vez él ya tenga la persona idónea", apuntó Barrera Auld. Incluso la presidenta de la Comisión de Equidad de Género indicó que cuando se diluyó el Instituto de Atención a la Mujer, llegó un curriculum de un joven muy empapado en cuestiones de equidad de género. "Es un joven incluso con estudios en el extranjero en América del Sur, en Colombia. Es un curriculum bastante completo para pres

good evening id like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission apollo 11 as weve been dis cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft weve come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon more still than the efforts of a government and industry team more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown nells statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon this is a small step for a man but a great leap for mankind i believe sum up these feelings very nicely we accepted the challenge of going to the moon the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission i beieve is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance today i feel were flly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace in retrospect we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously goss net 1 ape 1124 chose for our spacecraft columbia and eagle weve been particularly pleased with th

También se realizó secuenciación de bisulfito del genoma completo y secuenciación del ARN. El equipo utilizó la secuenciación del genoma en el tejido tumoral e identificó una translocación de material genético entre los cromosomas 4 y 9, que estaba presente en todos los carcinomas directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago células acínicas examinados. Típicamente, tales translocaciones en tumores conducen a una nueva combinación de genes, que luego adquieren nuevas propiedades oncogénicas. En el caso de los carcinomas de células acinosas, la translocación que se ha descubierto hace que los elementos reguladores del ADN se transfieran de una Adelgazar 30 kilos cromosómica activa a un oncogén normalmente inactivo. Cuando los cromosomas se reorganizan, estos elementos reguladores altamente activos se ubican cerca del gen del Miembro 3 del Grupo A directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la Subfamilia 4 del Receptor Nuclear NR4A3que generalmente se apaga una vez que se completa el desarrollo embrionario.

Aunque se atribuían muchos defectos a la riqueza y la propiedad privada, ordinariamente la conclusión no era la abolición de estas instituciones en un mundo imperfecto. Para la multitud de la gente ordinaria, la conclusión no era la institución de la propiedad comunitaria sino directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago necesidad de la caridad. En esto los Padres insisten en los términos mas enérgicos. La propiedad privada era tolerada pero no se le consideraba sacrosanta. Por derecho humano, sin embargo, alguien dice, esta tierra es mía, esta casa es mía, este es mi sirviente. Por derecho humano, esto es por derecho de los emperadores. La tolerancia de la propiedad privada tuvo su directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago también en el reconocimiento del valor de ciertas actividades económicas. No se consideraba sin embargo que todas las actividades económicas fueran censurables. El valor y la dignidad del trabajo humano fue enfatizado por varios de los Padres de la Iglesia. Llegó a pensarse - como llegó a ser prominente con los escritos de Adam Smith quince siglos después - que las actividades económicas perseguidas con fines de ganancia privada pueden tener como resultado un beneficio para la sociedad. La Edad Media. Con los invasores. Estas guerras eran costosas. Equipar solamente a un caballero requería un desembolso equivalente a la compra de veinte bueyes, o el equipo de labranza de diez labriegos. Bajo el feudalismo la propiedad de la tierra no era absoluta y divorciada de ciertos deberes como la había sido en Roma y como ha vuelto a ser en los tiempos directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago. La propiedad original de la tierra era del rey, el señor todopoderoso. Pero su derecho estaba directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago a la prestación de cierto tipo de servicios, militar, personal, de trabajo, o entrega de los productos. Pero la propiedad feudal no era solamente sujeta de derechos. Era también la base del poder político. Los señores feudales estaban investidos de numerosas funciones gubernamentales, disposición que nacía de la debilidad de las autoridades centrales en tiempos de pobres comunicaciones e inseguridad general. La Escolastica. Proviene del latín schola y era, esencialmente:. La Propiedad Privada no es contraria a la Ley Natural. Reglamentación de la Propiedad. La Mayordomía de la Riqueza. Con respecto a la adquisición y disposición Adelgazar 10 kilos justifica la propiedad privada sobre la base de las razones dadas por Aristóteles. directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago Parabéns pela conquista e ótimo vídeo. Este deber, que refleja la idea de la mayordomía de la riqueza, puede ser cumplido mediante actos de caridad, liberalidad, y magnificencia. En un pasaje de sus escritos discute el deber de compartir con otros las propiedades cuando la ley humana es suspendida bajo condiciones de urgente directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago, cuando la apropiación de los bienes deja de ser un robo. Te reto a dar like con el codo Los Escolasticos tardíos o Salmantinos. Se radicaron principalmente en Salamanca. Su objetivo era el de comprobar si el derecho de propiedad privada estaba de acuerdo con la ley natural y la ley divina. Aquellos que se oponían a la propiedad privada frecuentemente se amparaban en el pasaje del joven rico. Muchos interpretaban que con esta actitud nuestro Señor Jesucristo directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la posesión de riquezas. Valorar una cosa creada por encima de su creador, tal directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago lo hizo el joven rico al preferir las riquezas al mandato divino, es ir en contra del orden natural. Muchas personas cercanas a Cristo eran ricas. NOVIEMBRE LME | Potasio | Hibridación in situ fluorescente San Francisco de Sales, explicó la actitud de pobreza, aun siendo ricos, de esta. Justamente por ser estos bienes escasos fue necesaria la propiedad privada, porque cuando los bienes son de todos no son de nadie, nadie se preocupa por su mantenimiento, pero todos quieren usufructuarlo. Desaparecería la virtud de la liberalidad, porque quien no posee nada propio no puede ser liberal. También desaparecía la directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago de la hospitalidad. Se percata del hecho de que la propiedad privada es el mejor medio para mitigar la escasez de los bienes económicos. Juan de Mariana reconoce la importancia que tiene el interés personal para el bienestar económico. Cuando los bienes se tienen en privado es mas difícil que existan fraudes. Luis de Molina, en su obra De iustitia directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago iure incluyó muchos argumentos en favor de Adelgazar 20 kilos propiedad privada. La escasez se agravaría y la gente se pelearía por el uso y consumo de los bienes. Los poderosos explotarían inevitablemente a los débiles. Francisco de Vitoria daba gran importancia a la propiedad privada, porque esta permitía el uso moral de los bienes. Las limosnas se deben realizar con los bienes propios y no con los comunes. Las virtudes de la caridad, liberalidad, hospitalidad y generosidad se dificultarían enormemente en un mundo sin propiedad privada. No siguió la saga u.u como fan de Zelda sigo esperando otro capítulo Este, puede ser definido como aquella parte del sistema. Señalaba que estos principios no son evidentes por sí mismos, provienen de razones utilitarias. Sin propiedad privada los bienes serían mal cuidados y la paz entre los hombres se tornaría imposible. La propiedad privada hace posible un orden social justo. El mal existe porque. La propiedad privada es conveniente para mantener el orden en la sociedad y. Justamente con el pecado original aparece el problema de la escasez, que es el origen de los problemas económicos. El Mercantilismo. Con la aparición de esta corriente económica, que ha de durar años, que pretende que el interés nacional va de la mano con el de la clase mercantil, el concepto de propiedad y riqueza toman un aspecto mundano y secular. John Locke. Locke toca también el problema de la desigualdad de la riqueza, aunque sin resolverlo satisfactoriamente, en sus Dos Ensayos sobre el Gobierno Civil, su gran contribución a la filosofía política. Locke desarrolla esta teoría sobre el fondo de un estado natural directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago no es necesariamente una situación histórica, sino la que hubiera podido existir en ausencia de un gobierno y una sociedad civil. Para Hobbes, el estado natural hubiera sido directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago guerra de todos contra todos, donde la fuerza y el engaño hubieran prevalecido. Para Locke, sin embargo, el estado natural no sería un estado sin ley, sino ordenado por la ley natural. El fin principal de que los hombres creen este medio de convivencia es para la mutua defensa de sus vidas, libertades y pertenencias, o sea todo aquello a lo que Locke da el nombre general de propiedad.

Bonjour Guy ! Merci pour votre combat ! La ansiedad se puede volver un problema cuando los síntomas, duran mucho tiempo, se convierten en graves y desagradable, cuando ocurren con demasiada frecuencia. websiovideo-2391. Locke usa la palabra propiedad tanto en su sentido amplio, en el que abarca una extensa gama de intereses y aspiraciones humanas, como en un sentido estricto, cuando se refiere a los bienes materiales. Al considerar que la propiedad es un derecho natural que se encuentra por encima del gobierno, Locke difiere de Hobbes, para quien la propiedad es una creación del gobierno soberano. Al hacerlo proceder del trabajo, discrepa también de otros exponentes de la ley natural, que consideran que depende de un consentimiento general o de un contrato. La Teoría del Valor Trabajo. Del mismo modo que el cuerpo es propiedad directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago cada uno, así directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago también con el trabajo de su cuerpo, y con la labor de sus manos. Al aplicar el trabajo a los productos de la naturaleza, el hombre se apodera de ellos y los hace su propiedad. El directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago no es solo el origen de la propiedad, sino que marca también la diferencia del valor entre las cosas. Locke considera que el trabajo representa el noventa por ciento del valor de las cosas, atribuyendo el resto a la naturaleza. Los Límites a la Acumulación. En el estado natural, el trabajo que crea la propiedad, contiene también en sí mismo uno de los límites a la acumulación: la capacidad de producción del hombre. EL otro límite es la capacidad consumo del hombre. Ambas son consideradas por Locke como lo suficientemente moderadas como para impedir que las mercancías se estropeen o desperdicien, o que los hombres se roben unos a otros. A living autotune. Outstanding Mediante estas limitaciones a la acumulación de bienes perecederos y los factores que los producen, era posible evitar lo que Locke consideraba como una ofensa contra las leyes de la naturaleza: el desperdicio. La introducción del dinero marca la culminación de este proceso. La introducción del dinero hace posible la acumulación ilimitada de propiedad sin que se produzcan pérdidas por el desperdicio. El mismo consentimiento de la humanidad que da valor al oro y a. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la introducción del dinero se desvanecen los límites que la ley natural había puesto originalmente a la acumulación y a la desigualdad. Locke no admite explícitamente que haya un conflicto entre la ley natural y lo que el hombre ha dispuesto por consentimiento general. La Fisiocracia. El individualismo de los fisiócratas se complementaba con un profundo respeto directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la propiedad privada. Como Locke, Quesnay funda la propiedad privada en el trabajo, pero funda también el trabajo en la propiedad: es la seguridad de que se va a poseer una Adelgazar 50 kilos de cosas, dice, lo que induce al hombre a realizar el trabajo necesario para el bienestar de la sociedad. Los fisiócratas directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago de la propiedad de un hombre como la medida de la libertad de la que disfrutan. Para ellos la función primordial del orden positivo era la protección del derecho de propiedad. Quesnay resalta que la libertad y la igualdad son incompatibles. Carlos Marx. Como Locke, Marx considera que el directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago y la propiedad emanan del trabajo. Afirma que el trabajador es despojado del valor por el creado y por tanto de su propiedad por el capitalista. Doctrina Social de la Iglesia Católica. La abundancia de esta doctrina sobre el tema de la propiedad es considerable. Por ello trasladaremos aquí sólo algunos de sus principales conceptos. El que no quiera a Pablo se muere Quadragesimo Anno, m. Pío XII, en cuyo pontificado apareció con mayor agudeza la amenaza de la destrucción total del hombre por los sistemas de poder del comunismo, nazismo. En esta relación se debe contemplar La buena dieta doctrina acerca de la propiedad:. Otorga ser humano la base de seguridad material que es tan importante para el. XII, Radio mensaje del 1 de. Para Pío XII, el aprovechamiento de los bienes terrenales que no sea personal, va contra la dignidad humana, ya que a la persona pertenecen también libertad y autodeterminación, que se extienden al aprovechamiento de los bienes materiales. Solamente quien impugne al hombre la dignidad directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la libre personalidad puede reconocer la posibilidad de substituir el derecho a la propiedad privada Pío XII, discurso del 20 de Mayo de También el Concilio Vaticano II se dirige a la relación mutua entre libertad económica y libertad cultural, política directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago espiritual. Gaudium et Spes, n. Así como la Igleasia ha rechazado el objetivo socialista de la directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago de la propiedad privada por incompatible con la dignidad humana y el orden social humanamente digno, así tampoco ha dejado en duda que una reglamentación de la propiedad sin vinculación social iría en contra del hombre y de su obligación social. A este respecto destacan directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago planteamientos:. Paulo VI, Populorum Progressio, 22 y Noventa años después de directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago Rerum Novarum Juan Pablo II afirma que toda la vida socioeconómica debe estar presidida por un principio: la prioridad del trabajo sobre el capital. En la Rerum Novarum se busca en la propiedad privada el fundamento de todo el orden Adelgazar 40 kilos, mientras que en la Laborem Exercens la propiedad, sea privada o colectiva, no es mas que un instrumento al servicio del trabajo. Cada uno de esos principios éticos no tiene consistencia total por sí mismo, sino en cuanto forma parte de un sistema. Pero tampoco la afirman. La Justicia. Interesa captar el significado que de hecho ha tenido en la historia de Occidente a fin de señalar a continuación la validez que tiene en la actualidad. El significado de la justicia debe ser analizado a partir de las coordenadas ideológicas en que aparece. Pensamiento Judeocristiano. Introduce en la noción de justicia los rasgos de: mesianismo, escatología, utopía. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago el judío cristiano la justicia es una promesa divina y una decisión humana, es un ideal absoluto y una concreción de la Bondad. La Filosofía Griega. En boca de Glauco y Adimante pone la opinión de que los hombres buscan siempre su propia ventaja, y encuentran ventajoso el cumplir las leyes, lo que constituye la justicia. A cada uno la función social que merezca por el conjunto de sus cualidades físicas, intelectuales y morales: tal sería para Platón la definición de la justicia social. La justicia mantiene el orden entre las tres clases de ciudadanos filósofos, militares, trabajadores. Esta deducción de la definición de justicia se apoya en consideraciones utilitaristas. Pero esto no quiere decir que sean el fundamento de la justicia. Se debe reconocer que las virtudes de los ciudadanos son las que determinan las de la Ciudad. Y en especial la Ciudad no puede ser justa si no lo son los propios individuos. Ahora bien, existe una misteriosa correspondencia entre la estructura del alma y la Ciudad. El alma, a su vez, se compone de tres partes, que son, la concupiscencia, la cólera, directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la razón. Es justa cuando sabe dar a cada una el directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago que le corresponde. Justicia Aristotélica Aristóteles. El principio de moderación, ya discutido, es central en el pensamiento de Aristóteles. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago él subyace el concepto Aristotélico de virtud. Se distinguen varios tipos de justicia, incluida la justicia distributiva y la justicia correctiva. La justicia distributiva tiene que próstata cea wert con la distribución de la riqueza y los honores en la sociedad. No son distribuidos de manera igual sino en proporción a los méritos o valor individual de cada ciudadano. Mientras que la justicia distributiva establece una diferenciación de esta manera, la justicia correctiva iguala. Se relaciona con la corrección de males por el juez al reducir la ganancia de una parte y la pérdida de la otra.

Segundo, queremos conocer el significado del lado izquierdo de la ecuación, la razón del constructor al directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago. La respuesta que sucesivas generaciones de intérpretes del pensamiento Aristotélico ha dado a la primera pregunta ha reflejado el pensamiento. Así, conforme a esta interpretación, la teoría Aristotélica del cambio era. En el curso de los. De acuerdo al punto de vista que ha venido a reemplazar gradualmente la teoría del valor-trabajo, el valor de un bien es interpretado subjetivamente y derivado de su utilidad. Esto anticipa directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago noción moderna de los rendimientos decrecientes. Esto es. La segunda pregunta - el significado del lado izquierdo de la ecuación - ha preocupado mucho a los estudiosos. Para resolverlo debemos recordar lo que ya hemos anotado respecto del examen de Aristóteles sobre la justicia distributiva, esto es, que en sus ecuaciones personas y bienes aparecen lado a lado y que. Una vez que xD es igualado con C - en términos de trabajo o en términos de utilidad. Lo que podría interpretarse como implicando que el intercambio de equivalentes ha dejado a los participantes iguales en términos de satisfacción. A la luz de la teoría del directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago no es apropiado hablar de Aristóteles como. Si A es una casa, B directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago unidades de dinero y C una cama; y si. La Justicia en el Derecho Romano. El derecho romano es rico en conceptos sobre la justicia. La definición mas conocida es atribuida a Ulpiano quien dice: Iustitia est constans et perpetua voluntas ius suum cuique tribuendi. La voluntad perpetua y constante de dar a cada quien lo que le corresponde. Señalaba Aristóteles que la justicia. Ahora bien, en la concepción aristotélica, lo justo en las distribuciones se logra cuando las mismas se realizan atendiendo al mérito. La distribución debe ser proporcional en relación con el mérito. Los bienes privados no son objeto de esta justicia. Estamos pues, en presencia del concepto aristotélico de justicia distributiva. Ahora bien, toda parte puede ser considerada en un doble aspecto: uno, en la relación de parte a parte, al que corresponde en la vida social el orden de una persona privada a otra, y este orden es dirigido por la justicia conmutativa, consistente en los cambios que mutuamente se realizan Dietas rapidas dos personas. Este concepto de justicia distributiva es conforme al principio general de dar a cada uno lo suyo. Así podemos llegar ya a la primera conclusión: la justicia distributiva trata del reparto de los bienes comunes. De ahí surge la respuesta de quién es directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago responsable de que exista justicia distributiva. La justicia distributiva solamente reside en el resto de los individuos de una manera pasiva. También se extiende el concepto a la Dietas faciles, en la que la responsabilidad de repartir los bienes comunes reside en el padre de familia. El Justo Precio. La situación era diferente respecto a otro problema importante en la economía medieval, el justo precio. La violación excesiva era una excepción muy estrecha a esta regla, aplicable solamente a transacciones con tierras y con precios que fueran indebidamente bajos. La desviación debe ser considerable. El justo precio era el precio corriente prevaleciente en un lugar dado en un tiempo dado, a determinarse por la estimación de una persona recta. La cuestión general, qué es la justicia, y la especial, qué es el justo precio, nunca han dejado de ser premisas inquietantes para el estudioso. Otros lo han interpretado como un exponente de la teoría subjetiva del valor, que considera el valor económico de un bien como derivado de su utilidad. Domingo de Soto concluye con una advertencia:. Y así ni directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago que los bienes se repartan con demasiada. Sobre todo han de evitar siempre que los tributos y censos que se imponen al pueblo con destino a las. Martín de Azpilcueta señaló que los gobernantes cuando cobran directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago injustamente violan la justicia distributiva. Una de las actitudes típicas que examen histológico de próstata pt cruiser la justicia distributiva es la acepción de personas nepotismo Es una injusticia que se comete en la distribución de los bienes comunes, cuando se prefiere a uno, no por los méritos, sino por otra causa no debida. La aceptación de personas no sólo es condenada por desventajosa para la sociedad sino éticamente. Pedro Ledezma señala que, para no violar la justicia distributiva, estos impuestos deberían cumplir cinco condiciones:. Que el que directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago el tributo sea una autoridad legítima. Esta po dría ser:. El Papa. El Concilio. El Emperador. Que la causa final de tributo sea justa y que redunde en bien y utilidad de la. Los tributos han de ser proporcionados con la causa final por la que se ponen.

Las diferentes formas de gobierno. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago opinión de Hobbes, para los hombres que viven en una condición meramente natural, las nociones de justicia e injusticia no se aplican. The aim of the study is to explore the different components of the nutrition assistance process, such as nutrition screening tools and interventions, in adult oncologic patients. The study design is a systematized review in which all the studies of the last 16y about the nutritional status assessment or nutrition support or counselling in cancer patients, were included. Pediatric, domiciliary patients, palliative care and prevention studies were excluded. The latter two are the most validated tools for this population and present a high sensitivity and specificity scores. As for the interventions, there are the ones about nutrition support by nutrition counselling or by artificial nutrition focusing on inmunonutrition based directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago arginine, Omega-3 fatty acids, nucleotides, and glutamine compounds. Finally, a Spanish study revealed that the Spanish NHS fails in the nutrition assistance on the oncological patient, in spite of the fact that there are enough health professionals and tools to treat it. A suitable early nutritional Adelgazar 20 kilos will lead to a complete cancer treatment, a higher survival rate and lower toxicities. Lo que confiere la característica de malignidad a esta proliferación celular es su capacidad para invadir órganos y tejidos y diseminarse a distancia1. Por el contrario, durante el curso de la enfermedad, cuando el cuerpo no consigue o no puede absorber los nutrientes necesarios para la salud, se produce una afección que se llama desnutrición o malnutrición5. El enfermo oncológico presenta malnutrición asociada tanto a las características que definen al tumor maligno como al tratamiento que es preciso aplicar. En el estudio de Sharma D. Así mismo los diferentes tipos de tratamientos aplicados en el enfermo oncológico son también una causa importante de alteración del estatus nutricional de los mismos9. Objetivos 2. Metodología 3. Se descartaron también estudios dedicados a cuidados paliativos o enfocados a prevenir la enfermedad. Después de retirar los documentos duplicados, se obtuvieron artículos. Finalmente 17 documentos fueron incluidos. Por otro lado, intervenciones nutricionales de educación y consejo nutricional durante el tratamiento a pacientes y familiares también resultaron de interés. Se encuentran en la Tabla Adelgazar 15 kilos del Apartado de Anexos. Resultados Se recuperaron 17 estudios que cumplían los criterios definidos. Directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago resultados se presentan en dos grandes bloques: 4. Valoración del estado nutricional La pérdida de peso y la desnutrición es frecuente en pacientes oncológicos, siendo ambas origen de complicaciones durante el transcurso de la enfermedad por lo que la De los resultados obtenidos, se puede definir la valoración del estado nutricional como procedimientos o métodos subjetivos u objetivos directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago permiten conocer el estado nutricional de los pacientes atendiendo a unos criterios preestablecidos.

La puntuación del PG-SGA puede ser utilizado como una medida objetivo para demostrar el resultado de la intervención nutricional. @viwitaful Thank you for believing this. Debido a su agrupación categórica, a menudo es difícil demostrar una mejora en el estado nutricional sobre la base del SGA. Sin embargo mediante la realización de Por otro lado, Adelgazar 30 kilos uso de esta herramienta debe de ser realizado por directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago entrenados. En el estudio de C. Gómez-Candela y cols La kappa de Cohen es de 0. Roulston et al. La ventaja con respecto al SGA es que depende menos de la capacitación y experiencia del evaluador. El valor predictivo positivo es de 0,4 y el valor predictivo negativo de 1,0. Intervenciones nutricionales: Soporte nutricional El soporte nutricional es una intervención paso a paso la cual debe ser gestionada de forma activa y selectiva para cada paciente de acuerdo con las condiciones nutricionales, estado clínico, el planeamiento del tratamiento oncológico y el resultado que se directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago. Sin embargo no hubo beneficio de la terapia nutricional sobre la calidad de vida pero se mantuvo el peso corporal y las funciones físicas. Esto pudo haberse debido a que los pacientes fueron incluidos demasiado tarde con el curso de la enfermedad avanzado. Para asegurar la reproducibilidad y consistencia de la intervención nutricional individualizada, todos los pacientes del grupo intervención fueron aconsejados por el mismo dietista siguiendo un procedimiento predeterminado. En un primer paso, el dietista recogió toda la información necesaria como la historia clínica, recuento de la ingesta, severidad de la enfermedad, tratamiento, directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago psicológicos, síntomas de relevante importancia relacionados con la nutrición, entre otros datos. Se pidió a los pacientes consumir por lo menos una taza kcal, 18 g de proteínas diariamente. Seis semanas y 3 meses después del inicio de la terapia nutricional, la dietista aplicó el mismo formulario de evaluación que al inicio. El objetivo primordial de la intervención nutricional fue que los pacientes pudieran completar las necesidades energéticas y proteicas calculadas. El asesoramiento dietético se ajustó a los patrones de alimentación El grupo de terapia nutricional recibió un tratamiento adecuado a la medida de las necesidades del paciente y el curso de la enfermedad. El estudio de Rock C. En particular, los efectos beneficiosos fueron observados notablemente, los 3 meses después de la finalización de directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago radioterapia. La intervención se basó el en el consejo nutricional a dos grupos de pacientes.

Ética Corporativa. Antología por M. La Naturaleza de la Ética. Probablemente el gran pecado de la Universidad occidental haya sido el abandono del estudio de las humanidades, particularmente de la ética, en aras de la magnificación de un pretendido cientificismo. Soy de Guadalajara y la neta no lo conozco macalaquech El estudio de la filosofía ha venido a ser substituido por el de las ciencias. Existe una relación íntima entre la teoría ética general y la ética aplicada en un contexto corporativo ya que la ética de directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago persona no puede estar divorciada de la conducta ética en el ambiente organizacional. Roger L. En México es relativamente reciente la introducción de cursos de Ética Corporativa en las Universidades. Nosotros seguiremos este criterio a lo largo del curso. La Corporación y la Ética Organizacional. El enfoque principal de este curso es la ética aplicada al entorno de la corporación. Por Corporación significaremos cualquier organización cuyo objetivo es proporcionar bienes y servicios a cambio de una utilidad aunque sus conceptos son igualmente aplicables a instituciones no lucrativas. Moral y Etiqueta. La Etiqueta se refiere a cualquier código especial de conducta o cortesía. La observancia escrupulosa de las leyes directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago etiqueta no hace moral a una persona. De hecho, disfrazar premisas morales que sólo romper las reglas de etiqueta puede hacer evidente. Moral y Ley. La mayor parte de los negocios pueden fijar precios a sus productos o servicios. Dentro de las restricciones del salario mínimo, pueden pagar a sus trabajadores lo que se les antoje. Aunque resulta de utilidad en advertirnos respecto a premisas morales. La conformidad con la ley no es suficiente para determinar la Adelgazar 30 kilos moral como vimos con las reglas de etiqueta. Igualmente, el no apegarse a la ley no es necesariamente inmoral, si la ley que se desobedece es injusta. Códigos de Ética profesional. Los códigos de ética profesional caen entre la etiqueta y la ley. Por su naturaleza, los códigos de ética profesional no son completos ni representan una guía confiable respecto a las obligaciones morales. Religión y Moral. Cualquier religión proporciona a sus creyentes cierta visión del mundo, lo que incluye ciertas instrucciones morales, valores, y compromisos. La religión, involucra no sólo un sistema formal de adoración sino que incluye prescripciones respecto a las relaciones sociales. Sin embargo, los ideales religiosos pueden resultar muy generales, aunque algunos cuerpos religiosos articulan posiciones acerca de premisas políticas, educativas, higiénicas, económicas y médicas. La Iglesia católica, entre otros puntos, da particular importancia a la aplicación de los directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago morales en el entorno corporativo, particularmente en lo relativo a las relaciones laborales. Muchas personas piensan que la moral debe estar basada en la religión. Otros la consideran como derivada de un mandato divino. Ambas opiniones son incorrectas. A menudo actuamos moralmente simplemente porque esta es la clase de persona que somos. Segundo, las instrucciones morales de las grandes religiones del mundo son generales y vagas. Relativismo y Absolutismo en la Ética. Cualquier postura ética que niegue que existe un sólo principio singular que sea igualmente aplicable a todos los hombres en todos los tiempos puede ser llamado relativismo ético. Wait, I thought this was a joke? Especially when he started opening those bottles of beer :P Lo que la moral ordena en un lugar o época puede ser diferente en otras circunstancias. Por lo tanto, la ética es relativa a la época, al lugar, y a las circunstancias en las que se le encuentra. Esto no quiere simplemente decir que se piense directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago la misma clase de acción es correcta en un país y un período y se piense que es incorrecta en otro, lo que cualquiera podría admitir. Pero cuando el término es usado en este sentido significa simplemente el conjunto Adelgazar 50 kilos ideas morales en boga durante el período en cuestión. Para el absolutista existen principios morales universales. Para el directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago existen sólo principios locales, efímeros y variables. Argumentos en favor del relativismo:. Las investigaciones antropológicas muestran que existen lado a lado en el mundo una amplia variedad de códigos morales. Argumento débil. Se basa en un conjunto de hechos singular - las variables costumbres del mundo, lo que admiten ambas corrientes. El segundo argumento es mas fuerte. Consiste en alegar que nadie ha sido capaz de descubrir sobre qué bases puede apoyarse una moral absoluta, o de la cual pueda derivar su autoridad un código moral universalmente obligatorio. tbatk allah 3lik chofi akhti wach hadak al zit li darti f al akhar daroooori El absolutista cree en los mandatos morales, cuya obediencia es obligatoria para todos los hombres, lo sepan o no, sea lo que sea que sientan, y cualquiera que sean sus costumbres. No se puede probar la negativa. Estamos acostumbrados a pensar que los principios morales de una nación son mas elevados que los de otra. Solemos comparar una civilización con otra y juzgar si el conjunto de ideas éticas es inferior o superior al nuestro. Darse sexo? masturbarse es sexo? no me cuadra eso sexo es entre dos o no... Tal comparación de los principios morales implica la existencia de un principio superior aplicable a ambas. Aunque para el relativista ético le es imposible hacer juicios respecto a los códigos morales de diferentes razas y épocas, todavía puede hacer tales juicios en relación con individuos dentro del mismo grupo, directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago que presumiblemente tienen perdiendo peso mismo código moral. Finalmente, no sólo es el relativismo ético desastroso en sus consecuencias para la teoría moral. Es igualmente desastroso para la conducta humana. Teorías Normativas en la Ética. Extractado de Shaw, W. En este capítulo discutiremos las diferentes perspectivas que rivalizan acerca de los principios éticos:. Teorías Consecuencialistas y No Consecuencialistas. En Ética, directrices aiom ca próstata 2020 chicago teorías normativas son aquellas que proponen pr

🥇 La maldición (The Grudge) 【2020】 Pelicula HD Completa serie de la película La maldición (The Grudge) tiene la distinción de ser uno de los raros ejemplos de una película comercial que tiene una habilidad con las palabras. A partir de la secuencia de apertura en la que un hombre mayor uso de las luchas impedimento en el habla de Alzheimer para explicar a su esposa moribunda el papel tradicional de la mujer "almohada bebé" en los tiempos bíblicos, a la trama de la película La maldición (The Grudge), la maldición (The Grudge) realiza una historia clásica y lo hace aún mejor. Puede ser bastante difícil encontrar un alquiler de películas en línea que no es una película en línea. Una gran parte de las películas que se ofrecen en línea están disponibles para su visualización en los cines, pero muchas personas prefieren alquilar películas en un ordenador. La maldición (The Grudge) es una de esas películas que no se puede ir mal con. Como en la película The Help, La maldición (The Grudge) se encuentra en un mundo que parece existir sólo en nuestra imaginación. En la película, una enfermera llamada Carolyn Butler (Catherine Zeta-Jones) va a dormir una noche y se encuentra en un reino donde ella es una anciana, mucho más antigua que se siente. La razón de su experiencia cercana a la muerte es desconocida, pero ella no despierta como un vampiro y se ve obligado a comenzar a alimentarse de las mujeres en las proximidades. Hay pocos personajes de la película, pero la maldición (The Grudge) se las arregla para mantener un cierto encan

Acciones de concienciación ambiental – AlmaNatura Acciones de concienciación ambiental 30/09/2014 Por Juanjo Manzano Debemos hacer una reflexión sobre lo que podemos aportar personalmente para evitar ser complices del gran desastre natural que se está produciendo sobre la tierra. Escrito por Sara Esteve; La ambición por conseguir dinero sin límites por parte del hombre ha conseguido acabar de forma irreversible con una gran parte de los recursos naturales existentes en nuestro planeta. La acción del hombre sobre la naturaleza y el Planeta, que a fin de cuentas es nuestra casa, está favoreciendo la aparición de numerosos problemas que van desde la extinción de numerosas especies hasta el cambio climático con las complicaciones que esto acarrea. Estamos hablando de un problema muy grave y que por culpa de esa avaricia, la destrucción de nuestro planeta avanza sin límites cada día que pasa. Son muchos los organismos u organizaciones medioambientales que llevan décadas avisándonos del este problema que nos acecha pero hasta hace apenas unos años la mayoría de los habitantes del planeta no les haciamos mucho caso. Para evitar toda una serie de problemas que tarde o temprano acaban afectandonos se tiene que llevar a cabo sobre la población mundial programas de concienciación sobre el medio ambiente. De esta manera evitaremos realizar tareas que a la larga acabaran perjudicandonos a nosotros y a todos los que nos rodean. Existen diferentes proyectos alrededor del mundo para llevar a cabo una concienciación medioambiental eficiente y de los cuáles podemos tomar como ejemplo para realizar proyectos similares en nuestros entornos, como por ejemplo el Proyecto ECOVIDA en la ciudad mexicana de Mexicali, que tiene como objetivo buscar planes de educación ambiental que desarrollen habitos y herramientas para la conservación del medioambiente en una comunidad. Dentro de las acciones que podemos realizar cada uno de nosotros para favorecer la conservación de nuestros entornos más cercanos encontramos las siguientes: Cada dia generamos miles de toneladas de residuos sobre toda la tierra. Especialmente las ciudades son lugares donde no son capaces de almacenar tantos residuos en sus vertederos. La transformación de los desechos que generamos en otros materiales supone un beneficio muy grande para nuestro medio ambiente ya que reduce los residuos del planeta así como los problemas medioambientales. Los materiales que se pueden reciclar son muchos, como la ropa, el papel y cartón desechable, el cristal o el plastico de envases…etc. Cada vez más se están incorporando en los diferentes municipios de España diferentes tipos de contenedores de residuos para ayudar en el reciclaje. Si utilizamos este tipo de recipientes estaremos favoreciendo la conservación del medio ambiente en nuestro entorno. Para ello sería conveniente tener en nuestra casa diferentes cubos de basura con diferentes espacios que nos permitiera cada vez que tiramos la basura introducir cada residuo en su espacio correspondiente. Este tipo de agricultura ecológica cada dia está tomando más pulso entre los agricultores ya que tiene muchos más beneficios que la huerta moderna e intensiva. El uso de este tipo de huerto permite favorecer la fertilidad de la tierra y a evitar el uso de peligrosos fertilizantes ya que este tipo de producción está destinada a un uso más saludable de la alimentación por parte del consumidor. Otro aspecto importante es que las semillas que se utilizan no han sido modificadas genéticamente y por lo tanto el resultado es la producción de alimentos muchos más sanos. Existen cooperativas de huertas ecológicas como la cooperativa BAH! de Galápagos en Guadalajara. Todos los productos ecológicos deben estar regulados por la normativa europea (Reglamento CE 2092/91) donde se establecen las normas de producción, de etiquetado así como del control que deben seguir estos productos desde su huerta hasta el consumidor. El conocimiento de la huerta ecológica está también presente en los estudios universitarios de los ingenieros agrónomos. Muchas universidades ya cuentan con sus propios huertos ecológicos donde los estudiantes pueden aprender a utilizar las herramientas más adecuadas, las semillas más favorables…etc. Es curioso pero en los últimos tiempos la creación de este tipo de huerta está siendo recomendada como terapía medicinal llamada " Terapía hortícola" y sus beneficios están siendo comprobados ya que generan entre los pacientes una mayor autoestima, genera motivación, concentración, etc. En España actualmente hay muchas personas que están compartiendo sus coches con los compañeros para ir al lugar del trabajo generalmente para ahorrar en combustible, pero ese no debería ser únicamente el objetivo de este tipo de uso. El principal objetivo que debería tenerse es el reducir las emisiones de CO2 ya que producen un alto grado de toxicidad sobre la atmósfera que nos rodea produciendo graves problemas de salud entre las personas e incluso entre la naturaleza. También existen diferentes empresas encargadas de organizar viajes a través del uso compartido del coche como por ejemplo la compañía blablacar la cuál pone en contacto a diferentes personas que tienen como objetivo viajar al mismo destino. Este tipo de actividad no sólo reduce costes del viaje sino que también ayuda a disminuir la contaminación mediambiental. Usar la bicicleta Ya hace años que en ciertos países como Holanda o Francia las personas utilizan sus bicicletas para transportarse de un lugar a otro ya sea al lugar de estudios, de empleo o incluso para realizar pequeñas compras por sus ciudades o pueblos. Esta actividad es muy beneficiosa no sólo para ahorrar en transporte, sino también para realizar ejercicio o para reducir las emisiones de CO2 que se llevarían a cabo si se utilizara el coche o incluso el transporte público. Existen municipios donde ya se están habilitando las infraestucturas necesarias para favorecer el transporte en bicicleta como son los carriles bici, la incorporación de anclajes en la vía pública como el servicio de alquiler de bicicletas. No usar ropas fabricadas con pieles Está muy de moda la utilización de prendas fabricadas con pieles animales especialmente entre la población más acomodada. Antes de realizar este tipo de compras en productos que además tienen precios muy elevados tendriamos que analizar un poco la situación. El negocio de los productos de pieles favorecen la extinción de especies como por ejemplo el zorro de las Malvinas. Este tipo de animales son matados brutalmente por la industria peletera. Los animales suelen ser capturados y manipulados genéticamente para engordarlos rápidamente y asi poder obtener la piel que después será utilizada en hacer abrigos, bolsos o zapatos. Implicate en una causa local Hace poco nos unimos a un grupo de trabajo local denominado #SalvemosArroyo que pretende desarrollar acciones que mejoren las condiciones de vida de las personas que viven en nuestro pueblo, Arroyomolinos de León. Desde el grupo se han propuesto una sería de intervenciones que creemos prioritarias para mejorar las condiciones ambientales de este rincón en la Sierra de Huelva.

La escuela Educadores por el futuro realiza y revisa acciones cada semana para coadyuvar en la mejora de nuestro medio ambiente. Pamela Arias Cabrera dice: 10/12/2018 a las 19:43 Yo opino que no hay que matar a los animales por que ellos quieren vivir y no morir y no utilizarlos como chamarras, vestidos,billeteras ,etc. Muchas personas no cuidan el ambiente por que tiran la basura, no separan la basura, etc. Utilizar menos combustible y mejor camina,ve en bicicleta,transporte colectivo,etc .Estos son unos de los ejemplos que les doy muchas gracias por ver mi comentario. Adiós 12/12/2018 a las 12:46 ¡Muchas gracias por tus comentarios Pamela! Brisiacarrillo dice: 08/05/2020 a las 02:08 Sería padre que todas las personas razonaran y que se dieran cuenta que están afectando ellos mismos, bueno nosotros mismos al planeta. 09/12/2018 a las 21:19 Excelentes acciones 10/12/2018 a las 19:32 Yo digo que no deben matar a los animales solo para prendas , chamarras, cartera, etc. por que los animales quieren vivir y no morir. Muchas personas no cuidan el ambiente tiran basura , no la separan , etc. La gente en general usa mucho combustible. Debemos caminar más, usar bicicleta, el transporte colectivo y verificar los autos. De igual manera utilizar energías renovables. gracias 13/12/2018 a las 19:10 Gracias por compartir tu comentario en nuestra comunidad. NICTE-HA POOT dice: 12/12/2018 a las 22:39 Yo opino que debemos concienciar a las personas de que la venta animal no es buena por que deja en peligro de extinción a los animales como el pájaro de rió al igual hay que tratar de reciclar y no usar tanta energía para contribuir a conservar nuestros ecosistemas al igual fomentar el cuidado de los animales y áreas verdes de México y planes de cuidado ambiental al igual fomentar la cultura del cuidado ambiental. 13/12/2018 a las 22:10 muchas personas quieren matar a los animales por el hecho de que ellos nos dan muchas cosas como, los zapatos, las carteras, vestimentas etc. cuando no debería ser así, lo ideal seria dejarlos vivir, pero ya que las personas tienen la necesidad de comer carne y usar productos de animales para aumentar su ego, por lo menos deberían darle gracias al animal por haber dado su vida y su energía para que nosotros usemos y nos alimentemos cada día, ellos merecen respeto tanto como nosotros. también deberían reciclar ya que el planeta cada día esta peor por el uso de tanto químicos, el plástico, el petroleo, los gases, smog etc, todos deberíamos procurar usar una bici mas frecuente que un auto, se que algunos les vale pero a lo que si les importa su planeta, hagan algo para salvarlo.tambien deberíamos hacer composta con los residuos orgánicos, para hacer crecer la vegetación. hay que cuidar el planeta. 14/12/2018 a las 15:02 Arlette alvarado dice: 15/12/2018 a las 2

ZETA – PAN reparte "pluris" para consolar perdedores PAN reparte "pluris" para consolar perdedores Fotos:Isaac Esquivel/ Galo Cañas/ Cynthia Andrade/Cuartoscuro.com Zoom Político Isaí Lara Bermúdez Lunes, 26 Febrero, 2018 12:00 PM En el Partido Acción Nacional, las candidaturas plurinominales al Senado de la República se pueden leer como las monedas de cambio para sostener, mediante el "Frente", al candidato presidencial Ricardo Anaya. El sábado 17 de febrero, el Consejo Nacional del PAN ratificó la lista de las candidaturas de representación proporcional al Senado de la República, definidas de facto por la dirigencia nacional y por el propio Anaya. Nombres como el de Miguel Ángel Mancera, gobernador perredista de la Ciudad de México, generaron la controversia; o bien, se usó una trampa al estatuto para que el dirigente nacional del PAN, Damián Zepeda, pidiera una licencia momentánea para separarse del cargo durante unos días y así poder quedar inscrito como candidato "pluri" al Senado. También llamó la atención la candidatura de Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas, otro de los ex aspirantes del PAN a la candidatura presidencial y que desistió de competir contra Anaya -hoy se sabe- a cambio de la candidatura a favor de su esposa Martha Erika Alonso a la gubernatura de Puebla (en donde Moreno Valle fue gobernador) y otra más al Senado para él. La lista la encabezó Josefina Vázquez Mota, al igual que Felipe Bravo Mena, los cuales han sido consecutivamente los candidatos perdedores a la gubernatura del PAN en el Estado de México. Ese proceso de selección y de ratificación en el PAN caminó con tumbos e inclemencias, exhibiendo nuevamente los desconciertos que genera el manejo de la política interna de Ricardo Anaya. Varios panistas se opusieron a la lista, acusaron de "fraude" y "soberbia", palabras usadas por el propio gobernador de Chihuahua, Javier Corral. Gustavo Madero, ex dirigente nacional, anunció que impugnará la lista para dar reversa a la ilegalidad de la misma. El fraude de Anaya Javier Corral fue una de las voces que más se escucharon el sábado 17. En uno de los debates tomó la palabra: "no quiero ser parte de un proceso de simulación política. No quiero ser parte de la responsabilidad que este hecho tendrá en el futuro de México y del PAN, porque lo que ha pasado, me parece que es un exceso de parte de un reducido grupo de no más de cinco personas que está tomando las decisiones de la campaña y del partido". Corral señaló que ese grupo se apoderó de los espacios de manera ilegal: "no es cierto, las leguleyadas que aquí se han dicho. Es un proceso de fraude a la ley que se planeó, que se organizó, se orientó y se ejecutó para tener la lista más reducida de candidatos al Consejo Nac

Alonso 22 de abril de 2021 Sin comentarios La electricidad, es una forma de energía que debe controlarse a través de un monitoreo que sea seguro y eficaz. Se trata de toda una exploración que se inicia a través del cableado oculto en las paredes y techos, avanza hacia los enchufes, interruptores y luminarias, hasta llegar a la unidad de consumo.

La Reforma Educativa "ya chupó faros", promete el Presidente a los maestros desde la Huasteca – Por Esto! La Reforma Educativa "ya chupó faros", promete el Presidente a los maestros desde la Huasteca El Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador encabezó hoy en Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosí, la entrega de apoyos del Programa Integral de Bienestar de su administración, desde ahí le aseguró al sector docente que se cancelará la Reforma Educativa del ex Presidente Enrique Peña Nieto. "Por el bien de todos, primero los pobres", repitió hoy el Presiente. Foto: Gobierno de México. Ciudad de México, 31 de marzo (SinEmbargo).– El Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador prometió a los maestros, desde la Huasteca Potosina donde realiza una gira, que "la mal llamada Reforma Educativa ya chupó faros". El mandatario se dirigió a las y los docentes, les dijo "estamos cumpliendo", y continuó: "Está por cancelarse la Reforma Educativa, eso ya chupó faros". López Obrador acudió hoy al Centro Cultural de la Huasteca Potosina, en Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosí, a donde acudió para entregar apoyos de los Programas Integrales de Bienestar. Desde ahí refrendó su compromiso con las promesas de campaña. El viernes pasado el líder del Ejecutivo y el Secretario de Educación, Esteban Moctezuma Barragán, expusieron esta mañana las diferencias entre la Reforma Educativa y la reforma que busca eliminarla. El mandatario federal aseguró que buscan informar con las bases del magisterio, pues los líderes tienen sus propios intereses y no siempre actúan con principios democráticos. Indicó que los dirigentes tienen sus propios intereses y no siempre actúan con principios democráticos, pero dijo que "ya no hay ciudadanos imaginarios, ahora cada ciudadano es una persona consciente, con criterio". El Jefe del Ejecutivo Federal ofreció de nueva cuenta a los maestros dialogo y reiteró que no habrá "nada de represión". López Obrador defendió esta mañana desde San Luis Potosí los cambios que plantea su Gobierno: "No llegamos a la presidencia después de haber luchado tanto tiempo para hacer lo mismo, no les vamos a fallar", se comprometió. El Presidente anunció que envió hoy un mensaje a Esteban Moctezuma para pedirle su apoyo con un programa de bandas de guerra en las escuelas. "Tenemos que saber todos cómo está el presupuesto, antes no se sabía, pero hoy queremos que se sepa qué le corresponde al pueblo. Decirle que vamos a llevar acciones importantes para el bienestar, porque eso es lo más importante, que ellos tengan para lo indispensable. Hay que atender a todos, pero hay que darle prioridad a los humildes", expuso. Por eso, dijo que se dará apoyo como nunca a las personas. "Ahora tenemos la fórmula: acabar con al corrupción y la impunidad". Aseguró que antes solo se repartía riqueza a los pobres en época electoral, lo que su administración terminará. "Por eso vengo a decirles que no le vamos a quedar a deber nada al pueblo de México", dijo. "Son muchos los pendiente y retomando una frase de Madero, el pueblo de México está sediento de justicia" Festejó que el apoyo a adultos mayores sea de más de 2 mil 550 pesos, las personas indígenas lo reciben desde que tienen 65 años y en otros lugares del país desde los 68. Recordó que se realiza un censo para identificar a las y los adultos mayores y a las personas con discapacidad, así como con las personas jóvenes. "No pasar el dinero por el gobierno, ese fue un consejo que me dieron mis asesores, los adultos mayores, a los que escucho siempre, me dijeron, no entregues el dinero a través del Gobierno, por eso desde la tesorería bajará el dinero a quien lo necesite. Dijo que solo en Ciudad Valles hay 6 mil 021 estudiantes de nivel medio superior recibirán una beca de mil 600 pesos cada dos meses y serán 869 becas para estudiantes de universidades. Defendió la creación del programa jóvenes construyendo el futuro, donde se les pasará a los jóvenes mientras se les capacita como aprendices. Dijo que no hay limites para solicitantes porque se tienen contemplados 44 mil millones de pesos para dicho programa. Dijo que la pobreza se desató porque se abandonó al campo y los jóvenes, que la violencia no se enfrentará con más violencia. Aseguró que las cosas cambiarán con bienestar para el pueblo, garantizando qu

Crecerá la construcción en 2020 En 2019 cayó un 9 por ciento el valor de la construcción en San Luis Potosí y se espera que para 2020 apenas haya un crecimiento del 1.5 por ciento, es decir, que este sector se recuperará parcialmente, pero se mantendrá por debajo de las cifras que presentó antes de 2019, reconoció Manuel Antonio Castanedo de Alba, presidente de la Cámara Mexicana de la Industria de la Construcción (CMIC). El empresario dijo que este año se avecinan obras públicas en materia de movilidad, derivadas del convenio que signaron Gobierno del Estado y el ayuntamiento de San Luis Potosí, como es la ampliación del Puente Pemex. También se efectuarán obras sobre el Periférico, como es el puente vehicular y un brazo para conectar Río Españita con Salvador Nava. Entre las 12 obras de movilidad también está la construcción de un paso superior vehicular en calle 71 y un brazo de incorporación en Carretera 57 con calle Tláloc, además de un incremento de la capacidad de la planta potabilizadora Los Filtros; mientras que en el Eje 140 se llevarán a cabo trabajos de mejoramiento del lado sur, desde avenida CFE hasta las vías del ferrocarril. Los proyectos iniciarán a partir de marzo. Antonio Castanedo previó q

La terapia de aceptación y compromiso - Psicoterapeutas Home La terapia de aceptación y compromiso En esta página se presenta la terapia de aceptación y compromiso como una avance de la terapia cognitivo conductual basándose en la teoría de los marcos relacionales y señala que existen dificultades en adaptar la práctica de esta terapia para los psicólogos cognitivo conductuales tradicionales. La terapia de aceptación y compromiso: No hay una buena práctica sin una buena teoría Además de la formación totalmente orientada a la práctica que se presenta en Psicoterapeutas.com, en el aspecto teórico se hace especial hincapié en laTerapia de Aceptación y Compromiso que recoge los últimos avances dentro del paradigma Cognitivo conductual. Se ha demostrado que el aprendizaje de la terapia de aceptación y compromiso cambia la forma de operar del psicólogo y aumenta su eficacia y la satisfacción del paciente. Por ejemplo, es el encuadre más eficaz para los tratamientos en los que se utiliza la exposición (trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, agorafobia, fobias, fobia social, depresión, etc.). La terapia de aceptación y compromiso (ACT) (Hayes, Stroshal y Wilson, 1999; Wilson y Luciano, 2002) se presenta a sí misma una terapia cognitivo conductual, y se reclama como una evolución natural del análisis de la conducta, debido a un desarrollo teórico importante: la teoría de los marcos relacionales. Esta teoría pretende dar cuenta de la adquisición y funcionalidad del lenguaje, permitiendo incorporar el lenguaje, el pensamiento y la cognición a la terapia más conductual y emplear técnicas dentro de la más pura tradición del análisis de la conducta para su modificación. ACT es su aplicación práctica a la psicología clínica y puede afrontar con eficacia aspectos que antes estaban reservados a la terapia cognitiva, además permite incorporar al quehacer terapéutico temas que hasta ahora han sido marginales o ignorados en la terapia cognitivo conductual, como el concepto de YO, vivir aquí y ahora, la atención plena, etc. Desde el punto de vista del análisis funcional ACT es un desarrollo lógico y plenamente integrado y los psicólogos que se encuadran en esa línea, si bien no tendrán muchas dificultades teóricas en incorporarla, pueden tener problema de índole práctica porque para emplear el modelo ACT es necesaria una profunda reconversión de técnicas totalmente consolidadas. Por poner un ejemplo, una técnica tan potente y establecida como la exposición ha de sufrir grandes trasformaciones. Generalmente, el objetivo para el que se utiliza la exposición en la práctica clínica es conseguir la disminución o eliminación de la ansiedad. ACT plantea un objetivo distinto: conseguir que el paciente amplíe su repertorio conductual recortado por el condicionamiento aversivo. El objetivo no es extinguir la ansiedad, sino conseguir que el paciente avance en cualquier situación en la dirección de sus valores. Por eso, la alternativa ACT a la exposición es la aceptación. Aceptar plenamente algo supone vivir con ello sin querer cambiarlo, sin hacer nada par

El hackeo a Ashley Madison descubre a 37 millones de adúlteros | Informe21.com Los hackers amenazan con publicar la información de los usuarios así como la de sus empleados. El ataque viene tras la publicación de que si los usuarios pagaban 19 dólares se haría un borrado completo de la información que de ellos había. Al no haberse realizado lo que prometían, el grupo ha decidido actuar. Del mismo modo, los hackers han asegurado que "vamos a liberar a todos los registros de clientes, incluyendo los perfiles con fantasías sexuales secretas de todos los clientes a los que emparejarán las transacciones de tarjetas de crédito, nombres, direcciones reales, así como los documentos de los empleados y correos electrónicos de la empresa". El grupo ha chantajeado a la empresa para que retire estos servicios, y ya han filtrando parte de misma. De los datos filtrados hasta el momento se puede sacar información sobre salarios y cuentas bancarias, detalles sobre la estructura de los servicios internos así como datos de miembros de la web. Este suceso no sólo afecta a los estadounidenses y canadienses, de donde son la mayoría de los usuarios, sino que también afec

▷Mejoras para el sector minero argentino - El Economista Mejoras para el sector minero argentino Un informe de la Secretaría de Minería, ahora en manos de Carolina Sánchez, destacó las mejoras en la actividad en los últimos años. El relevamiento realizado por la Subsecretaría de Desarrollo Minero resaltó que "uno de los mayores indicadores de crecimiento en la actividad es el número de perforaciones realizadas en materia exploratoria", que en el período 2015-18 se concentró principalmente en la búsqueda de oro, uranio, cobre y litio. Con respecto a las perforaciones, el informe resaltó que las efectuadas por las compañías del sector pasó de 244 en 2015 a 1.000 el año pasado, lo cual representó un salto de 310%. En el caso del oro, las tareas de perforación crecieron 2.200% y permitieron "extender la vida útil de las operaciones mineras e incrementar los recursos en proyectos avanzados", explicó el informe. Sobre el millar de perforaciones mineras totales desarrolladas en 2018, las orientadas a futuros hallazgos de vetas auríferas fueron 459, frente a las 206 del año anterior y apenas 20 durante 2015. Por su parte, las perforaciones en búsqueda de uranio se inc

Jueves 27 de Febrero del 2020 Staff Felicita administrador de la Ciudad a nombre del Alcalde a la Generación 2019 de la FCPYS Ciudad Juárez cuenta ya con otros 116 profesionistas que a partir de hoy contribuirán con su desempeño laboral en el crecimiento de nuestra comunidad, afirmó esta tarde el administrador de la Ciudad, José Rodolfo Martínez Ortega. Lo anterior al acudir en representación del Presidente Municipal Armando Cabada Alvídrez a la graduación de los ya profesionistas Generación 2019, de la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales de la Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua, Campus Juárez. Al iniciar su intervención, el administrador pidió un fuerte aplauso para honrar a las familias que siempre los apoyaron hasta alcanzar su meta. Martínez Ortega destacó el papel de la UACH que durante décadas ha sido formadora de generaciones de hombres y mujeres comprometidos con su profesión, enalteciendo el nombre de la máxima casa de estudios del estado a nivel nacional e internacional. Es importante seguirse preparando porque esa es la clave para enfrentar los cambios, para ser ciudadanos libres y empoderados que puedan contribuir en la sociedad, indicó. Les recordó que en el diccionario siempre la palabra disciplina viene antes que la de éxito, por eso los invitó a que no se rindan porque les espera una larga vida. En total, fueron 96 alumnos de licenciatura en las carreras de Ciencias de la Comunicación, Administración y Relaciones Internacionales, así como 20 de maestría en Administración Pública, Administración y Comunicación, quienes con la conclusión de sus estudios se comprometen también para aportar con los conocimientos adquiridos a mejorar su entorno, destacó. El discurso en representación de la generación correspondió a Sheira Sugey Hernández Candelario, quién agradeció a las familias de los estudiantes, a los profesores y los invito a ser factores de cambio en los nuevos retos que habrán de enfrentar en la vida profesional. Estuvieron en el presidium Abraham Paniagua Vázquez, director de la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales, de la Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua campus Juárez; el Capitán Primero Quimoteo Vázquez Trejo, en representación del General Brigadier DEM, Ernesto Joaquín Geminiano Jiménez, comandante de la Guarnición Militar de la Plaza; Marte Rodolfo Ol

Conectar Igualdad: más social y cultural que educativo - Marcha - Una mirada popular de la Argentina y el mundo Conectar Igualdad: más social y cultural que educativo Educación Miércoles, 01 Agosto 2012 00:05 Tweet Maximiliano Duquelsky, un investigador de la UBA que estudia la relación entre comunicación y educación, conversó con Marcha acerca de uno de los programas más ambiciosos del Estado nacional.. - ¿Cómo analizás el programa "Conectar Igualdad"? ¿Se lo puede caracterizar como una política educativa, una política social o una política cultural? ¿O es una mezcla de las tres? Comienzo por afirmar mi acuerdo con que se distribuyan netbooks entre la población que no puede acceder a esta tecnología por motivos económicos, pero resaltar continuamente esta acción como el aspecto principal de una política educativa ya es otra cuestión. Si tuviera que definir el programa Conectar Igualdad (CI) con una fórmula, diría que tiene mucho más de política social y cultural, que de política educativa. No es la primera vez que se intenta en Argentina o en Latinoamérica encarar la solución de problemáticas educativas, sociales o culturales mediante acciones de modernización tecnológica. Diría entonces que CI posee varias características de una política social tendiente a disminuir el impacto de las desigualdades económicas en el ejercicio de un derecho. Me refiero al acceso a las nuevas tecnologías y al mundo virtual y digital, mediante una acción del Estado. Por supuesto, no es posible llevar adelante una política educativa en este terreno sin una infraestructura acorde. Pero cuando uno ingresa al portal del programa puede comprobar inmediatamente que el discurso está claramente sostenido sobre las cifras de netbooks entregadas, como si fueran cantidades de calles asfaltadas o casas con cloacas. Esto genera, en el corto plazo, un enorme impacto positivo para el Gobierno y el Estado en el plano simbólico como consecuencia del imaginario tecnológico que atraviesa nuestra era y hace que veamos la modernización como positiva en sí misma, dificultando reflexionar sobre cuestiones efectivamente educativas. Estos elementos y objetivos son propios de una política cultural. Si a estas características le sumamos que los jóvenes deben contar con las competencias necesarias para aprovechar esta "facilidad" en el acceso a un aparato cultural de dimensiones nunca antes visto en la historia, podemos afirmar que esta democratización en el acceso se topa con el mismo obstáculo que cualquier política cultural separada de lo educativo: la necesidad de formar a los sujetos en las competencias necesarias para aprovechar los bienes culturales -la netbook es una bien cultural también- que se difunden gratuitamente. Todas estas acciones de parte de un gobierno pueden ser comprensibles y hasta esperables. Pero como estamos analizando este programa en tanto política educativa, podemos señalar que o no es una política educativa, o es una con muchas deficiencias. Una política educativa debería haber comenzado, por ejemplo, por entregarle las netbooks a los docentes, diseñado un plan de capacitación en servicio que los preparara para utilizar estas herramientas de manera correcta y cuando lo consideraran necesario. En cambio, empezaron por los alumnos -o a lo sumo por ambos al mismo tiempo-, quienes seguramente continuaron utilizándolas como lo venían haciendo o como veían que las usaban los que sí tenían computadora, reforzando usos socialmente consagrados; y luego las llevaron a la escuela, con esos usos reforzados, cuando todavía el docente no sabía bien qué hacer con ellas. - ¿Cuáles son las principales mejoras y las principales dificultades de los docentes para llevar a cabo la enseñanza de distintas materias a través del uso de esta nueva herramienta? Los testimonios de los docentes, por lo menos los que yo recojo en mi práctica educativa, son elocuentes. Hacen referencia a la necesidad de capacitarse, a que les han agregado una dificultad más ya que los alumnos tenían las netbooks pero ellos no sabían muy bien para qué y cómo había que usarlas; también suelen señalar los usos que los estudiantes realizan de las máquinas en el aula. Vinculado con esto, hay un aspecto que pocas veces se aborda. Me refiero a la necesidad de precisar de qué competencias estamos hablando cuando decimos que los niños y los jóvenes están mejor preparados para este mundo digital, o que la escuela debe adaptarse a los nuevos tiempos; tampoco qué debe hacer la escuela con esas competencias.¿Debe reproducirlas, promoverlas o modificarlas? Hay competencias que pueden ser favorables para aprender aquello que la escuela cree necesario enseñar. Pero también hay competencias digitales que pueden obturar ese aprendizaje. Bajo la excusa de que estaríamos atravesando una revolución cultural, y por temor a quedar atrapados en discursos supuestamente anacrónicos, la interrogación sobre las competencias que se adquieren mediante el uso doméstico de las nuevas tecnologías y su relación con las competencias que debe brindar la escuela, queda fuera del "orden del día", cuando en realidad creo que se trata de una pregunta central de todo proyecto educativo. En cuanto a las mejoras, la gran cantidad de información disponible y la facilidad para acceder a ella es algo innegable. Igual que las posibilidades que permiten la digitalización de la producción cultural de los estudiantes. Que eso se traduzca en mejoras en el aprendizaje es algo muy distinto. O que todos los contenidos deban ser enseñados utilizando las nuevas tecnologías. - ¿Se puede hablar de una revolución en el terreno educativo-cultural a partir del impulso y desarrollo del programa? Si es así, ¿por qué? Cada vez que apareció una nueva tecnología con posibilidades de aplicación educativa surgió la pregunta de si estábamos ante la posibilidad de una revolución en la enseñanza escolar, como parte de una revolución en el plano cultural. En caso de poder darse una revolución educativo-cultural por fuera de una transformación social, incluso en ese caso, sería muy cauto en afirmar algo semejante acerca de éste o de cualquier programa similar. Las tecnologías por sí mismas no generan un cambio social o cultural. Detrás de un planteo atractivo, como es hablar de "una revolución educativo-cultural" en ciernes, puede esconderse una política totalmente opuesta. Recordemos que la Ley Federal de Educación levantaba las banderas de la descentralización, cuyo objetivo, supuestamente, era democratizar el sistema educativo argentino respetando las particularidades de cada región, por ejemplo. El resultado concreto fue la destrucción del sistema educativo argentino. Entonces, en principio, dudo que estemos en presencia de una revolución educativo-cultural progresiva. Creo sí que estamos ante un discurso que pretende legitimarse detrás de un proceso de cambio cultural, pero que en realidad tiene por objetivo subordinar la escuela pública a la lógica cultural que hoy impulsan las grandes corporaciones tecnológicas, que son privadas. - ¿Argentina podría aprender de la experiencia de otros países o los otros países deberían aprender de la experiencia argentina? Acabo de estar en Uruguay dando una charla organizada por el Plan Ceibal. Este programa tiene unos cuantos años más de implementación que CI. Los docentes que concurrieron expresaron las mismas preocupaciones y dudas que tienen nuestros docentes sobre la integración de las nuevas tecnologías en la educación. El problema de estos programas radica en que están condicionados por las necesidades políticas de los gobiernos de turno. Los estudios realizados hasta ahora no muestran resultados pedagógicos relevantes. Un resultado pedagógico relevante sería comprobar que los alumnos aprenden mejor utilizando nuevas tecnologías.

Hace muchos años, las zapatillas eran uno de esos elementos que podíamos incorporar a nuestros outfits solo cuando fuéramos más de sport. Ya fuera en fines de semana, festivos o cualquier otro día en los que fuéramos a realizar una actividad que no era habitual en nuestro día a día. El paso de los años, el peso de la comodidad, la renovación estética y su transversalidad con el ámbito de la moda, ha hecho que la industria del calzado deportivo haya conseguido llegar a un tipo de público que jamás se hubiera podido prever. Solamente tenemos que ver algunas de las principales semanas de la moda del mundo para observar el cada vez mayor peso que esta industria está teniendo. Las zapatillas han conseguido inmiscuirse en nuestras vidas hasta romper la estética clásica de traje y zapatos que antes nos encontrábamos en las oficinas, en pro de looks mucho más informales, en las que nuestras sneakers centran toda la atención. Y está permitido llevarla de todos los colores posibles. Y ahora, con la llegada del verano, su protagonismo es todavía mayor. Los meses de verano son el momento perfecto para que saquemos a relucir algunas de nuestras mejores siluetas. Siempre teniendo especial atención al evento que vamos, desde festivales de música hasta excursiones en la montaña, es conveniente escoger la que mejor se adapta al evento que tenemos previsto. Y eso, dado la cantidad las opciones que existen en el mercado, no será fácil. Por eso os proponemos cinco siluetas con las que pasar un verano con un par de zapatillas con las que podréis iros de vacaciones, o a la oficina, sin perder un ápice de comodidad. Índice adidas Deerupt Nike Zoom Fly SP adidas Primeknit adidas UltraBoost Nike Flyknit Nike VaporMax Flyknit Nike Epic React Flyknit adidas Deerupt Adidas irrumpía con fuerza en los meses previos al verano, presentándonos una de sus siluetas estrella de los últimos meses, las nuevas zapatillas adidas Deerupt. Una zapatilla con una parte superior completamente transpirable gracias a la malla que incorpora. Nike Zoom Fly SP Su principal competidor, la firma con sede en Oregon, Nike, no se quedaba atrás a la hora de lanzar al mercado zapatillas con la tecnología suficiente como para poder utilizarlas en verano. Y, bajo esas condiciones, por medio de la Nike Zoom Fly SP, los de Portland han hecho lo posible para hacer que sea una de las zapatillas preferidas para el verano. Pero si tenemos que hablar de alguna tecnología para utilizarla en nu

San Javier, La Municipalidad Aportó al Hospital Rawson Más de $2 Millones para el Quirófano – Vecinos de la Costa by Redaccion VC 24 julio, 2021 23 julio, 2021 098 Informan desde el Municipio de la Ciudad de San Javier que el mismo hizo un aporte de casi 2.000.000 de pesos al quirófano del hospital "Guillermo Rawson". Los mismos se concretaron mediante diferentes recursos, fundamentalmente con los "Fondos COVID" recibidos por el gobierno de la ciudad de San Javier, por parte del Gobierno de la Provincia de Santa Fe. Según lo informado por parte del municipio de San Javier se realizaron importantes aportes al sistema de salud pública de nuestra localidad, que alcanzarían a casi $2 Millones, y agregan que como es de público conocimiento, desde la Municipalidad hay un permanente acompañamiento de la Secretaría de Obras y Servicios Públicos en la obra de refuncionalización del Hospital Rawson, como así también desde Acción Social, con diversas gestiones. En esta oportunidad se suman las inversiones para el quirófano, tanto para la compra de materiales y equipar la torre laparoscópica, como para la camilla especial de cirugías.

Vuelven las clases presenciales en CABA - Sobreviviendo FM Tras once meses alejados de las escuelas, los alumnos del CABA regresan hoy, miércoles 17 de febrero a las aulas de manera presencial. Con un protocolo estricto y de manera "escalonada y progresiva" para reducir el riesgo de contagios de coronavirus. Las clases antes de la pandemia "Hoy, miércoles comienzan las clases en esta nueva normalidad, buscando garantizar que todos los chicas vayan a la escuela", sostuvo la ministra de Educación porteña, Soledad Acuña. Asimismo, Acuña remarcó que durante la permanencia en los establecimientos educativos los niños "deben tener el barbijo puesto para cada actividad", a la vez que subrayó que también apuntan a "evitar que haya mucha gente esperando para salir o entrar". El inicio del ciclo lectivo 2021 Por su parte, el ministro de Educación de la Nación, Nicolás Trotta, explicó que habrá una "reorganización pedagógica" y "se va a comenzar por lo pendiente (de 2020) y lo proyectado" para 2021, así como record

Aviación Comercial Mundial Swiss introducirá a partir de mayo alimentos y bebidas sin gluten ni lactosa para alérgicos Swiss International Air Lines introducirá a partir del próximo mes de mayo una serie de productos que están diseñados específicamente para mejorar el vuelo de las personas alérgicas. Estas innovaciones consisten en alimentos y bebidas sin gluten y lactosa, junto con otros cambios en el interior de la cabina. Swiss se ha asociado con el Centro Europeo de Investigación de la Alergia (ECARF) para ofrecer a sus clientes productos más personalizado, que están orientados a los viajeros con alergias. De forma que los alérgicos podrán tomar crema de café libre de lactosa, además de la popular barrita de chocolate, también libre de lactosa. Dependiendo de la duración del vuelo, los pasajeros con alergias o intolerancias pueden solicitar mediante pago bocadillos especiales, yogur o pasteles sin lactosa o gluten. Asimismo, los pasajeros de vuelos de larga distancia y los de la clase de negocios dentro de Europa podrán solicitar con 24 horas de antelación al vuelo que se les sirvan comidas especiales adaptadas a sus necesidades. Por otra parte, Swiss está realizando modificaciones en los asientos de clase First y Business para que los pasajeros dispongan de almohadas rellenas con materiales sintéticos como alternativa a la versión de plumón. Swiss también está eliminando de la cabina el uso de flores decorativas y ambientadores que pueden causar irritaciones de nariz y garganta. Por último, en los lavabos introducirá jabones que son particularmente suaves en la piel . «El número de personas que sufren de alergias han aumentado en todo el mundo industrializado en los últimos años», comentó el profesor Torsten Zuberbier, director de la ECARF, que tiene su sede en Berlín. «Más del 30% de la población de Europa padece una o más alergias, por no hablar de los afectados indirectamente, como sus familias. Sin embargo, sólo alrededor de un 10% de los pacientes recibe el tratamiento médico adecuado y las alergias con frecuencia no se toman en serio, incluso por los propios enfermos». 23/04/2014, 09:33 Delta Air Lines ha completado la instalación de los asientos cama completamente planos con acceso directo al pasillo en BusinessElite en toda su flota de fuselaje ancho internacional, convirtiéndose en la única compañía aérea de los EE.UU. en ofrecer este tipo de asientos y la conveniencia del acceso directo desde el pasillo en todos los vuelos transoceánicos. -el lanzamiento del servicio internacional de Wi-Fi y completó la instalación de Wi-Fi en todos los vuelos domésticos de doble clase y en los jets regionales, ofreciendo este servicio a más de 400.000 clientes por día, por encima de los 10.000 pies en más de 870 aviones. -la transformación de la experiencia de dormir en el aire al ofrecer ropa de cama Westin Heavenly In-Flight para clientes en la cabina BusinessElite. -la actualización del kit de amenidades para BusinessElite con elegantes estuches de Tumi y la marca de productos para el cuidado de la piel Malin + Goetz. -la conformación de un equipo de chefs celebrados y reconocidos con el Premio James Beard para ofrecer a los clientes excelentes comidas y vinos seleccionados a 30.000 pies de altura. -la introducción de un kit para dormir en clase Turista internacional y el agregado de amenidades para los clientes de clase Turista en vuelos transoceánicos y a Sudamérica. Delta ha invertido miles de millones de dólares en la experiencia del cliente, incluyendo la actualización de los interiores con más espacio para equipaje y acceso a fuente para recarga eléctrica a lo largo de 225 aviones de fuselaje angosto hasta el año 2016, una nueva Terminal 4 en el JFK de New York y la terminal internacional Maynard H. Jackson Jr. en Atlanta. Delta también ha gastado más de $ 100 millones para ampliar, renovar y consolidar las Terminales C y D en el aeropuerto de LaGuardia de Nueva York, abrió sus Sky Deck en los Delta Sky Clubs de JFK-Nueva York y Atlanta en el 2013. Además, los clientes han visto la inversión de Delta en sus más de 50 Delta Sky Clubs en todo el sistema, las fuentes para recarga eléctrica en decenas de aeropuertos, las continuas actualizaciones de la aplicación Fly Delta, incluyendo características tales como seguimiento de equipaje y registro desde el dispositivo móvil. FLY NEWS - por Esther Apesteguía — 24 Abril, 2014 Iberia había abandonado la ruta Madrid Montevideo el 1 de abril de 2013. Nº Vuelo Ruta Días de operación Salida Llegada IB6011 Madrid-Montevideo Lunes, martes, jueves y sábado 00:30 07:50 IB6012 Montevideo- Madrid Lunes, martes, jueves y sábado 13:30 06:20 del día siguiente Japan Airlines es la aerolínea más puntual del mundo y LAN, la segunda de la región En las salidas y llegadas en 2013, según la consultora internacional Flightstats. Esta es la primera vez que se incluye al cono sur. Aunque los ingleses deberían ser los primeros, la línea aérea más puntual del año 2013 fue japonesa. Con el 93,11% de sus despegues a tiempo, y el 88,94% de sus llegadas justo a la hora, Japan Airlines obtuvo —por cuarta vez consecutiva— el primer lugar del ranking On-Time Performance Service 2013, elaborado en todo el mundo por la consultora internacional Flightstats. Un poco más abajo, en la categoría de las mayores líneas aéreas del mundo, está la holandesa KLM, que para este análisis es considerada como una línea separada de Air France, con quien fusionó sus operaciones en 2003. Según en informe, la Royal Dutch despegó a la hora el 85,57% de sus más de 127 mil vuelos contabilizados, y aterrizó puntual el 88,03% de las veces. En tercer lugar hay otra asiática, la All Nippon Airways. También conocida como Zennikku o ANA, esta línea aérea con sede en Tokio promedió una puntualidad de 89,18% en sus vuelos a lo largo del planeta. Más atrás están Iberia, ScandinavianAirlines System, Saudi Arabian Airlines y Delta Air Lines. El informe, que no solo calcula los promedios de despegue y aterrizaje, sino que además contabiliza otros criterios, divide a las líneas aéreas según zona geográfica de operación. En Norteamérica la más puntual es Alaska Airlines, con un 90,96% de puntualidad en las salidas. La siguen las estadounidenses Delta, US Airways, AirTrain, United Airlines y American Airlines. En Europa a KLM, Iberia y SAS las siguen Lufthansa, Aeroflot y Alitalia. De Panamá hasta Colombia En contabilización de nuestra región (que incluye al Caribe y a Centro y Sudamérica), la línea más puntual es la panameña Copa Airlines, que sumó un 93,24% de sus despegues a tiempo y un 89,83% de sus aterrizajes justo a la hora. Esta es la primera vez que se incluye en la muestra a las mayores aerolíneas de la región. En el segundo lugar de la muestra está la chilena LAN, cuyos vuelos se contabilizaron por separado con TAM, que ocupa el quinto lugar del ranking en la región. Según Flightstats, en 2013 el 87,19% de los vuelos de LAN despegaron a la hora, y el 85,55% llegaron a tiempo, una performance que superó a Gol, Azul TAM, Aerolíneas Argentinas y la colombiana Avianca.

Turkish Airlines: la aerolínea que quiere conquistar Asia | www.capital.es 06/05/2014, 11:15 "Uno de los aspectos de la aviación que generalmente se pasa por alto es el referente a los beneficios que trae a la sociedad y la economía en general", subrayó. De los 58,1 millones de empleos que garantiza el sector, 8,7 millones están dentro de la propia industria: empleos en aerolíneas, en aeropuertos y en la industria aeronáutica. Los proveedores de esas compañías garantizan otros diez millones de puestos de trabajo en servicios como el catering, el suministro de combustible, finanzas y componentes para la aeronáutica. El informe estima que los salarios de estos empleos directos e indirectos generan una cifra de alrededor de 4,6 millones de empleos en la economía general. Los autores del reporte de ATAG señalan que, con base en las actuales tasas de crecimiento y las tendencias de la industria, esta garantizará 103 millones de empleos y aportará 5,8 billones de dólares dentro de 20 años. Ello dependerá, según explicó Gill, de cuánto apoyo recibe el sector. "El transporte aéreo está creciendo rápidamente, particularmente en Asia-Pacífico, América Latina y Oriente Medio, en economías en expansión y con clases medias emergentes que sacan provecho de los beneficios de los viajes aéreos. Sin embargo, a nivel global, el análisis indica que incluso un crecimiento de la aviación a una tasa 1% menor podría reducir en 12,4 millones el conteo de empleos previstos para 2032". "El crecimiento debe ser concebido de una forma más holística, combinando los factores económicos, sociales y ambientales. Por ejemplo, la buena planificación de infraestructuras puede hacer la diferencia 20 años después. La asociación entre los sectores público y privado es clave si las economías de 2030 desean explotar al máximo los beneficios de la aviación", concluyó. http://www.caribbeannewsdigital.com/...ento-economico 08/05/2014, 10:23 Etihad se inventa una nueva primera clase en sus A380 La aerolínea de Emiratos Árabes Etihad ha dado el do de pecho en la configuración interior de su nuevo A380, que recibirá a finales de este año. La compañía se inventa una primera superior, a la que ha llamado Residence, y que incluye incluso un baño privado en cada una de las suites que componen esta cabina. Una experiencia similar a la de volar en un avión privado, con la diferencia de que te acompañan casi 500 personas. Cómo no podía ser de otra manera, ha sido una aerolínea de Oriente Medio, Etihad, la que ha dado un salto cualitativo en lo que todos conocemos, aunque sea de oídas, por una primera clase. La aerolínea de Emiratos se inventa una primera superior, a la que ha bautizado como Residence, que pretende transmitir la experiencia de un vuelo en jet privado, con la única salvedad de que en el mismo avión viajan otras 498 personas, eso sí, en categorías distintas. Todo indica que la aerolínea ha hecho un auténtico esfuerzo para diferenciarse en el servicio de un avión, que aunque sigue siendo un referente en el transporte aéreo, ya lleva siete años operando con las aerolíneas más punteras del mundo. Así, donde se ha dado el do de pecho es con esta cuarta clase, que casi podemos decir que es un avión privado a bordo del A380. Se trata de una única cabina, que pude ser ocupada por uno o dos viajeros, con 11,6 metros cuadrados, y que cuenta con tres habitaciones: los asientos "normales", un cuarto de baño privado con ducha (sesiones de 4 minutos de agua); y un dormitorio. Los dos asientos, un sofá para la aerolínea, tienen 1,53 metros de ancho. El monitor de televisión es de 32 pulgadas. Los otros servicios son similares a los de primera clase: otomán con cajones para objetos personales, nevera, puertas… El dormitorio, situado en la parte delantera de la cabina, separado de los asientos por el baño, cuenta con una cama doble de 2,08 metros de largo y 1,20 m de ancho, con espacio de almacenamiento debajo de esta, mesa auxiliar, distintos tipos de luces auxiliares; un monitor de TV de 27 pulgadas y armario. Se incluye un servicio personal de mayordomo, posibilidad de menús a la carta y traslados a y desde el aeropuerto en limusina. Todo ello, eso sí, a un precio: 15.200 euros para un vuelo Abu Dhabi-Londres (sólo ida), que es la primera ruta en la que el A380 de Etihad operará desde diciembre de 2014. Además de ese primer ejemplar, Etihad recibirá otros cuatro A380 en 2015, tres en 2016 y dos en 2017. El segundo ejemplar reforzará los vuelos a Londres, que será finalmente el primer destino del avión desde Abu Dhabi. A lo largo de 2015, según lleguen los aviones previstos para ese año Sydney y Nueva York también serán servidas con el A380. BOEING 787 TAMBIÉN A FINAL DE AÑO Otro de los nuevos aviones que incorporará la aerolínea a lo largo de este año será els Boeing 787. El primero de ellos entrará en servicio en diciembre de 2014 entre Abu Dhabi y Dusseldorf, seguido de Washington y Mumbai en enero de 2015. Son 71 los B-787 pedidos por Etihad -41 B-787-9 y 30 B-787-10-, de los que dos llegarán antes de que finalice 2014, 3 en 2015, tres en 2016 y nueve en 2017. El resto legarán hasta el año 2023. La configuración interna a la que hemos hecho referencia en el texto por ahora sólo ha sido confirmada por la aerolínea para las cinco primeras unidades que recibirá. 09/05/2014, 08:04 Air France también apuesta por una primera superior A

Sanz afirma que ANV no tenía que haber estado en los ayuntamientos y considera "acertado" que se adopten medidas | Últimas noticias de la actualidad cultural en Diario de Navarra Sanz afirma que ANV no tenía que haber estado en los ayuntamientos y considera "acertado" que se adopten medidas El jefe del Ejecutivo foral propuso que se planteen mociones de censura "tras acuerdos adoptados por los partidos democráticos allá donde se pueda" Actualizada Viernes, 5 de diciembre de 2008 - 12:22 h. El presidente del Gobierno de Navarra, Miguel Sanz, afirmó hoy que ANV no tenía que haber estado en los ayuntamientos y que le parece, por tanto, una medida "acertada" que se reclame la disolución de los consistorios gobernados por la formación ilegalizada. Según dijo en declaraciones a los medios de comunicación, es preciso "utilizar todos los mecanismos legales a nuestro alcance para poder apartar a ANV de las instituciones y si no existe posibilidad de hacerlo a través de la aplicación de la ley, que se haga a través de iniciativas políticas". En este sentido, propuso que se planteen mociones de censura "tras acuerdos adoptados por los partidos democráticos allá donde se pueda porque ANV no tenga mayoría absoluta" o bien se adopten otro tipo de iniciativas "para no dejarse apoyar tampoco por este partido para tomar ciertas cotas de poder". A su juicio, "es muy frecuente que a las horas de cometerse un atentado como el asesinato de Ignacio Uría todos los partidos salgan diciendo que van a rechazar a ANV, pero a los dos o tres días se han olvidado de todo". "Las iniciativas y el pensamiento y las posiciones políticas tienen que estar basadas en la coherencia", manifestó. Miguel Sanz afirmó que UPN siempre ha dicho que no apoyará ni se dejará apoyar por ANV. "Y no posibilitaremos que nadie de nuestra organización acceda a las instituciones basándose en posiciones pasivas o activas de ANV, de todos aquellos que no creen en la democracia y en las libertades", dijo. El presidente navarro se mostró además "completamente de acuerdo" con la iniciativa del PSN de pedir a Nafarroa Bai que no se apoye en ANV. "NaBai, que tiene algunos ayuntamientos gracias al apoyo de ANV, activo o pasivo, debería reconsiderar esta posición y hacerlo de la manera más rápida posible", señaló. "Incluso en algunos ayuntamientos, investidos del carácter de independientes, está ocurriendo lo mismo", dijo para recordar el caso de Sartaguda, donde el alcalde accedió al cargo con el apoyo de ANV "y después de haber apartado a UPN que fue el partido mayoritario". "Se pueden tomar iniciativas para hacerles ver a todos los alcaldes que se dicen independientes o no adscritos que no vamos a actuar de manera pasiva cuando se apoyen organizaciones como ANV para dirigir o alcanzar el poder municipal", indicó. Parece mentira como ANV se metió en los ayuntamientos previo engaño de Zapatero ofreciéndole posibles expectativas de continuar la tregua. Todos los gobernantes, indistintamente de ideologias, siempre se prestan a negociar con la serpiente y el hacha. Estamos en el 2008 y aún no escarmientan. Dios nos coja confesados con estos pólíticos que nos han tocado.Xabier Resulta llamativo comprobar que el PNV ha ofrecido una reacción furibunda que poco tiene que ver con la forma en que denuncia otros crímenes de ETA. Los jeltzales se han volcado en arropar a la familia, Ibarretxe se ha puesto al mando de las manifestaciones de condena y los concejales no han dudado en censurar sin complejos ni medias tintas la infame actitud de ANV. Como recordó ayer Arzalluz, los etarras han asesinado a «un hombre de la tierra» al que conocía en persona porque son «del mismo valle». Una afirmación parecida a aquella que pronunció un dirigente del PNV cuando, en agosto de 2000, fue asesinado el empresario José María Korta. Entonces, el diputado general de Guipúzcoa, Román Sudupe, afirmó que se trataba de «un abertzale, uno de los nuestros». Inexplicables distinciones entre asesinados según su adscripción ideológica o lugar de nacimiento.Nacionali

Talleres Soy - Los 'pibes' volvieron a poner la cara 18/02/2019 - Con un equipo alternativo, Talleres igualó sin goles frente a Huracán y sumó su segundo empate consecutivo en esta Superliga. En ambas ocasiones, ante equipos que pelean arriba. Con un ojo puesto en el partido por Copa del miércoles y otro en la Superliga, Talleres empató 0-0 frente al Globo en el Mario Alberto Kempes. En un encuentro sin demasiadas luces, los juveniles de la "T" volvieron a sacar pecho ante uno de los equipos mejor ubicados de la tabla y, al igual que en Tucumán, demostraron estar a la altura. En el primer tiempo, Huracán no supo como encontrarle la vuelta al equipo de Vojvoda. A base de garra y una cuota de buen fútbol (de lo poco que hubo en la tarde), los locales tuvieron las situaciones más claras en esos primeros 45 minutos. La primera llegó en los pies de Fernando Bersano, quien tras recibir un muy buen pase filtrado de Gonzalo Maroni, puso a prueba los reflejos del arquero rival, Anthony Silva. El 10 del Matador, al igual que Medina, volvió a tener minutos en cancha luego de lo que fue su participación en el Torneo Sudamericano sub 20. A los 22 minutos, Talleres volvió a intentar mediante una muy buena aproximación del ex Boca, que tuvo la última del primer tiempo. En el complemento, si bien la "T" siguió teniendo situaciones claras, el Globo empezó a acercarse un poco más al arco defendido por Mauricio Caranta, a quien lo pusieron a prueba y respondió. Después de otra llegada del local a través de Bersano, Huracán tuvo la primer chance clara en el partido con un cabezazo de su lateral izquierdo, Walter Pérez. El defensor apareció por sorpresa en el área rival y con un cabezazo hizo volar al experimentado arquero albiazul, quien mandó la pelota al corner. Minutos después, a los 25' más precisamente, Caranta volvió a aparecer para sacarle un muy buen remate, esta vez a Juan Fernando Garro, quien había ingresado minutos antes en lugar de Lucas Gamba. Mientras más se iba acercando el final del partido, más iba disminuyendo el rendimiento colectivo de Talleres, así como el de sus intérpretes. Luego de la lesión de Javier Gandolfi antes de cumplirse los 30 minutos del complemento, el compromiso entró en una meseta y ninguno de los equipos logró situaciones de peligro. El final fue un reflejo de lo que fue el encuentro en general: chato y aburrido. El Matador, con la cabeza puesta en la siguiente fase de Libertadores, sumó otro punto importante ante uno de los rivales "más difíciles" del torneo. Si bien hoy Huracán no lo demostró así, posee una ubicación privilegiada en la tabla junto a los que pelean por el título. Así mismo, el triunfo hubiera sido tan solo una caricia al alma dentro de una jornada tan opaca como lo fue debido a la lesión de Leonardo Godoy, uno de los pilares que tiene este equipo de la "T". Talleres: Mauricio Caranta; Re

El debido proceso, en la mira de los intolerantes | El Diario de Entre Ríos Raúl Barrandeguy, codefensor del ex gobernador Sergio Urribarri, pidió que quienes organizaron el ataque en Tribunales y en la calle contra los defensores "deben ser públicamente amonestados". Sostuvo que quienes organizaron y garantizaron el ingreso del grupo de libertarios a Tribunales arremetieron "contra uno de los más valiosos principios civilizatorios de la modernidad que es el debido proceso". En un comunicado que envió a EL DIARIO y tituló "Un 'Mini' Pogrom en la Justicia entrerriana", Raúl Enrique Barrandeguy, abogado entrerriano de prestigiosa carrera, tanto en el ejercicio de la profesión como cuando se desempeñó como legislador, opinó sobre los graves hechos ocurridos al finalizar la audiencia en la que se discutió la sentencia de primera instancia que sobreseyó al ex gobernador, Sergio Urribarri, en una causa por el presunto delito contra la Administración Pública. Los hechos fueron de dominio público. Por la difusión que el periodismo realizó de los graves actos, como por la propia dinámica de los hechos: el grupo de libertarios, en su mayoría mujeres, agredió verbalmente a los defensores en la sala de audiencias, en los pasillos de Tribunales y en la calle, a viva voz y a la vista de los ocasionales transeúntes. También difundieron su accionar en redes sociales. Tras hacer un repaso de la dinámica del ataque, Barrandeguy consideró que "…la cuestión más delicada de todas cuantas estaban sucediendo", consistió en que "el motivo principal de la agresión según lo expresaron las manifestantes era que nosotros, los agredidos, éramos defensores del ex gobernador imputado, circunstancia que asume una enorme gravedad". El letrado reconoció que ni él ni sus colegas sufrieron violencia física, pero añadió que "es verdad que a duras penas pudieron contenerse, pero lo hicieron. Blandían sus pancartas y agitaban sus puños sobre nuestros rostros, aunque sin llegar a golpearnos. Sin e

ACUERDO por el que se dan a conocer los resultados del estudio técnico de las aguas nacionales subterráneas del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, Región Hidrológico-Administrativa VII, Cuencas Centrales del Norte Que el 5 de diciembre de 2001, se publicó en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el "ACUERDO por el que se establece y da a conocer al público en general la denominación única de los acuíferos reconocidos en el territorio de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, por la Comisión Nacional del Agua, y la homologación de los nombres de los acuíferos que fueron utilizados para la emisión de los títulos de concesión, asignación o permisos otorgados por este órgano desconcentrado", a través del cual, al acuífero objeto de este estudio técnico se le asignó el nombre oficial de Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas; Que a través del "ACUERDO por el que se da a conocer la ubicación geográfica de 371 acuíferos del territorio nacional, se actualiza la disponibilidad media anual de agua subterránea de 282 acuíferos, y se modifica, para su mejor precisión, la descripción geográfica de 202 acuíferos", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 28 de agosto de 2009, se modificaron los límites del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, identificados con vértices de la poligonal simplificada en coordenadas geográficas que fueron determinadas con base en la versión magnética del Marco Geoestadístico Municipal 2000 del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía y su base cartográfica escala 1:250,000, en coordenadas geográficas y NAD27 como Datum; Que el 4 de enero de 2018, se publicó en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el "ACUERDO por el que se actualiza la disponibilidad media anual de agua subterránea de los 653 acuíferos de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, mismos que forman parte de las Regiones Hidrológico-Administrativas que se indican", en el que se actualizó la disponibilidad media anual del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, obteniéndose un déficit de 48.350774 millones de metros cúbicos anuales, con fecha de corte en el Registro Público de Derechos de Agua al 31 de diciembre de 2015; Que en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, se encuentran vigentes los siguientes instrumentos jurídicos: a) "DECRETO que establece veda por tiempo indefinido para el alumbramiento de aguas del subsuelo en la zona del Estado de Zacatecas, que comprende la cuenca media del río Aguanaval y otros", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 16 de mayo de 1960, cuyas disposiciones aplican en el área suroccidental del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, y b) "DECRETO por el que se declara de interés público la conservación de los mantos acuíferos en los Municipios de Noria de Ángeles, Pinos, etc., ubicados en el Estado de Zacatecas", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 9 de febrero de 1978, cuyas disposiciones aplican en la mayor parte de la extensión del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229; Que el acuífero referido, se encuentra completamente vedado por los Decretos anteriores; no obstante, dichos instrumentos regulatorios no han sido suficientes para lograr revertir la problemática que a lo largo de estos años ha enfrentado el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, aunado a las condiciones hidrológicas que se precisan en el presente estudio técnico, y la gran demanda de aguas subterráneas, principalmente para uso agrícola que hay en la región; Que la Comisión Nacional del Agua, con fundamento en los artículos 38, párrafo primero de la Ley de Aguas Nacionales, en relación con el diverso 73 de su Reglamento, ha procedido a formular el estudio técnico del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, con el propósito de determinar si es necesario modificar el marco regulatorio vigente en materia de control de la explotación, uso o aprovechamiento de las aguas nacionales del subsuelo, conforme a las causales de utilidad e interés público, previstas en la propia Ley, y en su caso, sustentar la emisión del ordenamiento procedente, mediante el cual se establezcan los mecanismos para su regulación, que permitan llevar a cabo su administración y uso sustentable; Que para la elaboración del estudio técnico, se promovió la participación de los usuarios a través del Consejo de Cuenca del Altiplano, a quienes se les presentaron los resultados de los mismos en la Décima Reunión Ordinaria de su Comisión de Operación y Vigilancia, celebrada el día 30 de junio de 2017, en la Ciudad de Zacatecas, en el Estado de Zacatecas, por lo que he tenido a bien expedir el siguiente: AGUAS NACIONALES SUBTERRÁNEAS DEL ACUÍFERO LORETO, CLAVE 3229, EN EL ESTADO DE ARTÍCULO ÚNICO.- Se dan a conocer los resultados del estudio técnico realizado en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, ubicado en el Estado de Zacatecas, en los términos siguientes: El acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se localiza en la porción suroriental del Estado de Zacatecas, entre el límite con el Estado de Aguascalientes (Mapa 1), con una superficie aproximada de 689 kilómetros cuadrados; la cual comprende parcialmente los municipios de Loreto, Noria de Ángeles y González Ortega; así como pequeñas áreas de los municipios de Ojocaliente, Villa García y Luis Moya. Administrativamente pertenece a la Región Hidrológico-Administrativa VII, Cuencas Centrales del Norte. Los límites del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, están definidos por los vértices de la poligonal simplificada cuyas coordenadas geográficas se presentan a continuación y corresponden a las establecidas en el "ACUERDO por el que se da a conocer la ubicación geográfica de 371 acuíferos del territorio nacional, se actualiza la disponibilidad media anual de agua subterránea de 282 acuíferos, y se modifica, para su mejor precisión, la descripción geográfica de 202 acuíferos", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 28 de agosto de 2009: ACUÍFERO LORETO, CLAVE 3229 DEL 10 AL 11 POR EL LIMITE ESTATAL DEL 11 AL 12 POR EL LIMITE ESTATAL Para mayor precisión se ilustra en el siguiente mapa, la ubicación del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas: De acuerdo con los datos publicados por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía Censo 2000, Conteo 2005 y la Proyección de Población 2005-2050 del Consejo Nacional de Población, la población circunscrita al acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, es de 51,234 habitantes. Las principales localidades urbanas que se ubican dentro del límite del acuífero son: Loreto, Villa González Ortega, Estancia de Ánimas, San Marcos, Tierra Blanca y Maravillas. Del total de la población, el 64 por ciento es urbana y 36 por ciento rural. La ciudad de Loreto, es la principal localidad urbana, la cual concentra el 43 por ciento del total de la población que habita en la superficie del acuífero. Las coberturas promedio de agua potable y alcantarillado de las localidades de la región son de 88 y 73 por ciento, para localidades urbanas y rurales, respectivamente. El sector agrícola es el principal usuario del agua subterránea, que extrae el 90.4 por ciento del volumen total en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229. Para el periodo comprendido entre los años 2013 a 2015, se reportaron un promedio de 32,210 hectáreas por año bajo explotación agrícola; de las cuales 9,933 hectáreas, equivalentes al 27.7 por ciento son de riego, y 23,276 hectáreas son de temporal, las cuales representan el 72.3 por ciento. En términos de valor de la producción, aun cuando la superficie de agricultura de riego es aproximadamente 2.5 veces menor a la de temporal, representa el 88 por ciento del valor total de la producción. La superficie que se siembra bajo riego equivale al 6 por ciento de la superficie de riego en el Estado. Con base en su extensión, los principales cultivos cíclicos son maíz, frijol, lechuga y avena forrajera, mientras que entre los perennes, se ubica a la alfalfa como la de mayor importancia. Se estima que prácticamente el 94 por ciento de la superficie regada, se emplea para cultivos cíclicos, y el 6 por ciento restante por los perennes. Para este último caso, la alfalfa representa por sí sola el 81 por ciento de la superficie regada para cultivos perennes. De acuerdo con la clasificación de Köppen, modificada por Enriqueta García en 1964 para las condiciones de la República Mexicana, en el acuífero prevalece el clima seco estepario BS, que corresponde con el más seco de este tipo de climas, subtipo semiseco con grado de humedad mayor que 22.9. La temporada de lluvia se concentra en verano, la máxima precipitación cae dentro del periodo mayo-octubre, su porcentaje de lluvia invernal varía entre 5 y 10.2 y se caracteriza por presentar una temperatura media anual que varía entre 18 y 22 grados Centígrados. Para la determinación de las variables climatológicas se tomaron en cuenta los registros obtenidos para diferentes periodos de años, el más grande de 1963 a 2012 y el más corto de 2004 a 2012, con esta información se determinaron valores de precipitación, temperatura y evaporación potencial media anual de 397.4 milímetros, 17.1 grados centígrados y 2 056.5 milímetros, respectivamente. El área que comprende el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se ubica en su extensión total dentro de la Provincia Fisiográfica Mesa Central. Por otro lado, de acuerdo con la regionalización fisiográfica del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI, 1981), el acuífero se ubica en las Provincias Fisiográficas Mesa del Centro, la mayor parte en la Subprovincia Llanuras de Ojuelos-Aguascalientes y la porción norte en la Subprovincia Llanuras y Sierras Potosino-Zacatecanas. Los sistemas de topoformas que se presentan en la zona corresponden a un extenso llano de piso rocoso, limitado en su porción norte por bajadas aluviales, al poniente por lomeríos de pie de monte con mesetas, al suroeste se presenta una sierra baja con mesetas, al oriente se observa una pequeña sierra abrupta y al sureste los rasgos corresponden a una mesa extensa. En el extremo sur existe un puerto topográfico labrado en rocas riolíticas y en la porción nororiental las sierras no son continuas, y en ella existen angostas llanuras que comunican con otras planicies. Las mayores elevaciones se presentan en la región noroccidental, en el Cerro La Biznaga, con una elevación de 2,400 metros sobre el nivel del mar, y en las sierras de Asientos y de San Marcos, donde se presentan elevaciones del orden de 2,500 metros sobre el nivel del mar. La altura del llano oscila entre 2,030 y 2,100 metros sobre el nivel del mar y está orientado en dirección preferencial norte-sur. La sierra localizada en la porción occidental, tiene forma alargada orientada norte-sur y su elevación aproximada es de 2,300 metros sobre el nivel del mar. En la porción norte, cerca del poblado Pastoría, se encuentra una elevación topográfica dentro de la sierra, la cual corresponde a un intrusivo granítico. En la porción centro-sur se presentan materiales de pie de monte, que conforman lomeríos redondeados de suave pendiente. En la porción sureste se encuentra una sierra formada esencialmente por rocas de composición riolítica, las cuales presentan formas relativamente suaves. Al norte, las elevaciones topográficas corresponden a afloramientos de calizas y lutitas, en forma de lomeríos redondeados de pendientes suaves, separados por llanuras aluviales. El marco geológico regional está representado por los eventos relacionados con el establecimiento de la Sierra Madre Occidental y la evolución del Terreno Guerrero, que fue definido por Campa (1983), que presentan características litoestratigráficas diferentes. De esta manera, del Terreno Guerrero se presentan unidades metamorfizadas de edad Cretácico, y unidades de origen volcánico del Terciario, pertenecientes a la Sierra Madre Occidental. Completan la columna unidades de edad cuaternaria que consisten en basaltos y materiales aluviales. A nivel regional, la unidad más antigua corresponde al Triásico Superior y está conformada por una secuencia de rocas metamórficas y metasedimentarias que presentan metamorfismo de bajo grado en facies de esquistos verdes, conocida como Formación Zacatecas. Al sureste aflora una secuencia vulcanosedimentaria metamorfizada en facies de esquistos verdes, que aflora en el distrito minero de Tepezalá, donde cabalga a rocas del Cretácico Inferior, cuya edad se asigna al Jurásico Superior y se denomina Formación Cieneguitas (Dávila, 1988). Sobre ella descansa concordantemente la unidad nombrada informalmente como Formación El Varal (Velasco, 1989), conformada por calizas y lutitas con bandas y nódulos de pedernal; ambas unidades afloran de manera aislada en forma de ventanas estructurales, presentan metamorfismo regional de bajo grado y están intrusionadas por un tronco diorítico de edad Cretácico Inferior. Del Jurásico aflora una secuencia calcárea marina depositada en un ambiente nerítico, de aguas tranquilas, perteneciente a la Formación Zuloaga, sobreyacida concordantemente por una secuencia calcárea, depositada en un ambiente de escasa energía, correspondiente a la Formación La Caja. Del Cretácico existen pequeños afloramientos de la Formación Taraises, constituida por una alternancia de calizas y lutitas que descansan, de manera concordante y transicional, sobre La Formación Cupido, constituida por una alternancia de calizas y lutitas. La Formación La Peña descansa transicionalmente sobre la formación anterior, es de edad aptiana, consiste de calizas arcillosas y lutitas. Distribuida en la porción central de la región se observa la Formación Cuesta del Cura constituida por una secuencia de calizas y lutitas de edad Albiano-Cenomaniano, que subyace por relación concordante y transicional a la Formación Indidura, la cual está constituida por una alternancia de caliza y lutita, de edad Turoniano, depositada en agua tranquila, poco profunda; encima transicionalmente se tiene a las lutitas y areniscas de la Formación Caracol, de edad del Coniaciano al Maestrichtiano. Durante el Terciario, en el occidente de México, se presentó la influencia de un arco magmático generado por la tectónica convergente, dando lugar a la emisión de rocas volcánicas que conforman la Sierra Madre Occidental, Mc Dowell (1979) establece que la sierra está constituida por dos secuencias ígneas, una inferior que consta principalmente de rocas ígneas intermedias, con edades que varían de 45 a 95 millones de años (Paleoceno), y que corresponden con derrames, flujos piroclásticos y algunas intercalaciones de flujos ignimbríticos. La secuencia superior y más reciente está integrada por una potente cubierta de ignimbritas que de acuerdo con Demant (1975) puede alcanzar 1,000 metros de espesor, cuya edad se considera entre 27 y 34 millones de años (Oligoceno). Las rocas intrusivas cortan la secuencia volcánica terciaria y afloran de manera restringida, son de composición granítica, granodiorítica y diorítica. En algunas localidades se observa la presencia de cuerpos intrusivos de tipo pórfido andesítico y dacítico, que afectaron a este paquete volcánico y a los que se les atribuye la mineralización en algunos sitios. Los eventos volcánicos se manifestaron hasta el Plio-Cuaternario. Durante el Pleistoceno-Holoceno se depositaron cenizas riolíticas y lapilli, que presentan estratificación masiva, y arenas finas con estratificación cruzada, que presentan restos de vertebrados. Rellenando las depresiones topográficas, se encuentra material aluvial, constituido principalmente por gravas, arenas y limos. El acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se encuentra localizado en la Región Hidrológica 37 El Salado, en la Cuenca Hidrológica San Pablo y Otras. Entre los arroyos de mayor importancia destacan El Muerto, San Patricio, El Jaral y Las Blancas; en la parte sur de la zona existen corrientes que escurren hacia el Valle de Chicalote, en el Estado de Aguascalientes. Los tipos de drenaje que se observan en el área son de tipo dendrítico, paralelo y subparalelo; el primero se presenta en las regiones montañosas y los últimos en los llanos y planicies, donde llegan a desaparecer. Los arroyos son de carácter torrencial, únicamente tienen escurrimientos durante la época de lluvias y descargan en pequeñas lagunas, presas y bordos diseminados en toda el área. Al este de la Ciudad de Loreto se ubica la Presa San Marcos, que recibe los escurrimientos de los arroyos El Muerto, Blanco y Gatera; esta última es la obra hidráulica más importante de la zona, con una capacidad de almacenamiento de 5 millones de metros cúbicos para riego de 352 hectáreas. Las evidencias geológicas, geofísicas e hidrogeológicas, permiten definir la presencia de un acuífero de tipo libre, heterogéneo y anisótropo, constituido en su porción superior por sedimentos aluviales y fluviales, de granulometría variada, y conglomerados; en el centro de la llanura, estos depósitos pueden alcanzar espesores de algunos cientos de metros. La porción inferior se aloja en una secuencia de rocas volcánicas y sedimentarias que presentan permeabilidad secundaria por fracturamiento. A mayor profundidad las calizas y areniscas representan un acuífero potencial, que puede presentar condiciones de semiconfinamiento, debido a que están sobreyacidas y alternadas con lutitas y limolitas. En la llanura se pueden distinguir tres medios diferentes por donde circula el agua subterránea: el medio poroso, con permeabilidad primaria, secundaria, intergranular y de fracturas; el medio fracturado, con permeabilidad secundaria, y el medio de doble porosidad, con permeabilidad combinada, intergranular y de fracturas. Las fronteras y barreras al flujo subterráneo están representadas por las mismas rocas sedimentarias y volcánicas, cuando éstas se presentan compactas; por rocas metamórficas y metasedimentarias, así como localmente por rocas intrusivas. Profundidad al nivel estático. La profundidad al nivel estático en el año 2015 muestra que los valores varían, de manera general, de 40 a 140 metros, los cuales se incrementan por efecto de la topografía, desde el centro del llano hacia las estribaciones de las sierras que lo delimitan. Los niveles estáticos más someros, de 40 a 50 metros, se presentan en la porción norte del acuífero, al este del poblado Estancia de Ánimas; en tanto que los más profundos, de 100 a 140 metros, se registran en el flanco oriental, en la zona comprendida entre las ciudad de Loreto y San Marcos, hasta las inmediaciones de Noria de Ángeles. En la zona agrícola la profundidad al nivel estático varía de 70 a 90 metros. Elevación del nivel estático. La configuración de elevación del nivel estático para el año 2015 registró valores que variaron de 2,100 a 1,920 metros sobre el nivel del mar, los cuales decrecen gradualmente desde la porción norte del acuífero hacia la llanura aluvial, localizada en la región centro y continua hacia el sur, mostrando de esta manera una dirección preferencial del flujo subterráneo norte-sur, con alimentaciones provenientes de los flancos oriental y occidental. En la porción sur del acuífero, se ha formado un extenso cono de abatimiento, entre la Ciudad de Loreto y la localidad Tierra Blanca, induciendo también flujo subterráneo procedente del acuífero vecino Valle de Chicalote, del Estado de Aguascalientes. De esta manera, las menores elevaciones, de 1,920 a 1,940 metros sobre el nivel del mar, se registran en la porción sur del acuífero, entre la Ciudad de Loreto y el poblado Tierra Blanca; en tanto que las mayores elevaciones, de 2,070 a 2,100 metros sobre el nivel del mar, se presentan al norte, entorno del poblado Estancia de Ánimas. Evolución del nivel estático. La configuración de evolución del nivel estático para el periodo de años de 1998 a 2015, registra valores de abatimiento en la mayor parte de la superficie del acuífero, que varían de 5 a 50 metros. Es muy notable el extenso cono de abatimiento que se ha formado en la región comprendida entre las poblaciones Loreto, Tierra Blanca y Madero, en donde se ubica la región agrícola de extracción intensiva. En esta zona el abatimiento medio anual es de 2.4 metros. En la superficie restante del acuífero, el ritmo de abatimiento varía de 0.3 a 1.2 metros anuales. De los resultados obtenidos de los análisis fisicoquímicos, realizados al acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se determinó que los valores de concentración de sólidos totales disueltos varían de 350 a 500 miligramos por litro, que no superan el límite máximo permisible de 1000 miligramos por litro, establecido por la Norma Oficial Mexicana "MODIFICACIÓN de la Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-127-SSA1-1994, Salud ambiental. Agua para uso y consumo humano. Límites permisibles de calidad y tratamientos a que debe someterse el agua para su potabilización", publicada en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 22 de noviembre del 2000. Los valores más altos de sólidos totales disueltos se registran al sur del acuífero y se incrementan en dirección general norte-sur, confirmando con ello la dirección preferencial del flujo subterráneo. Los valores más bajos se presentan en la región norte y en los flancos oriental y occidental del acuífero, donde se ubican las principales zonas de recarga. Los valores de temperatura varían de 23.5 a 32.7 grados centígrados y el potencial Hidrógeno varía de 6.99 a 7.80, valores que son representativos de agua que se considera ligeramente alcalina. Por otra parte, de acuerdo con el criterio de Wilcox, en el acuífero predomina el agua de salinidad media con bajo contenido de sodio, que se considera apta para el uso agrícola, sin restricción alguna en el tipo de cultivos y suelos. En menor proporción presenta aguas de salinidad alta con bajo contenido de sodio, cuya utilización en la agricultura requiere de suelos con buen drenaje y lavados periódicos. De acuerdo con el balance hidrogeológico realizado por la Comisión Nacional del Agua, la recarga media anual total que recibe el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, es de 32.7 millones de metros cúbicos anuales; integrados por 26.3 millones de metros cúbicos anuales generados por entradas de flujo subterráneo; 2.7 millones de metros cúbicos anuales por recarga vertical, producto del agua de lluvia que se infiltra, y 3.7 millones de metros cúbicos anuales que ingresan al acuífero como recarga inducida debido a los retornos del riego agrícola. Las salidas del acuífero están conformadas únicamente por el bombeo. No existen salidas naturales subterráneas, descargas de manantiales, por evapotranspiración, ni por flujo base de ríos. El cambio de almacenamiento es negativo, lo que indica que corresponde a un minado de la reserva no renovable del acuífero, y provoca un abatimiento continuo de los niveles del agua subterránea. DE AGUA DEL SUBSUELO EN La disponibilidad media anual en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se determinó considerando una recarga media anual de 32.7 millones de metros cúbicos anuales, no existe descarga natural comprometida; un volumen de aguas subterráneas concesionado e inscrito en el Registro Público de Derechos de Agua, con fecha de corte al 31 de diciembre de 2015, de 81.050774 millones de metros cúbicos anuales, resultando un déficit de 48.350774 millones de metros cúbicos anuales. 81.050774 48.350774 Esta cifra indica que no existe volumen disponible para otorgar concesiones o asignaciones en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229. El volumen máximo que puede extraerse del acuífero para mantenerlo en condiciones sustentables, es de 32.7 millones de metros cúbicos anuales, que corresponde al volumen de recarga media anual que recibe el acuífero, ya que la descarga natural comprometida se considera nula. Actualmente, en la extensión del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en el Estado de Zacatecas, se encuentran vigentes los siguientes Decretos de veda de aguas del subsuelo: b) "Decreto por el que se declara de interés público la conservación de los mantos acuíferos en los Municipios de Noria de Ángeles, Pinos, etc., ubicados en el Estado de Zacatecas", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 9 de febrero de 1978, cuyas disposiciones aplican en la mayor parte de la extensión del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229. Con relación a dichos instrumentos, cabe señalar que conforme a la Ley Reglamentaria del párrafo quinto del artículo 27 Constitucional, en materia de aguas del subsuelo, vigente para la veda establecida en el año 1960, y la Ley Federal de Aguas, vigente para la veda establecida en 1978, dichas regulaciones tuvieron por efectos jurídicos permitir de forma controlada nuevas extracciones mediante título de asignación o concesión y permiso para obras de alumbramiento, a fin de procurar la conservación de los acuíferos en condiciones de explotación racional. Considerando que dichos instrumentos jurídicos fueron emitidos en 1960 y 1978, el ámbito espacial de su aplicación se determinó con base en la división política de los municipios y entidades federativas, posteriormente, el 5 de diciembre de 2001 se publicó en el Diario Oficial de la Federación, el "ACUERDO por el que se establece y da a conocer al público en general la denominación única de los acuíferos reconocidos en el territorio de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, por la Comisión Nacional del Agua, y la homologación de los nombres de los acuíferos que fueron utilizados para la emisión de los títulos de concesión, asignación o permisos otorgados por este órgano desconcentrado", instrumento que vinculado con el uso de equipos de geoposicionamiento, el desarrollo de sistemas de información geográfica y la disponibilidad de herramientas computacionales, han permitido que a la fecha se logren identificar las áreas de dichas unidades de gestión, ubicarlas en coordenadas geográficas y establecer sus límites, así como relacionar su localización con el ámbito territorial en el que surten efectos los Decretos señalados. A continuación se ilustran en el mapa las áreas dentro del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, en las que tienen aplicabilidad las disposiciones de los instrumentos jurídicos anteriormente referidos: El acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se localiza en la región semiárida del Estado de Zacatecas, presenta características de baja precipitación y alta tasa de evaporación, lo cual disminuye la disponibilidad de agua superficial e incrementa la presión sobre el agua de origen subterráneo. La precipitación pluvial es del orden de 397 milímetros por año, que equivale al 85.6 por ciento de la media anual registrada en la entidad, muy por debajo de la media nacional, representando el 57.2 por ciento de la media anual del país. La temperatura media anual es de 17 grados centígrados, y la evaporación potencial media de 2,056 milímetros anuales; estas características se traducen en una escasez natural de agua. Uno de los fenómenos climáticos que más afecta a las actividades económicas del país es la sequía, el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional se encarga de detectar el estado actual y la evolución de este fenómeno, para lo que se apoya en el Monitor de Sequía en México, que consta de un Reporte que contiene una descripción de la sequía en el país, tablas y gráficos de porcentaje del área afectada por sequía a nivel nacional. Se predice para la región una expansión geográfica de sequías catalogadas como muy fuertes. Los resultados de la evolución del nivel estático en el periodo comprendido entre los años 1998 a 2015, indican que la zona con abatimientos más críticos se localiza en la porción comprendida entre las poblaciones Loreto, Tierra Blanca y Madero, que es precisamente donde se ubica la región agrícola, y se ha formado un gran cono de abatimiento con descenso en el nivel del agua, del orden de 2.4 metros por año. El acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, presenta condiciones de sobreexplotación, debido a que la extracción de agua subterránea ha sido durante un tiempo prolongado superior a la recarga que recibe, por lo que actualmente se presentan los efectos negativos asociados, tales como el descenso de los niveles de agua subterránea, el deterioro de la calidad del agua subterránea, lo que se traduce en una baja rentabilidad de varios cultivos; lo cual ha traído consigo un freno al desarrollo de diversos sectores productivos y una fuerte competencia por el uso del agua. La calidad del agua subterránea en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, podría verse afectada por la extracción de agua cada vez más profunda y más antigua que circula a través de las rocas volcánicas fracturadas, que puede disolver diferentes elementos de origen natural nocivos para la salud. Adicionalmente en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, existe el riesgo de contaminación, debido al retorno del riego agrícola, que por el uso de agroquímicos representa una fuente potencial de contaminación al agua subterránea. · El acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, recibe una recarga media anual de 32.7 millones de metros cúbicos anuales; mientras que el volumen de extracción de agua subterránea concesionado para los diversos usos es de 81.050774 millones de metros cúbicos anuales. · La disponibilidad media anual de agua subterránea presenta un déficit de 48.350774 millones de metros cúbicos anuales, por lo que no existe volumen disponible para otorgar concesiones o asignaciones. · La extensión total del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se encuentra sujeta a las disposiciones de los instrumentos jurídicos referidos en el considerando séptimo del presente estudio técnico; que en términos de la Ley Reglamentaria del párrafo quinto del artículo 27 Constitucional, en materia de aguas del subsuelo vigente en 1960 y de la Ley Federal de Aguas vigente en 1978, constituían un medio de control de los aprovechamientos. · Actualmente se presentan diversos efectos negativos asociados a la sobreexplotación, tales como el descenso de los niveles de agua y reducción en el rendimiento de los pozos, con el consiguiente incremento en los costos de bombeo, lo que ha propiciado que algunos cultivos resulten poco rentables, con lo que se ha afectado al sector agrícola principal consumidor del agua. · Existen además otras evidencias vinculadas a la sobreexplotación del acuífero, como los agrietamientos y los asentamientos del terreno, por lo que está en riesgo la sustentabilidad del acuífero, ya que de continuar el mismo ritmo de extracción, existe la amenaza de que la sobreexplotación se agrave, sin posibilidad de recuperación y por tanto, que la problemática adquiera mayores dimensiones en detrimento del ambiente y de los usuarios de las aguas nacionales subterráneas en la región. · De los resultados expuestos, en el acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, se presentan las causales de utilidad e interés público, referidas en los artículos 7 y 7 BIS de la Ley de Aguas Nacionales, relativas a la protección, mejoramiento, conservación y restauración del recurso hídrico; a la atención prioritaria de la problemática hídrica en zonas de escasez natural; al control de la extracción, explotación, aprovechamiento y uso de las aguas del subsuelo; el restablecimiento del equilibrio hidrológico de las aguas nacionales del subsuelo, así como la sustentabilidad ambiental y la prevención del aumento de la sobreexplotación del acuífero; causales que justifican el establecimiento de una zona de veda para un mayor control de la extracción, explotación, uso y aprovechamiento de las aguas del subsuelo, que abarque la totalidad de la extensión territorial del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, para alcanzar la gestión integrada de los recursos hídricos. · Suprimir en la extensión del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, la veda establecida mediante el "DECRETO que establece veda por tiempo indefinido para el alumbramiento de aguas del subsuelo en la zona del Estado de Zacatecas, que comprende la cuenca media del río Aguanaval y otros", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 16 de mayo de 1960. · Suprimir en la extensión del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, la veda establecida mediante el "DECRETO por el que se declara de interés público la conservación de los mantos acuíferos en los Municipios de Noria de Ángeles, Pinos, etc., ubicados en el Estado de Zacatecas", publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 9 de febrero de 1978. · La problemática del acuífero Loreto, clave 3229, reúne las causales de interés y utilidad pública, para que en términos legales se proceda a establecer dentro de sus límites oficiales, una zona de veda conforme a lo señalado en la fracción LXV del artículo 3 de la Ley de Aguas Nacionales. SEGUNDO.- El estudio técnico que contiene la información detallada, planos y memorias de cálculo con los que se elaboró el presente Acuerdo, estará disponible para consulta pública en las oficinas de la Comisión Nacional del Agua en su Nivel Nacional, ubicadas en Calzada México-Xochimilco Número 4985, Colonia Guadalupe, Alcaldía Tlalpan, Código Postal 14388, Ciudad de México, y en su Nivel Regional Hidrológico-Administrativo, en el Organismo de Cuenca Cuencas Centrales del Norte, sito en Calzada Manuel Ávila Camacho, Número 2777, Oriente, Colonia Las Magdalenas, Torreón, Coahuila, Código Postal 27010, así como en la Dirección Local Zacatecas, que se ubica en Avenida Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional Número 90, Zon

Atrás dejamos la playa, la montaña, la piscina, los largos días de descanso y los despertares a las doce del mediodía. Ahora toca madrugar y afrontar un nuevo curso con energía y motivación. Tras unas largas vacaciones, es hora de afrontar la vuelta al cole y a la rutina que ello supone. La capacidad de adaptación de los adultos a las rutinas y nuevas situaciones es totalmente distinta a la que tienen los niños debido al bagaje de experiencias que nos preceden y que nos permite adaptarnos de una forma más suave y controlada. Antes de la vuelta al cole, adapta sus horarios Pautas para la adaptación infantil en la vuelta al cole La forma de ser del niño influye en su capacidad de adaptación cuando llega a un sitio nuevo, con niños nuevos y, además, donde sus padres no están para guiarle. Para ello existen algunas pautas que agilizan y suavizan este proceso que, en ocasiones, puede provocar estrés en los pequeños, e incluso en los padres. Adaptación infantil de los horarios: cambiar los hábitos horarios de los niños es una de las principales condiciones a tener en cuenta para una rápida adaptación al colegio. Acostumbrados a echarse a dormir más tarde y despertarse también tarde, se hace difícil reestructurar sus hábitos. Para ello, en los últimos días de vacaciones es aconsejable acostarles antes e irles haciendo madrugar cada día un poco más. Así el cambio no será tan brusco. Despedidas rápidas: lo mejor cuando dejamos a nuestros niños en el colegio es despedirnos rápidamente. Si alargamos este mal trago, querrán quedarse con nosotros y les producirá un sentimiento de estrés que tardarán en olvidar. Despedirse rápido desde el primer día hará que al cabo de una semana ya no suponga un problema dejarlos en el cole, ni para ellos, ni para los padres. Objetos de apego: a los más pequeños les cuesta más adaptarse a este proceso. Por eso los expertos recomiendan acompañar al niño con un juguete al que le tenga mucho aprecio. Gracias a esto se sentirá arropado y acompañado de "alguien" familiar que le hará pasar la mañana mucho más rápido. Motivación: para empezar con buen pie es importante motivar a los niños en su primer día de colegio. Así empezarán con muchas ganas y dejarán el tópico de que "el colegio es aburrido" de lado. Alimentación para la adaptación infantil: todo esto no tiene mucho sentido si no atendemos los aspectos saludables. Una buena alimentación es la base para comenzar el día con energía y optimism

08/04/2014, 17:12 PM #1 Hola, la pasada semana, un individuo agregó al skype a dos bancadores de un pack de torneos que jugábamos para el parqué. Se hizo pasar por mí, utilizando una cuenta con nick punki.to, poniéndose de foto mi avatar y diciendo que era punkitopoker de poker-red. Contactó con davidpeters y javitxu6. El último se salvó porque entre que leyó el mensaje, yo ya me puse en contacto con él y no se percató hasta que saltó la alarma, de que el primer chico que le habló fuue él y no yo. Por desgracia, davidpeters cayó en la trampa y le envió dinero a una cuenta de skrill que el estafador le facilitó. Habíamos abierto un hilo denunciando el tema, pero se mando borrar porque JAvitxu consiguió contactar con el chico y no queríamos alarmarle. En la conversación obtuvo un nombre y apellidos y una cuenta bancaria. Esta cuenta, googleando, hemos visto qu

Castigada al Rincón del Pensamiento: Haul cuidado (facial-corporal-capilar) ¡Buenos días! ¿Qué tal todo por ahí? Aquí estoy de nuevo para traernos un pequeño haul de compritas de cuidado facial-corporal-capilar que he hecho últimamente, no son muchas (que la economía no está como para derrochar) pero son cosas necesarias y que me han ido bien, así que…¡comenzamos!: Viendo que mi crema diaria y el gel de Clarins están menguando (por desgracia…¡porque son fantásticos!) y que las muestras que probé de Olay que vinieron en una revista me han encantado, he pensado que ya que tenía que hacerme con algunos productos, sería una buena idea comprar algunas cositas de esta marca, cuya la relación calidad-precio me parece estupenda. Como veis he adquirido una Crema de Día en formato fluido para que no me resulte grasa, con protección solar. Esta hidratante diaria está diseñada según dicen para dar a tu piel lo necesario y mantenerla sana. La mantiene hidratada, contiene vitaminas (B3, E y pro-vitaminas B5) que la protegen contra los agentes externos y tiene el factor de protección solar mínimo, un 15, que evita que aunque sea invierno el sol dañe nuestra piel, la envejezca y nos salgan manchas. Además añaden que es ideal como base de maquillaje y que en 5 días veremos mejorías en la piel. Este fluido me costó unos 12 euros en las perfumerías If. De la misma gama (Complete) quise cogerme la Hidratante de Noche, porque hasta ahora usaba la misma crema de día que al acostarme, es decir, una sin protección solar y matificante. Pero he llegado a la conclusión de que ni debería salir sin protegerme del sol, ni debo forzar a la piel a mantenerse sin brillos durante la noche porque es su periodo de recuperación y renovación celular y debe estar cuidad e hidratada mientras dormimos. Esta crema sigue las mismas pautas que la de día, especificando que hidrata sin ser grasa, ayudando a reponer la hidratación perdida durante el día. Actúa mejorando la barrera natural de hidratación de la piel y evitando que la pierda durante el día siguiente. Además es no comedogénica, dermatológicamente testado y no obstruye los poros. Esta me costó alrededor de 9, 50 euros. Por último de cuidado facial cogí el Gel Espumoso Purificante para piel mixta. Ya lo probé hace un año o así, y me encantaba lo limpia que dejaba la piel. Esta especialmente formulada con un complejo Dual-Hydrox para limpiar en profundidad la piel y combatir el exceso de sebo, ayudando a combatir las imperfecciones. Su formula tiene salvia, té verde y aloe vera, que además de limpiar respeta la piel. Su precio 6, 25 euros. No hace mucho me pasé por el Mercadona y cogí algunas cositas. Un Gel Hidratante de Avena para piel sensible de Deliplus que huele fenomenal. Evita que la pie

Dover / I Ka Kené – jenesaispop.com Las hermanas Llanos le han debido de coger el gustillo a eso de reinventarse. Después de resurgir de sus propias cenizas con el pelo teñido, sonidos electrónicos, una clara fijación por Madonna y con 'Let Me Out' convertido en un single de éxito en todas las discotecas del país -y que incluso a día de hoy, después de reescucharlo, te apetece ponerte de nuevo-, ahora nos han salido con el africanismo por bandera, tal y como atestiguan la portada y el nombre de su nuevo trabajo: 'I Ka Kené'. El cambio es tan sorprendente que uno incluso comienza a preguntarse cómo convencen a las discográficas para que les publiquen sus nuevos discos. Y es que haciendo memoria no es difícil recordar que por muy mainstream que fueran (probablemente hasta tu madre supiera quién cantaba 'Devil Came To Me'), hubo un tiempo en el que se mantuvieron fieles a sus orígenes (y ahí está para recordarlo aquello de «DJ, don't do this to me»). Con sus fans de base posiblemente mirando ya para otro lado y ajenos a cualquier cosa que pueda venir de la banda madrileña, queda por ver cómo se tomarán sus nuevos seguidores (en caso de que puedan ser considerados como un grupo de personas heterogéneo) este nuevo giro de género. Por suerte, los Dover cuentan con 'Dannayá', un single que llegará fácilmente a las masas. Es una canción divertida, con bastante trallote, una repetición de riff medio gracioso al comienzo y unos oééés y heyheys muy apañados que el gran público puede corear con bastante facilidad. Claro que, lejos de todo esto, es fácil darse cuenta de que la producción del tema es un auténtico despropósito de efectos cutres, baterías y sintetizadores que, si bien hacen su trabajo, no dejan de ser de lo más hortera que has escuchado en tu vida. Eso hasta que lees la letra de 'Under Your Spell' (¿a qué viene esa cursilada de «So Mr. Daylight, the summer is back»?) o hasta que escuchas las pretendidas voces africanas de 'Yafama', que son como de película de terror. Así, es difícil adivinar dónde acaba el pastiche y dónde empieza el verdadero africanismo. ¿No será una triste estrategia de márketing? Porque es bastante duro ver la promoción que ha recibido este álbum para después encontrar apare

El Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea cierra la puerta a que los países europeos deban entregar visados humanitarios de forma obligatoria. Los jueces han dictaminado que los Estados miembros "no están obligados, en virtud del Derecho de la Unión, a expedir un visado humanitario a las personas que deseen entrar en su territorio con la intención de pedir asilo, pero son libres de hacerlo sobre la base de su Derecho nacional". Más información El abogado de la UE ve obligatorio dar visado humanitario si hay riesgo de tortura El abogado que evoca a Aylan para recordar sus valores a Europa La sentencia ahuyenta los temores de un amplio número de Estados europeos. Representantes de 13 de ellos, entre los que se contaban Francia y Alemania, intervinieron en una audiencia ante los tribunales para defender su derecho a negar la entrada para pedir asilo incluso a personas en riesgo de sufrir torturas o amenazas en sus países de origen. Entre los argumentos, esgrimían su incapacidad de acoger a todas las personas en esta situación y que sus consulados y embajadas, donde se tramitarían las demandas, podrían sufrir un alud de peticiones para el que no están preparadas. Todo empezó con la denuncia de una familia siria a la que el Gobierno belga negó el visado humanitario. El matrimonio y sus tres hijos, originarios de Alepo, solicitaron los documentos en la embajada belga de Líbano. Alegaron que temían sufrir persecución religiosa por su condición de cristianos y que sus vidas corrían peligro después de que, según su versión, uno de sus miembros fuera secuestrado, golpeado y liberado tras el pago de un rescate. Las autoridades de extranjería belgas le negaron repetidamente su entrada al país argumentando que la intención de la familia era quedarse más allá de los 90 días a los que le daría derecho el visado, por lo que recurrieron a lo

Cómo podría ser el nuevo Los Andes que imagina Cavalieri :: Diario La Unión | Informando desde 1897 Cómo podría ser el nuevo Los Andes que imagina Cavalieri Se arma. Con seis refuerzos hasta el momento, Los Andes cuenta hoy con un plantel de 20 futbolistas y, de a poco, comienza a darle forma a un once titular. El nuevo plantel ya cuenta con 20 futbolistas. Con las recientes contrataciones de Rivas y Mbombaj, Los Andes suma seis contrataciones en el actual mercado de pases y, de a poco, el nuevo equipo del técnico Germán Cavalieri comienza a tomar forma. Hasta el momento, el Milrayitas incorporó cuatro defensores, dos laterales (Minervino y Vaca) y dos zagueros centrales (Cepeda y García), y ahora sumó dos mediocampistas más, uno creativo (Rivas) y otro por la izquierda (Mbombaj), para cumplir los huecos que tenía el plantel tras la salida de varios futbolistas el 30 de junio. Así, de esta manera, Los Andes ya tiene una base importante de lo que será el plantel para afrontar la definición de la tercera categoría. En total hay 20 futbolistas confirmados y aún se aguarda por una resolución favorable en relación a las continuidades de Turraca, Levato y Peppino. Por eso, en caso de que estas negociaciones se resuelvan de buena manera, sólo le quedaría contratar un delantero, un volante por derecha y posiblemente un arquero, de acuerdo a las pretensiones del cuerpo técnico. Por este motivo, y con la cantidad de jugadores ya tiene a disposición, Cavalieri puede empezar a imaginarse un equipo titular en la cabeza y con los posibles suplentes. Con 20 futbolistas, Los Andes tiene gran parte del plantel armado y aguarda por la resolución favorable por Turraca, Levato y Peppino para buscar los últimos refuerzos. En la línea defensiva, con los refuerzos y las continuidades aseguradas, estaría casi completo, a la espera por la firma de Peppino, que a su vez también puede jugar de volante central, algo que hizo bastante desde la llegada del joven entrenador. Los laterales serían los refuerzos Mivervino y Vaca, aunque Levi y Cardozo -dos que siguen de la temporada anterior- podrían pelear por esos lugares, ya que han hecho en lo que se jugó en este 2020. En cuanto a la zaga central, las incorporaciones Cepeda y García tienen algo de ventaja, pero también podrían hacerlo Peppino, a quien Cavalieri usó más de volante que de defensor, y el ex Tristán Suárez, ya que jugó en ese puesto durante el ciclo de Kopriva. En el medio, y en base a lo que fueron los partidos disputados hasta el momento, el DT optó mayoritariamente por un triángulo de tres volantes, con el ex Belgrano como volante central y Pereira e Ibáñez (también lo hizo Maidana) por los costados. Por eso, con la renovación de Ibáñez y la llegada de Rivas, el puesto de internos estaría cubierto (también cuenta con Ortegoza y Maidana) y el mediocampista del centro podría salir de Turraca o Peppino. A pesar de esto, el técnico también sumó a Mbombaj, que puede jugar de volante por izquierda y de extremo por ese sector, y quiere otro volante por derecha en caso de pensar en una línea de cuatro mediocampistas. Y en la delantera, donde preferentemente usó dos extremos (generalmente Galeano y Mazzolatti, pero también Salega) y un referente de área, el panorama también parece cl

Jirga - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre Para el pueblo en Irán, véase Jirgah. Una jirga regional en Jalalabad, Afganistán. Una jirga (ocasionalmente jarga o jargah; pastún: جرګه) es una asamblea tradicional de líderes que toman decisiones por consenso y de acuerdo con las enseñanzas del Islam. Es anterior a las leyes escritas de hoy en día y se lleva a cabo para resolver las disputas entre el pueblo pastún, y en menor medida entre otros grupos cercanos que han sido influenciados por los pastunes (históricamente conocidos como los afganos). Su objetivo principal ha sido evitar las guerras tribales. La mayoría de las jirgas se llevan a cabo en Afganistán, y también entre las tribus pastunes en el vecino Pakistán, especialmente en las Áreas Tribales bajo Administración Federal (ATAF) y Jaiber Pajtunjuá. El consejo de la comunidad puede servir de instrumento para dirimir una disputa entre dos personas; siendo parte del mecanismo de resolución de controversias en este tipo de casos. Los litigantes suelen empezar con la búsqueda de un mediador, que suele ser un importante líder religioso, un notable local o un especialista en mediación (un kan o malik). El mediador escucha a las dos partes y luego forma una jirga de ancianos de la comunidad, teniendo cuidado de incluir partidarios de ambos lados. La jirga entonces considera el caso y, después de discutir el asunto, llega a una decisión acerca de cómo manejar la situación, que el mediador entonces anuncia. La conclusión de las jirgas es obliga

El auto impactó un poste de luz en la autopista Las Américas, luego fue llevado a la Plaza de la Salud y allí le diagnosticaron un trauma craneal moderado, contusión hemorrágica parieto temporal izquierda, una fractura lineal temporal izquierda, cefalohematoma derecho y una fractura distal de peroné derecho, según informó el médico que lo atiende. Dicho informe agrega que éste iba sin cinturón de seguridad y que luego de ingerir alcohol colisionó con un poste de luz en la autopista de Las Américas alrededor de las 4:00 A.M. ¿Qué te parece?

5 de cada 10 mexicanos usaría Internet para buscar casas en renta para las vacaciones Inicio / Noticias / Negocios / 5 de cada 10 mexicanos usaría Internet para buscar casas en renta para las vacaciones Publicado por William Herrera el 5 de diciembre de 2012 a las 13:22 horas De acuerdo a una encuesta realizada por Oh! Panel y MercadoLibre en octubre de este año, 5 de cada 10 mexicanos utilizará Internet para buscar inmuebles en renta y pasar... De acuerdo a una encuesta realizada por Oh! Panel y MercadoLibre en octubre de este año, 5 de cada 10 mexicanos utilizará Internet para buscar inmuebles en renta y pasar las vacaciones decembrinas. Por este motivo, MercadoLibre.com, la mayor plataforma de compras y ventas por Internet de América Latina, emite algunas de las recomendaciones que deben considerarse al momento de rentar una casa o departamento por Internet para las próximas vacaciones. Los clasificados en Internet funcionan de manera similar a los de los diarios impresos. En ambos casos, los arrendadores publican sus datos de contacto (teléfono e email), luego acuerdan un encuentro con los posibles inquilinos y establecen condiciones de renta. En Internet, la diferencia es que los arrendadores pueden publicar fotos y hasta videos para que los interesados puedan conocer el estado de la casa antes de concretar una cita para verla personalmente. En este sentido, la seguridad depende de las precauciones que tomen ambas personas y por ello, hacer uso del sentido común es lo más importante. 2) Antes de pagar la renta o depositar un adelanto, conoce la casa o departamento Para rentar una casa es importante que conozcas el inmueble personalmente, sin que realices algún depósito o pagues por adelantado, pues sólo conociendo la casa estarás seguro de que cumple con tus necesidades. Internet ofrece un medio más eficiente para ahorrar tiempo a la hora de encontrar una casa o un departamento, sin embargo el acuerdo entre ambas partes no difiere al de otros avisos clasificados. Antes de llegar a una negociación con el arrendatario

Danzando, que es gerundio: Que expresamos y que no queremos expresar. El cuerpo es un instrumento expresivo que informa constantemente sobre nuestro estado de ánimo, pensamientos, emociones,... todo esto lo percibe la gente que nos rodea, pudiendo dar una imagen o impresión buena o menos buena. Haciendo de esto un aspecto muy importante ya que va a condicionar muchas situaciones durante la vida. Como ya sabemos le ley exige una serie de contenidos que se deben impartir en secundaria, que desgraciadamente no se imparten de una manera suficientemente correcta en todos los centros, desde la docencia hay que conseguir que el alumno comprenda el valor que tiene el lenguaje no verbal y la expresión corporal, pero me voy a central en la importancia de la desinhibición ya que debe de ser una de las principales funciones educativas dentro de este contenido. Ya no solo nos referimos a la desinhibición desde la asignatura de educación física donde sean capaces de hacer danzas, coreografías y bailes siendo capaces de expresar algo a propósito sino a eliminar esa restricción de expresión emocional, pero ¿puede expresar a propósito una cierta emoción si no se siente de verdad? En el día a día se ve que si se puede solamente tenemos que ver la televisión, pero esto no se consigue solamente con la intención. Por medio del movimiento, gestos y posturas se pueden ocultar en momentos puntuales el estado anímico, pero esto sin una buena desinhibición puede convertirse en un caos. Tu cabeza piensa y quiere expresar aquello que realmente no sientes en ese momento, pero si a esto le añadimos una mala o incompleta desinhibición lleva a realizar mal interpretación, la comunicación no verbal no tendrá fluidez, ritmo, estética,… dejando a medias aquello que se quiere expresar, en cambio con una buena desinhibición y un buen conocimiento del propio esquema e imagen corporal que lleve a realizar los movimientos con unas características determinadas y un gran esfuerzo mental si se puede expresar una emoción aunque en su propio interior haya una emoción contraria. La inhibición o restricción puede llevar a un cierto miedo o terror de la persona por no querer expresar cuál es su estado emocional real, pero se t
