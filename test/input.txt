okay for today wed like you on p23 to make a trunnion bias determination prior to p23 sightings as called out in procedures and also one afterwards our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular readout in the sextant the bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated that is a proceed on noun 87 after you get two consecutive measure ments equal to within 0003 degrees and of course move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements the earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today im sure youre a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are but to ensure that youre getting a good angle measurement between the star and the earth horizon the sextant mline which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the rline should be parallel to the earth horizon at the substellar point and then the actual super imposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant above below or on the mline we recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after auto maneuver if you feel that the amount of time between the auto maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive or that you dont like that auto maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark of course you can use a verb 94 verb 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 positi

good evening id like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission apollo 11 as weve been dis cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft weve come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon more still than the efforts of a government and industry team more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown nells statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon this is a small step for a man but a great leap for mankind i believe sum up these feelings very nicely we accepted the challenge of going to the moon the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission i beieve is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance today i feel were flly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace in retrospect we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously goss net 1 ape 1124 chose for our spacecraft columbia and eagle weve been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight depicting the us eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the earth from the planet earth to the moon that symbol being the olive branch it was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the moon personally in reflecting on the events of the past several days a verse from psalms comes to mind to me when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of h
