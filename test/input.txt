good evening id like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission apollo 11 as weve been dis cussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft weve come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon more still than the efforts of a government and industry team more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown nells statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon this is a small step for a man but a great leap for mankind i believe sum up these feelings very nicely we accepted the challenge of going to the moon the acceptance oj this challenge was inevita01e the relatiw ease with which we carried out our mission i beieve is a tribute to the timeliness of that acteptance today i feel were flly capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of stace in retrospect we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously goss net 1 ape 1124 chose for our spacecraft columbia and eagle weve been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight depicting the us eagle bringing the universal symbo
